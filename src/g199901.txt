    My apology if some of my comments on version 1.3 of Robin's
Glosa grammar description seemed too strong.  There are certain
matters that I do have strong opinions on, and I may have
phrased myself inappropriately.  However, I would like to see
the most effective presentation for Glosa in whatever that form
takes.  The better the presentation the more likely it is that
other people may become interested.

Strong criticism intended to help improve Glosa
cannot be bad ... It is better to solve problems
at the beginning, and it looks like Glosa will
be making a new beginning soon.

I do think that a rigorous modern grammar like
that of Rick Morneau will be needed, as it exposes
all problems from the start, so a complete grammar
will never need to be patched in the future.

It is also easier to specify a minimal set of rules
in B-N notation, understandable to all students of
linguists and computer science, than any other way.

    A new beginning in what sense?  This might almost risk a schism in
what little Glosa movement there is.

    Although it is based on minimal evidence, my suspicion is that Ron
Clark and Wendy Ashby would have nothing to do with anything like this.
I for one still do not know their position on anything going on about
Glosa on the 'net and what they might intend to do about if if they
disagree.  However, along the lines of a couple of my posts in reply to
James Chandler on AUXLANG, I do not think that "scientific design" is
the only thing to consider.  Although he was a polyglot, Zamenhof was
not a professional linguist, and like it or not, Esperanto has been
beating the pants off all competitors for a century.  So much for
"scientific design."  I think some things can be determined
empirically.

    I worked professionally with computers for years, and B-N notation
is rather opaque to me.  My experience was -practical-, not
theoretical.  I am concerned with what works, not theoretical elegance.

It won't contradict them, they won't argue.
I don't really much care what they think anyway.

I do not contemplate any new design at all.
I suggest a rational, transparent analysis of
what already is there, at least in Robin's head.

That is what I call science.

B-N is practical; please read the URL specified earlier.
RM gives a partial B-N for English, to serve as a start.

I am suggesting that Robin's grammar as written is
not sufficient, whereas B-N is; but only Robin seems
to have the intuition of how Glosa really is.

     The Burd paper does nothing to stop me from continuing to use the

"Royal capital" when describing "linguists" as 'Linguists.'

     Linguists are very intelligent - no disputing that: are they using
this intelligence to delude others with their seeming superiority of
intellect; or are they deluding themselves with the sound of their own
terminology?

**   Well, on my second run through Burd's paper, I started to get the
gist.  He does differentiate between the syntactical distinctions made
within some languages (marking Head & dependent lexemes differently)

and semantic distinctions within languages (marking Predicate & object
lexemes differently) and does suggest that there is a matrix that shows
different combinations of these parameters among the different
natlangs.

     Burd does mention clauses acting as linguistic units equivalent to
individual words, and he does mention, only briefly, the concept of
"modifiers", but restricts following discussion solely to adjectives.


     He gives one nice example of VBP-speak (Very Bright Person) :-

   "noun: a lexical item representing a semantic object (saturated
predicate) which is without further modification a syntactic actant."


     Before commenting on this work, and revealing Glosa's place in the
grand sceme of things, I would - for non-VBP's - rewrite Burd's matix to
make it immediately understandable to the non-Linguists on Glosalist:-


      Semantic -----> Predicate/object sensetive

 Syntactic         +---------------------+--------------------+

 |                 |       Yes           |       No           |

             |     |  N, V/Adj marked    |   None marked      |

 [I hope this formatting comes across on your screen; otherwise,

   I will repost
with~all~whitespace~filled.]<color><param>0000,ffff,0000</param>
~~~~~~

</color>

   So, as was stated, all along, Glosa is in the fourth category with

Tongan and Mundari, where the Parts-of-Speech (Verb, Noun, Adjective
forms of a concept) have the same lexeme.


   What Burd has done is to alert us to the dichotomy in linguistic
understanding, between the syntactic analysis - based on word
positioning, and the semantic analysis - based on the meaning that is
being conveyed.

   However, Burd has used the terms, "verb", "noun" and "adjective"
throughout his paper as if these are solid objects.  Surely, he should
have differentiated between words which were recognisable "nouns", etc,
and those lexemes that were functioning, in the particular instance, as
"nouns", etc.


   In the type-4 languages, words are NOT "verbs", "nouns" or
"adjectives", but can function -- without changing their physical form --

as either "verbs", nouns" or "adjectives" depending on the intention of
the utterer, and the way in which this person has followed the rules of
grammar of the particular type-4 language they are using - to ensure that
the particular function they intended, is the one that is understood by
the reciever of the communication.


   While I cannot vouch for Tongan, Mundari or Tagalog, which are most
likely full of special usages that adulterate the rule of no
morphological changes for different Parts-of-Speech, I can say
categorically that this type-4 rule is a foundation stone of Glosa, and
is observed in its use.  Hogben did fvour the type-1 situation in
Interglossa, but stressed the "Concept Language" quality of his creation.


   Clark and Ashby maintain the 'Concept Language' feature, but realise
that the marking of Parts-of-Speech is redundant when Syntax-based
Grammar is applied.  EG kurso [run, runs, ran, running, to run]  This
concept-word covers the concept of *running*, and can be used, within
reason - and observing the laws of syntax - as any part of speech.


 An kurso ad u boteka.  [He runs to the shop.]


 Plu ju-an kurso a sko-do.  [The boys run to school.]


 Tem kurso to u parka, an pa kade.  [While running at the park, he
fell.]


 Te ariva pre Okta Hora fe nece kurso fo celero.  [To arrive before Eight
   O'Clock, she must run very quickly.]


 Pre exercisa, mi fu vesti-auto intra kurso-vesti.  [ Before exercising,
I will clothe myself in (put on) running clothes.]


 Mi vo kurso la; ka mi vo gene sani.  [I want to run there, because I
want to get healthy (fit).]


 Akti id kurso.  [Do it running.]


 Mu pa gene lose in u celero-kurso fluvi.  [They were lost in the
fast-running river.


 An pa tende kurso a mi, sed mi dice ad an: greso.  [He intended to run
to me, but I told him to walk.]


   Thus, I have categorised Glosa, and have given exaples of Glosa
sentences demonstrating that it is, in fact, a type-4 languge.

   An now I would go beyond Burd's conclusion to say that that type-4
languages comprise unmarked lexemes, not Parts-of-Speech.  It iswrong to
say that, in Glosa, the Verb is equivalent to the Noun, and that both are
equivalent to the Adjective: this puts the ^boot on the wrong foot^.  In
reality the concept-word, for a particular abstract idea, can function as
one of the different Parts-of-Speech: in use, the fact that the lexeme is
"functioning as" a particular Part-of-Speech, and NOT that part of
speech, should be indicated.

   While each sentence has its Verb Phrase (VP) and Noun Phrases (NP),
and we can talk of the Verb and Predicate in the abstract, when it gets
down to specific lexemes, I would strongly recommend using notation to
show that the lexeme's function in the particular sentence is
transitory.

To achieve this I have used the single parenthesis:

  'verb' = lexeme functioning as a verb

  'noun' = lexeme functioning as a noun

  'adjective' = lexeme functioning as an adjective

  'adverb' = lexeme functioning as an adverb


    Briefly, the open class of words in Glosa (or substantives) can
function as verbs, nouns or modifiers.  The modifier category covers both
'adjectives' and 'adverbs'.  With Head Final structure in both Noun
Phrases and Verb Phrases, modifier(s) are paced before the substantive
word, whether it be 'noun' or 'verb'.

Well, this is a technical paper intended for specialists,
but it isn't beyond reach of the interested amateur.
The idea of the 4-way split is apparently original with him,
and from reading his other papers, he is the anti-thesis of
an ivory-towerist or capitalist henchman ...

The key phrase is his "without further modification".
Every language has ways of turning verb into noun,
or using a word usually of one class as another --
that is the "further modification". So "WFM" is really
a cute way of thumbing his nose at terminology ...

I see no difference. Things are whatever they are,
but we call them by names that really are quite arbitrary.

Glosa uses word order as the only means of indicating word class.
Glosa is head-last within a phrase. Particles (or pronouns,
or prepositions) mark the beginning of a phrase. Hyphenation
is used to disambiguate within a phrase. Is that correct?

The lexeme isn't going to be a problem once you decide
there is no morphology and the head comes last.
The only difficulty is finding the phrase boundaries.
Small word-particles like "u" and "pa" and "ad" work fine,
as in Chinese and as in Hogben's original idea (I think).

In the dictionary project, it might be wise to keep in
mind that particles should be small (1 or 2 letters)
and regular words a bit larger; "trans" isn't so good
as a preposition and I would avoid it, using a verb
like "crossing" instead. It makes reading much easier,
and makes the clunky ";" and ":" dispensable.

No disagreement on that, it is similar to standard pidgin.

    I would specify, rather, that marker particles be a single
syllable when practical, regardless of how many letters it
takes to spell them.  And I'm not sure I quite understand the
objection to 'trans.' At least part of the idea of Glosa
vocabulary is to use words which are a modicum of somewhat
recognizable from Greco-Latin roots.  'Trans' fits into this
category, I would say.  The book "18 Steps to Fluency in
Euro-Glosa" (an infelicitous name) has a useful diagram
illustrating spacial prepositions (and a few modifiers),
and 'trans' seems no worse to me than any of the others.

    My intention, at least, is not to reinvent the language
but only to clarify a few things from exsting materials,
standardize the vocabulary, and improve the presentation.

Colors don't come through in email, though they

Maybe the ticks indicate the true phrase boundaries,

actually the term is "prosody" or some such.

    Suppose I wanted to write out Thursday, 7 January 1999.

Thursday: di penta

7 January: di septi, meno mo

How can we distinguish 'di X' as a day of the week and 'di X' as a date
within a month?

    There is also the question of distinguishing "after three hours"
and "after three o'clock" (this problem arises with other languages as
well).  If it is now one o'clock, "after three hours" = 'po tri horo'
indicates the same as "after four o'clock," definitely not the same as
"after three o'clock."  'Po tri horo' thus is ambiguous.

Too long for a particle; prepositions are particles AFAIK.
Conversely, some lexical items are too short,
and can look like particles, e.g. "ala" vs. "ali".
Prepositions are inherently ideosyncratic, and
known to be treacherous for new (L2) learners.
All lexicals (any that are added) should be approx 4 or 5
letters long, to avoid such confusions; also, ideally
they should be CVCV style to fit the overall phonology.

In meaning? It think it ought to go back to being a
well-behaved verb, in all auxlangs. Most of the Oriental
languages do not use "across" as Indo-European does.
Other than for indirect objects and genitives,
why use prepositions at all? I would have thought
infinitives require one, but Robin just uses them raw.

    True.  But several Glosa prepositions are bisyllabic.  Come to
think of it, I might retract the remark that particles should all
be monosyllables when possible.  Again, there is -- or at least is
supposed to be -- an element of mnemonicity in the Glosa vocabulary
which might take some precedence over other considerations.

    I for one, at least, do not see it as my task to rebuild Glosa
from the ground up.  As much as possible I am trying to work within
the language as it already is.  I am not trying to make a new
pseudo-Glosa.  (I already did one exercise in language rebuilding
with frater2, although I never finished the vocabulary.)

My remarks about prepositions were directed toward
*new* vocabulary *additions*.

My remarks about syntax were directed toward
*clear* specification of *existing* language.

    I am trying to avoid additions insofar as possible, merely working

    I am not sure that we have a disagreement here as such.  Perhaps a
difference of opinion as to the most effective way to accomplish this.

    It may well be a misunderstanding on my part, but I almost got
the impression somehow that you were trying (or at least willing) to
rebuild Glosa into something else (in which case it would not longer
be Glosa).  Please correct me if my impression is erroneous.

You will hereby be corrected in full ...

I see Glosa as incomplete in several areas,
yet basically in design it is simply a pidgin,
which gives very little leeway for creativity:

Phonology: mostly CV syllables.
Morphology: none to speak of.
Syntax: subject-verb-object, adjective-noun.
Lexicon: simplified Latin and Greek roots.

Hogben's original idea is still maybe 40% present.
I had read about it 20 years ago, and was quite
disappointed recently, to see its current state.
However, it is the only pidgin/creole type artificial
language having some significant amount of good
publicity, and that could be the way to go for an
international auxiliary language.

The flaws of Glosa are probably correctable,
and I see some efforts here to do so. But,
the competition (Euroclones and some natlangs)
is strong, so a half-hearted effort will *not*
be sufficient ... Glosa would die. If it can't be
simpler and in some senses better than natlangs,
then it isn't worth the effort.

On the other hand, I do have conlang interests
as well, and am quite unafraid to wade through
the technical literature in search of better
understanding of language. Also, I like parts
of Ido and other IALs, and would like to see
any of them either reform themselves technically
or become more popular or both. On this list
I am only concerned with pushing Glosa away
from hobby status, and toward real usefulness.

I would appreciate never having to speak of
my motives or intentions again. Please
criticize only ideas, not persons.

    It was not my intention to criticize you personally.  If
that is what came across, I apologize for the erroneous
impression.  I was responding to what I thought might be your

    But I have crossed the line, on occasion, when describing the Hard and
Soft varieties of Glosa.  Ron Clark terms it 'telegramatic' or
'vernacualar' Glosa, and Paul dislikes unnecessary redundancy in the use of
particles; I believe that there is a base-lined 'verbose' Glosa, which
includes all markers - mainly for learning purposes - and which can be
vernacularised, progressively, by the learner as he/she gains
fluency.  However, I have never imagined that the Hard and Soft versions of
Glosa are different dialects.

Saluta,

mathematical, formal logic, approach to communication, and am not good at
imposing other systems of grammar "retrospectively" onto Glosa.

 </bold>Hello Friends,

  Here I Attach the completed WORK.FIL of Glosa words matching the
original list from Bill Patterson.

  A large part of the "missing" words had their equivalent members in the
Glosa dictionary before we commenced this work.

  For several words, I included an alternative Glosa form: please help
with the selection of one from these pairs.

  Alternatively, various English words got two or three Glosa versions.

Please give your opinion on these multiple listings.


  A few English words did not produce a suitable Glosa word, so I ignored
them.  Many English words got translated into compound forms (located in
the second column); and several of the English words needed new Glosa
words, which I got from the Latin Dictionary (located in the third
column).


 WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!

   The Attached file is very long.  Possibly it will not get through your
system.


   Please inform me of any difficulty with this transfer, and I will seek
an alternative mode of sending it to you.

   Please hold onto this file of words "missing" from the "Glosa 6000"
list, but note, few of the words in this new list will get into the new
abbreviated "2.5K Glosa" dictionary

 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

P.S. I hope this is not too long for the Internet.  Now, while I'm in the
mood, I ought to start looking at a reduction of the 6000 list down to a
target of 2000.


Saluta,

Based on Glosa's official type-4 adjective class
(this is not official linguistic terminology)
there must be relative clauses; so that "that"
that was mentioned needs to be kept around ...
The innovative part, IIUC, is that there are
different "that"s for adjectival versus adberbial
clauses (???). This needs some clarification.
I didn't even mention resumptive pronouns yet.

At some point the grammar must specify how
to attach phrases unambiguously to avoid
(or encourage?) the infamous "I saw a
man running after the cat with a broom
in underwear" sort of thing.

That is entirely reasonable, and many languages do
exactly that; just say Glosa is very "pro-drop"
(elides whenever the speaker feels like it)
and then everybody is happy.

    "That" even as a conjunctive in English has more than one usage.
I might be able to live with some usage or another in Glosa, but it
most definitely needs to be specified which "that" is being used, and
if necessary use more than one construct.  Some Glosa correspondent to
the English "that" introducing a substantive clause is how I
interpreted the original 'ke' in Glosa.

    Such a use is entirely different from the "that" in "It was so cold
that the old man died," in which "that" is a different conjunctive
introducing result, consequence, or purpose (as may be).  I proposed in
one example using 'seqe-co' for the latter "that."  Let us please not
import into Glosa the overloading of grammatical function words that
occurs in English or some other natlangs.  Such an overloading just
introduces confusion and ambiguity.  We must definitely try vigorously
to avoid being misled by our mother tongues.

*   Not at all.  The distinction remains ... by ^rule of thumb^ if you can photocopy something, page by page, then it can be copyrighted; if the thing is unique every time - like spoken language - then it is beyond the rules of copyright.  The Authors have vested ownership of the dictionaries and other Glosa printed materials in a corporate body, the GEO.

    In theory, working through a "charity" structure gives the authors considerable advantage .. in England .. over operation as individuals or as a private, tax-paying company.  In the UK, it also confers considerable 'status'.  Of course, all of this 'charity' stuff is now somewhat upstaged by the Internet!

*   I disagree.  No-one can copyright English, and the Glosa authors cannot copyright their social invention, Glosa.  But every English-language dictionary is copyrighted, just as the Glosa dictionaries are also copyright.

    There is NO thought of the authors taking me - or the Glosalist subscribership - to court on account of a _Glosa Few-thousand_ being produced mainly from their 1000 and 6000 lists.

 . It would be counterproductive for Glosa dissemination.

 . The authors would not have the money to wage a legal battle.

 . No judge would rule that a _Glosa Umpty-thousand_ dictionary,

handworked from the entries of _Glosa 6000_, is a breach of copyright.

    When I see the English sentence, I can think about it and do a
rendition into Glosa.

*   This one is obvious:-

 "I saw a man .. in underwear .. with a broom .. running after a cat."

  The trio of phrases comprise one complex Adjectival Clause:
 " who was wearing underwear, holding a broom, and running after a cat."

And there probably is a heirarchy operating here ... with an increasing
order of significance as the sentence progresses:-
 wearing 'underwear' is an assumed - we all do it;
 but 'with a broom' starts us wondering - what is he going to do with it;
 and when we get to the 'cat' - we have our resolution.

If I put some time into it, I could find the basis of this heirarchy.

The fundamental characteristic is the 'knock-on effect': what happens first
impacts on the next, and so on, with things ^snowballing^ as the sentence
builds up.  The Glosa authors expressed it, in relation to the sequence of
words, as "a word is influenced by it's precedent".  Maybe the same applies
with the larger chunks of the sentence, too.

   Are we going to chase the cat with a broom, while standing in our
underwear, or be in underwear, holding a broom, while chasing a cat?
I believe that the risiing plane of intensity is the more dramatic, and the
way to go.

    Perhaps some melding of meaning can occur within Glosa.  It is my
understanding that Glosa does not - in all possible cases - split hairs.
    If you can list and label the various "That"s as you see them, then we
could all think about these possible differentiations of usage.

*   The WORK.FIL is simply a "working file", like a 'work in progress'
following from Bill Patterson's publishing last year a list of
English-language words for which he could not find equivalents in the Glosa
6000 list.  I laboriously checked through the seemingly omitted words
tracking them down in the current Glosa dictionaries .. or, if they were
not represented there, I created a compound of existing Glosa words ..
while in some rare cases, I used the Latin dictionary to "coin" Glosa words.

   I suspect that all this means the Glosa authors let few concepts through
their net, and most of the omitted words could readily be fixed up with
Glosa equivalents.  Thus very few wordsneed to be conscripted from this
"omitted" list to be included in a Net dictionary.  A small number of
serious omissions come to mind, for which it seemed new Glosa words would
be needed, such as ~utor~ [employ], ~job~ rather than ~ergo~ [job], and
~   ~ [statement].

   From the above, I gather that the long attachment did come through.  I
intend to test the system even more with the entire Eng-Glo_2.5K file, next.

   Please check out the new words and the compounds .. for your agreement.
You might also check over the single words I gave as Glosa translations of
the 'missing' English words.

advertisement - PUBLIKO was suggested. My files say that PUBLIKO =

   ADVERTI or ADVERTI-something. I prefer simply ADVERTI.

annul - KANCELA was suggested but KANCELA = "lattice". Suggestions?

beginning - PROTO and KOMENCE were suggested. I prefer KOMENCE because
   it meshes better with the other definitions of the words. There is
   also Glosa RUDIMENTA = "beginnings". If we consider "beginning" and
   "beginnings" to be close enough in meaning, we could use it.

belong - HABITA was suggested. According to my files, HABITA = "dwell"
   or "inhabit". The old finalvowel problem again? Although I could
   almost make a case for this. Anyway, how about PERTINE which is
   already in the dictionary? ("Belong" should not have been in the
   omissions list. I think it got there through a programming or data
   formatting error.)

camera - FOTO-GRAFI KAMERA was suggested, but KAMERA = "room". How about
   just FOTO-GRAFI-ME?

discovery - DETEKTI was suggested, but since HEURESI = "discover", why
   don't we use it instead?

Adding to Robin's comments that I just read... I took your Basic
Vocabulary, removed some things that wouldn't apply in Glosa, and
then compared it with the full Glosa dictionary to look for missing
words, thus generating the omissions list. Naturally, I neglected to
remove some of the inapplicable Basic words, so there are some words
on the omissions list that should not be there. For example, words
in Glosa that are formed via generics, and English spelling differences
between the two files, British vs. American, that sort of thing.

The original omissions list is at

It would be wise to peruse the entire list of Esperanto
suffixes, Interlingua's too; because we must be able to
translate them somehow. Eo's are more ingenious and,
as we say, "orthogonal"; Ia's are the Standard Average
European derivational series.

Who was the who? This is really a nasty example, that starts
out easy then becomes impossible. In many langs, disambiguating
the referents "cat" and "person" is easy because there are
inanimate vs. animate pronouns, "it" vs. "him/her"; not an
appropriate solution in Glosa tho.

I don't think that works, because I've never heard of that

Though it uses phrases, the better way might be to re-cast as
participles or clauses; then we get into how to clearly mark
dependent clauses like in Morneau's "Syntax" article.

"I, dressed in underwear, saw a man running down the street
carrying a broom and pursuing a cat".

My strategy is to replace treacherous prepositions with verbs,
place adverbial phrases adjacent to their verbs, and separate
the rest with pauses noted by commas or semicolons.

Use of resumptive pronouns as in Persian might be a good idea.
It is already established that Glosa will be the type of lang
that uses relative clauses, unlike Chinese and Turkish which
have a way to dispense with them (with other drawbacks).
True pidgins also dispense with RC's, but Glosa aims higher.

    "That" has various uses in English.  Two are those of demonstrative
pronoun and adjective.  I am not concerned with such uses here, as
there does not seem to be a great problem in Glosa with such.  However,
as a conjunction and a relative pronoun, "that" has numerous uses which
are not at all the same.  Such confusion should most definitely NOT be
smuggled into a constructed auxlang.

    For instance, "that" can introduce a substantive (or noun)
subordinate clause: 'He said that he was afraid.'  'that he was afraid'
is a substantive clause which is the direct object of "said."

    As a relative pronoun, "that" can introduce an adjectival
subordinate clause: 'This is the house that Jack built.'  Even in
English, one could here often substitute "which" for "that," but
nevertheless the "that" construction is legal and occurs.

    In my former example, "that" introduces an adverbial subordinate
clause: "It was so cold that the old man died."

    "That" can even be used to introduce an optative construction: "Oh,
that he might come!"

    My desk dictionary lists numerous refinements of "that" being used
to introduce various kinds of noun, adjectival, and adverbial clauses.
To try to collapse all of this morass of English usage into a similarly
overloaded single word in Glosa is folly, in my opinion.  There may be
the danger of trying to smuggle the entire apparatus of English clause
structure into Glosa, giving further credence to the charge that Glosa
is little more than recoded English -- in which case, why not junk
Glosa, ask people to expend a little more effort to learn English, and
use English as the global auxiliary language (which it now nearly is,
anyway)?

Robin did those. I believe that...

"Found in GEO" means, as you said, that Robin found them; so from the
point of view of the GEO they weren't really omissions, I just didn't
have them! The "Suggested" column contains either words that already
exist and are similar in meaning to the omission, or words that can
be created by compounding words that exist. And "New Forms" consists
of brand new words taken from Latin or Greek.

That should have been "quasi-perfective," NOT "quasi-imperfective."

exclusive - We have EXKLUDE (exclude) and could use it for this too.

acknowledge - How about REKOGNI (recognize)?

brass - CUPRI-ZINK was suggested, but we have KUPRA (copper), so KUPRA-ZINK?

afternoon - Since noon is MESO-DI (noon), how about PO-MESO-DI?

compound - KOMPOSITO (composite) could handle this meaning too.

dictionary - VERBI-BIBLI is good for the preferred word, since it
   compounds two Glosa roots. We also have LEXIKO and LEXIKON. I don't
   think we need DIKTIONARIA in addition to those three... hmmm... I
   *do* like the looks of it... okay, let's add it, for the literary
   dictionary! But I do think VERBI-BIBLI should be preferred.

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 12 Jan 99 23:2


label - I have NOMINA but not NIMA; how about NOMINA-BILETA?

likely - Rather than POSI (perhaps), how about PROBABILI (probable)?
   Seems more positive to me.

pride - TARQINI (haughty, proud). That one even *looks* proud to me!

proposal - PROPOSI (propose).

radio - RADIO was suggested, but we have RADIO (ray, spoke).

such - Here we find one of those Glosa oddities. We have U TALI (such -
   from Latin "talis") and TALI (heel - from Latin "talus"). One of
   these needs to be changed! Suggestions? Mine is to use TALU for heel.
   Not only because it retains the original vowel, but also because
   "such" has probably been used more often than "heel" in existing
   literature.

advice  - In my file I find ADVOKA = AD+VOKA (call). Instead, how about
   using KONCILIA (advise) also as a noun?

suggestion - Rather than SUGERE, couldn't we just use SUGESTI (suggest)
   as a noun?

unit - We already have UNITA (trait), so we need something else for "unit".

grateful - We have GRATIA so we don't need GRACE. (Somehow that sounds
   odd.) So, GRATIA-PLE.

jealousy - We have ZELOSO (jealous); could it stand also for "jealousy"?

metric - METRO SISTEMA was suggested, but I prefer METRA SISTEMA or
   METRI SISTEMA, since METRA = "metre" (the system with metres), and
   METRI = "measure" (the system of measures), and METRO = "mother".

mile - We can't use MILE because currently MILE=KILO=thousand.

conscience - AUTO-KRITIKI was suggested. I like that one! Currently we
   have KRITICI=criticize, but I'm not sure whether I prefer the C or K
   at the end. Preference, anybody?

supper - We already have CENA (dinner). It could be used. Or we could add
   KENA, similar but different, more like the Latin, if we want to make
   the distinction.

calculate, calculator - We have SUMA (add,sum,total). We could use this word
   also for calulate, and calulcator could be SUMA-RU. Or SUMA-ME, similar
   to PUTA-ME for computer.

television - TELE-VIDE was suggested, and this reminded me of the "radio"
   question. And German. We have TELEFONA (telephone) (though "sound"
   is FONO; terminal vowels again). "Radio" could be a TELE-(hear,listen).
   Unfortunately, all the appropriate Glosa words begin with a vowel;
   TELE-AUDI, TELE-AKUSTI, TELE-ASKOLTA, and TELE-AUSKULTA seem awkward.
   Actually, TELE-DICE might be more appropriate for Glosa's "telephone",
   and then TELE-FONA could be radio; but that would be a terrible False
   Friend, wouldn't it? SONI is another Glosa word for "sound"; I'm
   thinking of this solution...

      TELEFONA = telephone (or TELEFONO)
      TELESONI = radio
      TELEVIDE = television

Hello,

   I am now trying to promote Glosa through this new Internat journal.

   The first thing I must do, is translate from English into the language
I wish to promote.


   When we research _Babel_ we will possibly decide it is a suitable
publishing location for items from Glosalist subscribers.


   Here, attached to this letter, I send you the test-text, which I
needed to translate into Glosa.  In a following post, I send you my Glosa
version.


   The test-text caused several problems with:-

    . a lot of vernacular language,

    . the use of plurals .. especially with ~vi~ and ~tu~,

    . changing from plural to singular within one sentence, and

    . several incomplete sentences.


   Also, I introduced the "^" marks for non-literal language, and with
various sentences, I changed the sentence structure.


/* Hint: As I did above, I find it a lot easier to write the Glosa first,
then render it into English, than to go the other way. */

centimeter - CENTI-METRI was suggested, but we already have CENTI (hundred)
   and CENTIPEDI (centipede). We need a new word for "hundredth". Or a
   better solution would probably be to use CENTIMETRA, with CENTI=hundredth
   and HEKTO=hundred, as in the Metric System. And then we'd have HEKTOPEDI.
   The downside is that we'd be inconsistent with existing literature.

equitable - Oops! We already have JUSTI (fair (equitable)) and JUSTI (just
   (equitable)), but somehow never defined JUSTI (equitable)!

hemp - SATIVA was suggested, but we have SATIVU (cultivated), which reminded
   me that the "sativa" in "cannabis sativa" means "cultivated". How about
   KANABIS, from Latin "cannabis", instead?

keen - We have ALAKRI (brisk, crisp, eager)? Could we fit "keen" into here?

into two bits: the PAST and the PERFECT.  It is fairly academic, anyway,
since ~pra~ is Old Glosa.  But, from my pragmatic point of view, one
particle beats two.
 . ~du~ = "continues to"
 . ~pa du~ = "continued to" .. more 'continuous' than 'unfinished' to me.

 . There used to be a ~parato~ [already] but that must be O.G. also!
    U kani parato fago mi pedi-ve.
   [the dog (had) already eat(en) my shoe]

 . To separate the functions (Past&Perfect) we could use ~previo~ in the
form, ~pa previo~ = "did previosly", or ~kompleti" [completely] in the form
~pa kompleti~ = "did completely".  And if this makes Glosa easier for
Russians to learn, who am I to make things difficult by wanting to
resurrect the dead ~pra~?
 . How on Earth do the English get away with "had" = ''did completely'',
anyway? EG  "I had done it before lunch."
           [I did completely do it before lunch]
            Mi pra akti id pre meso-vora.  O.G.
            Mi pa kompleti akti id pre meso-vora.  Mod.Glosa

*   ???  When in doubt, use "U".  Just because ~u~ is the 'noun marker'
shouldn't mean that we can't use it to say something like: "Listen buddy,
the next main word you see will be a noun: O.K.?"

*   True, but the Glosa authors have adopted the COUNT/UNCOUNT distinction
from English - probably, again, for good logical reasons - and I am having
trouble identifying the Glosa version of "some" for Countables.  ~u mero
de~ quite happily comes across as "a bit of" OR "some(UNCOUNT)", but I am
racking my brain to for the Glosa way of saying something like, "He bought
some apples."
    ~plura~ will do, but it seems a mouthful, when the situation calls for
a one-syllable word.  I don't like to push the lexicon, but the neatest
solution I can come up with is a derivative of the French `des` [of the].
EG  An pa merca plura pomo. ......  An pa merca des pomo.
    [he did buy several apples]  .. [he did buy some apples]

   In Glosa, there is a range of Determinant-Indicator words that come at
the start of a Noun Phrase:-
 u = (noun), a, the
 plu = (plural Noun), the (plural)
 u-ci = this [the-here]
 plu-ci = these [the(plural) here]
 u-la =that [the there]
 plu-la = those [the(plural) there]
 plura = several
 (u) mero de = some of
 ali = any
 ali de u = any of the
 u holo = the whole
 holo de u = all of the
 poli = many

    And I am still not convinced that Glosa should ape the horrendous
English verb system.  Native speakers may not realize what a true mess
it really is.  A -planned- language can plan away such monstrosities.

    I count at least two entirely superfluous instances of 'pa', and if
there were a perfective marker in place of 'pra' things would be fine.

    I would think that aspect would be well enough known among language
planners that it would not be necessary to use examples from such a
messed-up verb system like that of English.  At the risk of becoming
tiresome, Glosa should not ape English's abominable verb system.

    Do tell: is "B-N" Binary Notation? Is it something like a "Botanical
Key" for the identification of plants?  I am obviously NOT a 'real' student
of either Linguistics or Computer Science, because I don't even recognise
the intials for this notation.
    But I'm sure that a couple of words from you will make it all plain.

    There are various combinations, but the main differences are in the way

    Alternative: write the name of the day of the week; and use the number

                    Di-septi, 7 Meno-mo

    Ultra brief WRITTEN version:-

*   This is harder to disambiguate, but should be done with another
marker-word as was done with ~datu~ above.
    The word ~tem~ suggests itself; in combination with ~horo~, we get
~horo-tem~ [hour's time].  And, continuing in the same vein, we can enlist
~kron~ [measure of time, point in time] to handle the hours of the day:
there is ~horo-kron~ or the abbreviation, ~ho'kron~, being a Glosa version
of "O'Clock".

    Amazingly, all this comes out very nicely:-
     pre tri horo-tem  [in less than three hour's time]
     in seqe bi horo-tem  [in the next two hours]
     po deka horo-tem  [after ten hours]
     id es Six horo-kron  [it is six O'Clock]
     pre Six ho'kron  [before six O'Clock]  {shorter version}
     na habe bi ho-tem pre Six ho'kron [we have two hours before Six]
     tu nece habe bi horo te akti id  [you'll need two hours to do it]
     u tem nu eqa Penta horo [it is now Five|the time is now 5 O'Clock]

Suggested additions to the Glosa lexicon:-
  . Capitalisation for: hours of the day    Mo horo\Mo ho'kron
                        days of the week    Di-bi|Bi
                        months of the year  Meno-tri|Tri
  . horo-tem    (duration)
  . ho-tem      (  "  "  - abbreviation)
  . horo-kron   (hour of the day)
  . ho'kron     ( "    "  "   " , O'Clock)

*   This is the scary part.
    I am getting feedback that absorbing Glosa ^by osmosis^ is very hard to
do.  The first _Glosa 6000_ dictionary had more grammatical detail in it
than the recent, 1992, edition, and I hark back to what I remember from
this first publication.
    Also, it was only after much mental straining, that I intuitively
discovered that the "Head Final" structure, they talked about on Conlang,
was another version of the Glosa epithet, that a word is modified by its
precedent(s).
    And years afterwards, while trying to study some grammar, my intuition
was supported by statements about English-language Functional Grammar
having the words, of a Head Final phrase, on a ^rising plane^, i.e. there
really was a proscribed sequence for the ordering of words in a phrase, and
it was one of 'increasing importance'.
    Now, I don't think that Hogben mentioned anything about this, and the
Glosa authors did not, either; however, the 'Head Final' business must have
been perceived intuitively, and even at the subconscious level, by Clark
and Ashby, because it formed their thinking about syntax; and, from the
start, similar glimmerings of perception must also have been in Hogben's
mind when he selected the sentence structure of English as his basic model
for that of Interglossa.

>> I think some things can be determined empirically.
>That is what I call science.
>
*   But with our imperfect knowlege of how language works ... and how the
mind works ... how much science can be applied to the ^art^ of
communication?  I read Villain's books, _Good English_, _Better English_,
and _The Best English_ in sequence .. to be both shocked and delighted to
learn - in the last - that the 'best' users of English were so, because
they knew how to *break* the rule, creatively: theirs were not the normal
boring phrases, but the unexpected ones!

    One feels naked and exposed!
    Me .. only .. I thought Glosa was a good idea that just needed a bit of
a following, and it would take off!?
    Seems like a big blunder of judgment on my part!!
    I'm not unrepentant, I just guess that everybody's been so busy making
capitalism work for them, that they have failed to bounce back - after the
war - to pre-war, relaxed conditions when people did strange, altruistic
things.
    If the B-N thing can be humanised to cope with the ^round corners^ and
^soft edges^ of language, then I'd like to be part of the process - as far
as it goes for Glosa.

    I still think that there is an enormous problem with the human use of
language, and that much more Deep Thought is needed before we reach the
solution.

 Robin G.

    I'll have to admit this is fairly cute ^nose thumbing^ in the use of

    If everything must be dusted off, and placed in its appropriate drawer,
then the language is a 'dead' museum exhibit.  Whereas if there is some
^oil and mud^ on the words, and even some ^blood and guts^ in their
delivery, we get real language, which, though not obviously following
rules, carries the full force of emotion, and which may look and sound
wrong if cleaned up, like that famous song: "I cannot get any satisfaction."

     We understand this to be the way Glosa works, but I feel that it is
necessary to differentiate between this "Syntax-based" approach and the
more inflected, highly-marked system that obtains in most natlangs .. when
teaching people Glosa.

*   The Glosa system does appear to work, as Clark and Ashby said it would,
twenty years ago.  The Phrase Boundary situation does seem to favour some
redundancy, in the form of using the various categories of particles.
    Myself, having once worked as a teacher, am very conscious of the
situation of a first time learner being presented with Glosa.  This is my
reason for trying to imagine how the Glosa system of grammar will be
taught.  In fact, Klaus Langkilde, at Oak Log Middle School, Atlanta, has
demonstrated that Primary School children do readily pick up the
fundamentals of Glosa - more quickly than the adults of Auxlang/Glosalist,
I am sorry to say.  I guess that you could say, in considering the
mass-teaching problems of Glosa, I am conducting a problem-solving exercise
for a problem that hasn't happened yet.

>
*   Yes, Prepositions have generally been kept short and 'comfortable to
say', but ~trans~ does seem to have slipped through.  However, it doesn't
feel too bad to me as a Preposition, EG
 Fe ki trans u via.  [She goes across the road.] {Rolls off the tongue easily}
    But as a 'verb' I find it less comfortable, EG
 U ju-fe pa trans u fluvi per navi.  [The girl crossed the river by boat.]

    An alternative for short prepositional use, might be ~dia~ = through,
across, diagonally, EG
 Un alti andra pa greso dia un agri.
[The tall man walked through|across the field.]

*   The fact that only a handful of Auxlang/Glosalist subscribers have

*   Statistically, chronologically, and organisationally Clark-Ashby
are running out of people, time, and steam.  They mightn't like the fact
that a lot of authoritarian people like grammar books, but they are stuck
with the fact that language research attracts a lot of control freaks who
believe they ^have ways of making you talk^.
    I won't guarantee that a good cyber dictionary and cyber grammar will
make Glosa ^go like a rocket^, but I think they will cause an acceleration
in the language's dissemination. ... And hopefully, will not be so far from
the authors ideals, that such electronic publishing causes any
disagreements between groups of Glosa speakers.

>I for one still do not know their position on anything going on about

*   My understanding is that the authors would be ecstatic to recieve
e-mails from complete strangers who found their language on the Net, and
gave it a whirl.  I am a great believer in ^the proof of the pudding being

*   There is, apart from 'theory' and 'empirical study', also the 'nature'
of language, itself.  This is the area of Glosa's contribution to Language
Reform that I have been pushing , quite unsuccessfully, for a number of
years: I have described it as the "intuitive feel" for language, known to
poets and creative writers.
    An analogy, in another area of communication has: the *composer*;
the person *who has perfect pitch and remembers all his tunes*; and the
person, who knows little theory and may not be able to whistle a tune, but
*plays from the heart, with feeling*.
    In art, it is called "letting the medium talk to you".  I believe that
we should be listening harder to the medium of language to discover what it
is saying to us!

    From the above, you will understand that I like both order and a level
of organised chaos, but lean in the direction of "what works".
    Perhaps some of us come up with a ^rule of thumb^ grammar for Glosa,
and Charles can teach us how to 'B-N_ise' it.

RM has just changed ISPs, so the new URL for his essays is
http://www.srv.net/~ram/essays.html
and the most appropriate of them is
http://www.srv.net/~ram/syntax.html

Quoting from this essay:

: The notational system I will use will be extremely simple -
: I will use a modified version of Backus-Naur Form (BNF)
: because it is more powerful and less confusing
: than the system normally used by linguists.

It has a partial BNF syntax of English, which could be
adapted to Glosa, I think. It highlights things like
relative clauses, complete with examples and discussion
of how other languages handle such things.

All of the above must happen; they are only competing priorities,

Uh, well if nobody else does, I may come up with something.
Browse through Morneau's essay on "syntax" to see if you'd like it.

More likely, Glosa needs actual speakers on this list, right away.

I have thought of writing a HTML form page to translate
to/from Glosa; of course this would be re-packageable
as an offline unix-filter-like command-line-program.
It is easier to do this for an analytic lang like Glosa,
than something synthetic like Ido. If anybody has some
thoughts to add on this, I'd be interested.

The above DID appear as yellow text, standing out from the usual

    Robin, it is very problematic to imbed color directives
in plain-ASCII email.  Some mail readers can handle them and
some report them as gibberish.  Trying to do so is similar
to trying to imbed ANSI screen controls in messages.  Some
displays more or less roll over and die with such.  Better
to keep to plain text.

    There is a big problem here.  If Glosa is to be never more than
a written code, then these suggestions may work.  However, a SPOKEN
language CANNOT depend on written tricks such as capitalization,
punctuation, or other such graphical gimmicks.  (Recall that Arabic
script has no such distinction as upper- and lower-case letters and
therefore no such thing as capitalization.)  It is similar with
hyphens, doodads to mark "figurative" language, and so on (if any).
Is Glosa ever to be spoken or only written?

    Apart from some personal matters, my biggest problem has been a
consistent and optimized vocabulary.  I don't want to learn one
vacabulary and then have to revamp it.  As for the grammar, I think
it might be a good idea to have one in the background, so to speak,
but as I have mentioned before, I think an enhanced Mechanics of Glosa
might be adequate for those who just encounter the language for the
first time and might be put off by a dry grammar statement.  In that
sense, I can go with A&C's approach -- up to a point.

    The main thing that I see is inconsistent vocabulary lists which

I hope so! I've always considered Glosa to be a spoken language myself. This
is why it interests me so much. Many Manx speakers are now debating the way
in which dates and times should be represented. One of the suggestions is to
place the day first, then the month, then the year as in English, e.g.:
Jedoonee, yn chiaroo laa as feed, Toshiaght Arree,
nuy keead jeig kiar feed as nuy jeig.
(Sunday, the twenty-fourth day, January, nineteen hundred and ninety nine).

It is important, but not everything. Linux is catching on
in big engineering departments, on its true merits alone.
Microsoft will be stopped; I remember when it was "IBM and
the Seven Dwarfs", and they said to learn COBOL ...

Glosa has one thing no other has: pidginesque grammar. This is
the easiest for adults to learn, and that is the true market;
not the polyglots and first-language learners. If presented
properly (which requires a 100% complete product, not a beta)
then people will seize upon it as being FUN ...

Perhaps it is scary because you know it is incomplete.
A solid product needs no apology; Glosa is still "beta"
because it was a mostly amateur undertaking. However,
looking at history, it is clear that a "Lingua Franca"
can emerge among amateurs, and spread rapidly, and be
both fun and USEFUL. Such languages are pidgins, and
their properties are known: SVO word order, no morphology,
reduced vocabulary, mostly CV phonology, forgiving grammar.

> I am getting feedback that absorbing Glosa ^by osmosis^ is very hard to

I like Paul's grouped vocabulary; it is a winner.
It should be extended to the Glosa 2000+.
We could do something reminiscent of the Peano trick,
start talking about Glosa in English with a few examples
and then phase out English a bit at a time. Not just on
a web page, but here on the list(?).

A pidgin could go either way, head-initial for French-based
creoles is common. Either is equally good, but English
and Chinese are both head-final.

That part, I still don't see. "A pretty little girl" goes
"adj adj adj noun" in my mind, while dashing the "pretty-little"
changes it to "adj ADV-adj noun ... My way of thinking
is based on Jesperson's analysis of primary (= noun)
vs. secondary (= adjective) vs. tertiary (= adverb).
So in Glosa I'm thinking of noun phrases being basically like
"art adv-adj adv-adj ... noun", if that makes sense.

He said that English and Chinese were the most analytical, and
that seemed best. Bodmer's and Flesch's books supported this view.
Hogben wanted to jump ahead to where English was apparently
going, not to re-create it or stay with "Basic English".
Today, he would be comparing it to pidgins instead, because
English has become ever-more idiomatic, the bane of an IAL.

The best language is shocking and delighting, i.e. poetic.
But idiom is stale poetry, i.e. boring and bureaucratic.

The vocab and grammar need to be finished, then the fun part
of use and distribution could begin. Maybe the better way
to finish the vocabulary is to start translating stuff ... ?
I still think comparison of the Ido 4000 to Glosa 6000 shows that
Ido's is far better. Think of all the work that went into it,
Zamenhof through Jesperson. Borrow!

This was my way of ensuring that the grammar is complete;
it still seems to me to have major gaps. Relative clauses,
adverbial phrases, attachment ambiguities ... all can be
resolved in beta. Things like the semicolon punctuation
really don't work.

But it will never be 100% complete. Reach a critical mass,
maybe 98%, then shove off! June 1999?

     Neither Paul nor Charles, who are the most regular posters to this

I Have recieved only two other emails with these features: emboldening from
Robert Petry (Auxlang); and a word in colour from someone else.
     This embellishment has insignificant value in 1999 - and I guess will
only be worthwhile around 2005, when most present hardware and software
systems have been "heritaged".

    Copyright ticks, no, but you might work on a teaching method for Glosa

decided to send in my thoughts - to see how they check against yours.
.. Glosa as incomplete in several areas:
  - Standardisation of lexicon
  - Need for technical lexicons in all areas
  - Graded range of dictionaries of different lengths and complexity
  - Sound recordings of spoken Glosa
  - Range of literature in text form, also in FTP and on cassette
  - Business-wise publishing of Glosa literature and learning materials
  - Instruction on Glosa in all major natlangs
  - A range of self-instruction texts at different levels
  - "How to Teach Glosa" instruction for teachers at different levels
  - Sylabusses for purposes of course design and acreditation
  - An "Akademi" to foster, protect and develop Glosa
    ...... That's all I can think of for now ......
.. Basically its design is simply a pidgin:
  # Not bad: pidgins are pragmatic trading interlanguages.
  # I would have thought of it more like the creoles, which are more
'natural'.
  # The authors appear to have selected the pidgin-creole pattern
unconsciously, by simple genius.
  # The disadvantage is that pidgins are languages of necessity, made to
work despite difficulty in their introduction: while Glosa still has the
quality of difference from ethnic languages, few see any urgency
to learn it when they perceive no necessity to do so.
.. Little lee-way for creativity:
  % Poetry has been written in Glosa
  % I have translated some difficult passages on Conlang from Edmund
Grimly-Evans, and "The Wolf" on Glosalist, provided by Bill Patterson
  % Perhaps you refer to the turns of phrase, constructed differently from
those of the natlangs .. nrrding to be spelled out more descriptively
  % You most probably refer to the lexical derivatives formed through
addition of various affixes, or through inflection
  %% I believe that, with adoption, it will be decided that Glosa needs
conventions for the formation of derivative words, and these will be in
line with the way scientists now derive new terms by modifying the old.
  %~% Please give more details about the creativity shortfall in Glosa.
  ~%~ Also give English-language examples of texts that are likely to be
beyond Glosa's creative capacities.

    However, on the question of my motivation behind setting up the
Glosalist, some might be curious.  Originally, I took the Language Reform
concept seriously, when, in 1977 I Joined the Bahai Faith, and read what
Baha'u'llah said about the need for an International Auxiliary Language.
By a strange co-incidence, later that year, I met the authors of what was
then Euro-Glossa.
    I could see the basic pattern was sound, and had regular discussions
with Ronald Clark - while the language, 'Proto-Glosa', was still on the
drawing board.  I was drawn into the idea, and suggested that I could apply
my education background to furthering this social invention, which, in
starting so far behind the obvious front-runner, Esperanto, would need some
serious help if it was to close the gap.
    Numerous modifications to the language - and two decades - later, I
felt that creating a Net home of its own was the best way I could broaden
exposure to the Glosa concept.  A lot of work was needed, but, if I could
find others who would also appreciate the beauty of the design, the
fledgeling Glosa would soar higher than if I made my contribution in
isolation.
    Glosa might not seem ready for the coming global contest, just yet,
but with multiple tweaking from the Glosalist team, it can be ready to face
the "judges" sooner.

    I hope to see postings from others on this list, who might have been
fairly quiet up to now,  - pushing in the same direction Charles is doing -
"towards real usefulness."

    We are going to run up against this problem all the time in Glosa, when
it comes to matters where the fineness of division of categories almost
never ends.  Do we worry about people wering distictive items of clothing,
or are we going to be happy - in this age of survival - that people are
simply wearing "clothing"?  There are all manner of animals, and when it
comes to dogs, are we going to include all the breeds of dogs in the Glosa
dictionary?  Regarding common plants and animals, once we have all the
necessary functionwords and 'essential' substantives, there is room for
only a token collection of plant and animal names in a "Glosa 2.5K".
    Is there a valid policy that allows us to draw the line - the line
between the generic necessities, like "clothes" and "food", and specialist
items, such as a "wolf-skin fur coat" and "smoked salmon"?

*   Like you, Bill, I love words, and the power of discrimination they
give, but I wonder at what stage in someone's introduction to a new
language, they should be taught to make such fine distinctions as that
between the concepts of "hasty" and "swift".
    This question came to light when I was attempting to translate _The
Wolf_ into Glosa: the English-language original was full of what I would
call literary language, exploring the limits of the lexicon, even in
English.  While I enjoyed the challenge of doing this translation, I
realised that it was only of 'academic' interest, because many of the Glosa
words I found to give the particular nuances, would not have been in the
dictionaries of most Glosa-pe, and will not be in the proposed "2.5K Net
Dictionary".
    For the present, it seems that the concepts "hasty", "fast" and "swift"
might have to be rolled into one Glosa concept-word, IE ~tako~.
    Limitations on the length of the dictionary are of two types: an
ideological restriction suggests that Glosa is adequate for normal
communication with less words than other languages; and for learning
purposes, the shorter the dictionary the sooner one can master it.  In,
however, restricting the dictionary, we reduce the quality of
discrimination in the communication it allows: this explains my use of a
term like 'an optimal Glosa dictionary', not too long and not too short.
    So, I find the pressure to both optimise the dictionary and make it
adequately discriminatory, as well, has a ^having our cake, and eating it,
too^ quality about it.

*   Yes, this is an error on my part: ~metri~ [measure] and ~metra~
[metre], while both from the same Latin source, are quite distinct
concepts, and need different lexemes!
    The trans-Atlantic confusions in English, however, I cannot cope with,
and will stick to the Standard Oxford Dictionary: for me a "meter" is a
measuring machine, thus I would guess that "electricity meter" becomes, in
Glosa, ~elektro-metri-me~.

*   Yes I will agree with your idea of consistency - don't know now where I

are in the Glosa -> English section of _Glosa 6000_, ~litra~ is given in
the English -> Glosa section.

sovereigns and rulers, in general, I prefer - for beginners - the more
generic ~regi-an~, ~regi-do~, and ~regi-landa~ (or even ~regi-lo~ at a pinch).

*   Glosa does 'Generic Terms', which change the meaning of a word,
extending the lexicon EG -pe, -lo, -ze, etc.
    About a year ago, it was mooted that there might be a second list of
such affixes, and four letters in length seemed suitable; Paul Bartlett was
one calling for such an extension of the lexicon.  It seems obvious that
this innovation is necessary, to make Glosa more workable, when  people
wish to use more sophisticated terminology.
    KAPITALISMO is already in the dictionary, and it could be a compound
of KAPITALA and the -ISMO |abstract noun/principle| Generic Term affix.
So, the authors have used -ISMO, but have used to create a new lexeme
rather than to form a compound using hyphenation.

*   I agree that in this modern age, we need a much larger range of words
than is allowed, at present, by the pure lexemes, compounds of
substantives, and compounds made up from the eighteen, two-letter Generic
Term affixes.
    An -ISTI would be much more important than a -PE, and such a
distinction is necessary.  In principle, it would do the job, but, before
such an affix system was introduced, it would need to be related to the
existing heirarchy of words.  What affixes were needed, and, how they
related to existing category affixes within the natlangs, would have to be
worked out.

   This is just another job to add to the list.

Saluta,
 Robin G.

    This usage is in _Glosa 6000_ so "belong" is not really an omission.
    ~pertine~ [pertain to] = "belongs to" or "refers to"
    This is straight from the Latin dictionary, and points to a
relationship, often of ownership.

        X belongs to Y.

    I was foxed by the word: ~kamera~ is a primitive meaning "box"; a room
is a box (or boxed part of a house); and a photographic camera is a
mini-room with one window (lens) that lets light fall on the opposite
inside wall (sensetive plate).
  TEKA = "box"; MERO = "part"
  teKA'MERO -> KAMERA = (boxed part of house) "room"

    The Latin dictionary carries ..
       de-tego : to uncover, lay bare, unroof; to reveal, disclose.
    Without doing a search, I guess that ~heuresi~ with its awkward
difthong is derived from the Greek.  It is harder to pronounce, and a much
less known root and concept - in modern culture.  If 2.5K-wise, we can get
away with just one word for this area, I still favour ~detekti~.

    But then, I have not drilled myself to think this way, at speed.

    For Glosa, I do believe that, at the start, the structure of compounds needs to be shown - using hyphens - to show the joins.  I have also stated, before, that this could be a worthwhile ploy when using computers for the machine-handling of information - allowing the computer reader to identify each lexeme and affix.

    I found, in Gopsill, p212 "Affixes in Schematic and Natural Languages Compared", but this did not give me a full list of the Interlingua affixes: where can I find such a list?


    As someone born Pre-war, I still prefer to look up a book than download a file; where can I buy a book containing Interlingua's affixes?

Thinking out loud:

prep [art] adv-adj adv-adj ... noun
tense [art] adv-adv adv-adv ... verb

Could tense really be a type of prep, and adv-adv really be adv-adj, and verb
just be noun.
The blank prep means subject (no other prep can be elided, not even tense, else
it's just too confusing)..
The prep "??" means sometime/same time as before/time defined by adverb etc.
Usually don't have art after tense, but it is allowed.

I think these two would work. As I recall, there were quite a few -ISMO
and -ISTI words in which the "suffix" has the appropriate meaning, and
only a very few exceptions. I'll take another look at those exceptions
and see if they would really be too much of a problem.

Agreed! I think we can safely synonymize ~detekti~ and ~heuresi~, with
~detekti~ being the preferred word and ~heuresi~ a literary alternative.

    Again, how does one speak a semicolon?  More to the point, if 'ke'
merely tries to reproduce English 'that', we run into the semantic
overloading confusion of English in Glosa, hardly likely to endear
itself to those who do not already know English.

    There definitely should not be.  Time and again I become almost
dismayed at how Glosa becomes little more than recoded English, with
all the confusions of English for the non-native speaker.  We MUST not
smuggle English's monstrosities (which seem "natural" to us native
speakers) into a constructed auxlang.

    Not if it merely reproduces the semantic overloading of English.

    Credit must be given where it is due.  The idea is not original
with me.  Ashby&Clark have published in such a manner in some of their

which are repeated, for the most part, in categories.

If animal species constitute one of the top 100 "semantic fields",
and each field requires 100 terms, that fills the 10,000 CVCV words
defineable by a 5-vowel 20-consonant inventory ... Clothing, plants,
foods, shapes, etc are other obvious candidates. What I'd like to do
(if I could figure out how) would be to determine the fields first.
Then instead of a boring flat alphabetized dictionary, make a separate
"page" for each semantic field. The core vocabulary really depends
on what you are talking about; still, the Glosa 2500 is a step
in the right direction, just don't get too concerned about which
animals get into the ark.

Personally, I HATE derivational affixes ala Interlingua.
If they go over 2 or 3 letters in Glosa, I would not like them.

But going through these lists will expose any inadequacies

http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm

I've updated the dictionary files! Password, as before, is <password>.
The new dictionaries incorporate the previously omitted words, some
typo fixes, a few new words added for consistency, some more words
from Glosa 1000 that weren't included in Glosa 6000 for some reason,
and suggestions from the glosalist.

The Core dictionary now contains 2356 definitions, consisting of 1884
unique Glosa words. It would probably make a good base for the 2.5K!

I've also uploaded some sourcy files this time. My main source file
(ges.txt) can be found in source.zip; it has a few special formatting
character codes, like splats (*) in front of preferred synonyms, and
is the file from which all the dictionary files are generated by my
makefile.

Two intermediate files (egc.txt and gec.txt), which are themselves the
sources for the Glosa-English and the English-Glosa Core dictionaries,
can be found in core.zip; they contain the same data, one wordpair per
line, "lang1word = lang2word", but one is sorted by Glosa words and the
other by English words. They are the final step before the pageformatting
is performed for the Core dictionaries, and may be of use in creation of
the 2.5K.

Oops, I was afraid that would happen! I'll have to clarify a bit more
on that page.

There are five dictionaries, the GE, EGL,EGB, EGC and GEC, of descending
size and complexity, and these are the ones that have hyperlinks in the
left-hand column of the table. Each dictionary is available as a regular
zipfile and as a self-extracting DOS program; pick one or the other. So
that's ten files for the five dictionaries. But you only need to download
five files, the .zips *or* the .exes, to get all five.

The GE and (EGL or EGB) make a nice pair, as do the EGC and the GEC.

The extra files mentioned, SOURCE.ZIP and CORE.ZIP, are source files for
developers. SOURCE.ZIP contains the master source file (GES.TXT); CORE.ZIP
contains two intermediate files which are derived from GES.TXT and formatted
pagewise to create the EGC and GEC.

General comment... for printing, the five dictionary files are your best
bet. But for searching and such, you should probably get SOURCE.ZIP, one
big file with everything in it, one Glosa/English wordpair per line!

That's what I got. And I don't mean to criticize, but ...
It almost looks like it would be better as a tab-separated table.
Then, one could "sort +3 GES.TXT | ..." and such.
Also, it would be more easily importable into a SQL database.
But that isn't needed until there is more demand;
I can handle it with Perl scripts as-is.

Yep, and I've been known to pass files like this to tr or ex or vi
or sed to convert = to tab for further processing. I just never liked
tabs very much because you (usually) can't see them, and their effect
on output depends on the tab settings of the output device. So I rarely
use them. Except in makefiles because most makes require them. (And
then, to my surprise and disgust, I find that (by default) Reflection
FTP converts tabs to eight spaces in an ascii transfer. But that's a
whole 'nuther story!)

    Next question: after we agree, concensus-wise, on the best Glosa words
for the various omissions, how do we decide which of the omissions need to
go into the 2.5K Glosa Net Dictionary ... and when a number of English
words all point to one Glosa word, do we include most of these
thematically-related English words in the  Eng->Glo  sections of the "2.5K"
and "Ammended 6000" lists?

different forms of an exiting Glosa word, or synonyms for words that were
already covered in the Glosa dictionaries.

    This column comprised compounds and other forms derived from existing

    :New Forms:
    This column contains neologisms that were coined by me, almost
exclusively from the Latin dictionary.  This was as a last resort!

    All the time I was going through the Omissions List, I was aware of a
tension between the need to add a small number of essential words to the
Glosa lexicon, while intending, subsequently, to reduce the Glosa 6000 list
to something less than half its size: the two processes seemed to be moving
in opposite directions.
    However, I have done a first run through the 6000 list to 'cull' it,
and just have to complete the count to see if further 'culling' seems
necessary.

usages for this communication trio, but you may be moving into NewGlosa,

*   Not only is there a conflict in spelling - across the languages, "mile"

Glosa-pe in America - using miles.
    Perhaps when spoken, it is U.S.-MILE; maybe when written, it could be
MILE<A> to indicate that it is an Archaic term.  Or, if you persist in
using "miles" in the States, then we might have to borrow from the languge,
Java, which 'imports' objects.
    Maybe Glosa will have to allow for the "importing" of cross-cultural
words from other languages, EG MILE<Imp>, or MILE<USA:Imp> with the U.S.A.
transposed to being a prefix in spoken communication.
    Kilos are here to stay, but miles will be phased out, one day -
depending on the inertia of US culture.  So it looks as if we might need a
NewWord to correspond with the continuing use of the out-dated "mile" in
America.  Since this is a continent-specific problem, I suggest that
American Glosa-pe come up with an alternative for "mile" that suits them.

Okay, so I'll use HEKTO = "hundred" and CENTI = "hundredth", though I'm
not completely comfortable with this because "100" seems such a fundamental
thing, counting and such, and we'll be inconsistent with *all* the Glosa
dictionaries that I've seen. But... I *do* think it's the right thing to do,
and at least *we* will be internally consistent!

I agree. I've added NIMA and NIMA-BILETA, with NOMINA as the preferred
synonym for "name".

The 6000 also has RADIA = "radiate", so this would make the dictionary
more consistent trailing-vowel-wise. But the 6000 I have doesn't have
"radio" at all, and making RADIO = "radio" would be an inconsistency
relative to the 6000, which currently kind of lumps together RADIA and
RADIO, neither of which has anything to do with radios.

I like that. I'll put "trait" with KARAKTERA and "unit" with UNITA, which
does make more sense. UNITA = "unit" also fits better with other UNI-words.
Don't know where that UNITA = "trait" came from, but it's right there in
my 6000 though it doesn't really fit.

I'd favor just dropping "mile" since it's only of use in, what, two?
countries, I think. And as you say, probably won't be of any use some

Hey plu lojbanistani! Doesn't Lojban have a marker of some sort to show
that a word is borrowed from another language? We could have some such
marking word, possibly a generic, warning that the following word (or
phrase) may not mean what you might expect. Maybe this could handle
idioms too!

But I also noticed today that Glosa has no word for "thousandth". How
about MILI? Doesn't appear to conflict with anything else.

How to handle code-switching? ... It is common to use
change of pitch in speech, and italics or "scare quotes"
in print. I think this is much better than a morpheme.
Supra-segmentals always seem to get short shrift ...

"-" ... compounder
" " ... word break
"," ... phrase break
";" ... some strange noise in Glosa
"?",
"!",
"." ... all 3 as in Chinese

I like the usenet *asterisk* emphasis convention, very-high pitch.
Probably "a la mode" scare quotes for foreign phrases, slightly high.
Also (parenthetically) the voice-lowered parenthetical.
Print tends to short-shrift these essential intonation patterns.

    NIMA appears to be a truncated form of the Aeolic Greek dialectal
form 'onyma', which is found in words such as "synonym."  Why the
initial vowel was lopped off is a puzzlement to me.

    I would go with NOMINA myself, except that NIMA seems to be used

    An excellent point.  We have to beware of always trying to use the
English "is" with an adjective when 'habe' = "have" plus a substantive
will do just as well.  Nothing says that Glosa has to be a mirror image
of English.

    Sooner or later, we Yankees are going to have to join the rest of
the world.  Last I had ever heard, the only nations not officially

major world powers Liberia, Burma (Myanmar), and Bhutan.  Be it noted

    "Dinner" is problematic, and I recommend that it not be used to
render or explain any Glosa word.  Just within the US alone, "dinner"
is used in three different ways to designate meals, depending on what
region one is in.

Sooner I hope, than later. Being a physicist and then an engineer,
Metric is my system of choice, though I use that other system as
necessary. I agree completely, no sense in trying to cover all
measurement systems in space and time! I think I just ignored "mile"
in this most recent update, and I'll probably just leave it out
permanently unless anybody really really wants it included.

Time ... year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second.
Space ... meter, "astronomical unit", light-year, parsec.
Color ... what a mess.

Once I wrote a page description lang ala Postscript,
and defined a syntax allowing a number to specify its
unit, such as inch or pixel or fraction of page width,
e.g. 8.0i or 3200d ...

Now, I know about http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/sipm.html
but that is still only part of the answer, since it isn't
at all convenient to say e.g. .000023 or 4.123e27 amps.
I'm not sure what to do about it, other than just saying
23 millionths amps, etc. Is there a better way?

This shows some more realistic examples, for fun:

    Apart from the small contingent of certified Linguists calling
themselves "Interlinguists", I have seen no evidence of the existence of
"language planners" apart from the assemblage of 'amateurs' on Conlang,
Auxlang and Glosalist.  If there was a science of it, IE Design
Linguistics, then we might expect repeatable experiments, and a gradual
refining of the principles of Language Design.  No such luck.
    The Principles are there, waiting to be codified and classified; and
designs for Linguistics experiments, that would yield repeatable results,
must be somewhere, possibly scribbled on the backs of envelopes.
    As a recognisable group working with scientific rigour, I believe there
is no such thing as Language Planners.

    As I wrote once before, all the world can hope for, by way of Global
Language Reform, is something from the bunch of amateurs on the
Conlang-related Lists.  It's far too dodgey an area for venture capitalists
to risk their money, or Research Directors to risk their Doctoral students.
    And worse: there's far too strong a theme of altruism running through
the whole region of global communication; and researchers will never be
able to cash in on their Intellectual Capital.  But ...
    Aha! That's it.
    We tell Bill Gates that NuSpeak is the next big breakthrough, and
there's a buck in it for him.  If anyone can force people to upgrade their
grammar and vocabulary, it will be Bill.  I don't look forward to the
regular appearance of improved versions of the usage, and I know there will
be a price-tag attached; but, its marketting dynamism like Bill's that will
drag us screaming and kicking, and talking NuSpeak, into the next century.

Maybe,

*   Actually the incompleteness is not my main worry: I do know that some
more semantic post-fixes are needed to allow more modification of the words
- via hyphenated compounding; and special interest lexicons are needed, to
allow universal discussion in Glosa.
    The really scary part is that I have caught onto the way Glosa works,
but others do not seem to have clicked on: is this something to do with the
fact that I have put in a lot of effort into trying to understand the Glosa
formula; are others, who are interested in Glosa, not writing in it because
the effort needed to understand the system is too great?  I had imagined
that others, brighter than I, would have forged ahead with Glosa, long
before now.

>A solid product needs no apology; Glosa is still "beta"
>because it was a mostly amateur undertaking.
*   I know that the authors did everything by hand, allowing variety to
creep into the dictionaries.  However they did expect more people to take
it up and support them, by writing in it, and promoting it.
    They seriously miscalculated the available creative energy in the
world: they left numerous openings for creative people to step in, and
develop the language; some have produced dictionaries in other natlangs,
and small groups have set up in various places, but a strong central
co-ordination did not emerge.  The reason for this has been largely
financial; however, academic and political groups that might have taken it
up have not come forward.  Maybe this is yet another consequence of the
"beta" nature of the language: when we get it to the 98% mark, then
perhaps, academics will look at it.
    I would rather have written more children's stories in Glosa, while
others, more business-minded, helped with the promotion and dissemination
of the language.  However, this Glosalist has come from my initiative, in
the absence of enterprise from others.  I am searching, again, for those
creatives who have the vision to see Glosa's potential, and who are
prepared to play a part in this ^Civilisation Advance^.

*   True, and I am tipping that the Net community will be the first
significant group to develop the "leverage" necessary to seriously set
about solving the Language Problem.  It can be fun, but Glosa needs to
identify a meaningful area of endeavour, in which global dialogue,
though essential, is currently absent, and for which Glosa can provide the
missing medium of communication.  Weather change and weather control come
to mind, as possible areas for global discourse.

*   So Glosa has the magic "pidgin pattern", but still needs a level of
standardisation, and also needs a ^critical mass^ of users.  While pidgins
are easier to learn than most other languages, people still need a reason
for learning them, and I am getting the message, that "saving the world" is
not a strong enough reason for learning a language.
    Re the grammar, I imagine that an IAL needs a robust grammar, one that
delivers the goods despite rough handling.  This need, to permit the
transmission of meaning even with variations from the 'perfect', is a
dimension that I am trying to discover during the formulation of Glosa's
grammar.

*   Yes, but.  If this is Jesperson's analysis, it is, at best, parallel to
the way Glosa works.  The analysis of English grammar closest to that of
Glosa is Functional Grammar, which started with Halliday.
    The "adv-adj" before an English-language Noun translates into a
"modifier" before a Glosa Substantive: the Substantive at the Head of the
phrase might be a 'verb' or a 'noun', though this latter info comes, not
from the shape of the word, but from the position in the sentence of the
phrase that contains it.
    And while the "modifier is usually a word more prone to describing than
being described, it could also be a full Substantive, capable of funtioning
as 'noun', 'verb', or 'modifier': its role as 'modifier', however, is
defined by its position in the phrase; and, if a 'modifier' precedes
another 'modifier', then we can say it is modifying a 'modifier'.  This is
Jesperson's "adv-adj adv-adj" sequence, but such an analysis is too coarse
for Semantic Grammar, which takes over, where Syntactic Grammar leaves off.
 EG
  English:   THREE  BIG  GREEN  EAT  APPLE

   Glosa:    tri   mega  kloro  vora  pomi

   Of these two sequences, which can be used directly in a sentence?
   While you read the first, and wonder if it is part of an IQ test
quoted out of context; by the time you've finished reading the second,
you are imagining that you have sunk your teeth into one of them, and it's
tasting good.

   These two word-strings illustrate a number of points:-
    . the first needs an inflection (ING) and an agreement (S) before it
can form a Noun Phrase;
    . in both, the final word (APPLE, pomi) is the most obvious object;
    . EAT has the form of the infinitive verb, ~vora~ is a substantive;
    . while EAT APPLE might be an imperative, ~vora pomi~ suggests an
"eating apple";
    . ~tri pomi~ translates to "three apples" with no agreement needed;
    . GREEN EAT does not look like two adjectives in the middle of a NP,
while ~kloro vora~ before the final word of the first, or last, phrase in a
simple transitive Glosa sentence, is obviously a pair of
'modifiers', with the former modifying the latter, and the combined pair
modifying the Head of the Noun Phrase.

   Now I ask subscribers to re-arrange the order of the 'modifiers' in the
Glosa sequence: does it work?
   Magically, as if held in place by invisble elastic strands, the four
words before the Head tend to spring back into their original places,
despite attempts to force the phrase to make sense with a different sequence.
   The words before ~pomi~ are all attached to it, but with different
degrees of attachment: ~tri~ is held very loosely, having the strength of a
numerate determinant; with ~mega~, we have the fairly non-specific
indicator of proportion; next, with ~kloro~, we start getting a bit more
specific, there not being too many colours of apples; and, finally, with
~vora~ we arrive at the very spicific distinction in apples, between
"eating" and "cooking" varieties.
   So, somewhat long-windedly, I have demonstrated that the modifiers in a
Glosa Noun Phrase show "a proscribed sequence ... of 'increasing importance'".

   If I change one of the 'modifiers' in the sequence, and use the new

   - spelling tending towards phonetic;

   - simplification of vowel use;
   - metaphoric usage increasing allowing words to cross P-o-S boundaries.

    YES, it has been agreed that Glosa's ultra-numeric dating system needs
disambiguation between days, months and years, and ... also there
must be recognisable distinctions, between these categories, in both speech
and writing.

Just to recap., here is my thought on it, again:-

VERBOSE:-
  Spoken:   Di-septi, datu tri-mo, Meno-mo, Mo-nona-nona-nona

  Written:  Di-septi, datu 31 Meno-mo 1999

BRIEF:-
  Spoken:   Di-septi, tri-mo, Mo, Nona-nona

  Written:  Septi, 31 Mo 99
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no ambiguity in the above, unless, you don't observe,,, the
commas!  In my book, a comma represents a PAUSE, thus the following three
renditions of the "BRIEF Spoken" example would sound different:-

  Di-septi, tri-mo, Mo, Nona-nona

  Di-septi  tri-mo  Mo  Nona-nona *

  Di-septi-tri-mo-Mo-Nona-nona *

   And, if the un-starred version is read out (observing all commas, of
course) with 'falling vocal inflection', it sounds better, and more
natural, than if read out with level pitch.
   Please note: there will be Glosa versions of the date between the
Verbose and Brief forms, above; but, as long as they give sufficient
discrimination between the three, or four, component categories, then they
are functional, whether spoken or written.

    It is fascinating to think that the process we are going through, with

    I would be more understanding of your position, Paul, if you could give

does the same job better.

    My feelings are that the more 'naturalistic' an AL is, then the greater
appeal it will have to the largest number of people.  Hence I have been
following closely the discussions of pidgins and creoles on Auxlang: these
ad hok languages seem to have learnability and a slew of similar grammatic
features.
    Do we know about a worthwhile creole model for Glosa's Tense Particles?

*   OK, Knocking out two out of three ~pa~s leaves the whole responsibility
for pastness on the ~pa~ in the first clause.  And with a 'Perfective
Particle' in the penultimate clause, that leaves the setting of the time of
the action to just two particles.
    As I understand it, there is a question of "redundancy": possibly, over
that first ~pa~, a fly could get squashed onto the paper, as it did in the
film, "Brazil," causing the reader to lose the sense of pastness (and, in
the film, much worse).  I know real life doesn't ape art, but I am making a
point, here, about the possible need for a reminder, or two, on the timing
of the action.
    Also, there are those of us, with our psychological complexes, who
enjoy keeping our sentences in time, and feel cheated when we have to
stretch simple infinitives to cover a range of times.  Maybe there is
something comfortable and homey about being reminded about the tense, every
verb.

counter-productive, causing some to react against verbose usage.
    In the first sentence of the last paragraph, I used what might be

"Nonpunctual" corresponds to "completive" vs. "continuative".
Ido eventually needed to add a perfective -ab- and a passivizer
infix -es- to its verbal system, and I think Glosa needs them too.
Having a passive makes serial verb constructions easier,
and those are far more tractable than baroque prepositions.

I think that it is time for me to speak up a bit, though I tend to be

the advantage of resolving such problems as we shall undoubtedly see in
the years about to come of the meaning of 01/02/03.
I would therefore like to suggest that the "official" way of dating in
Glosa be in accordance with this standard, i.e., (YY)YY-MM-DD, with
whatever dividing marker [/,.- &c] we choose.  Other than that, terms MO
and DI can, of course be used.

    Glosa already has a passive construction, although there is some
disagreement as to what form it should take.  G.E.O. publications,
with which I agree, use the form 'es ge-X'.  If I have understood him
corectly, Robin plumps for the form 'gene ge-X,' using what I think is
a dangerously ambiguous counterpart of that English monstrosity "get."

    As for aspect particles, of course there are many aspects.  I have
favored a simple perfective and imperfective.  Glosa already has 'du'
for imperfective, and recently I brought up the issue of a perfective
aspect particle.  'No-du' would be technically correct, as the opposite
of 'du', but I do not like it.  However, so far I do not have a
solution within the already existing vocabulary source (which I want to
stay within as much as possible).

    By the way, Charles, I am curious as to whether you have ever
looked at my frater2 project:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/frater2.html

I did it more as an exercise in language specification rather than as
a complete IAL project (with a Hogbenish verb system), as I never
completed a vocabulary.  The vocabulary of the original FRATER was a
somewhat Glosa-like lexicon with a more limited phonemic inventory.

    For the time being, I have decided to get off my hobby horse about
redundant verb tense marking.  However, I do find it somewhat curious
that so many examples are in the past tense.  Whatever happened to the
present and the future?

    Tense and aspect are two different things.  It is only messy
languages like English which tense to squash them together.  My
understanding is that Russian, for instance, does a much better job of
keeping them distinguished.  Because tense and aspect are *not* the same
thing, I think that in a well-planned IAL, they should be kept separate
so that a speaker can use one without the other as needed and/or
appropriate.  (See also below.)

    Beside, why have only a past perfect?  Why not a future perfect, a
present perfect, a conditional perfect (which is even a worse mishmash
of tense, aspect, and mood), subjunctive and optative moods, and a
middle voice (as did classical Greek)?  Why not keep it simple and allow
a speaker to specify what s/he wants individually?  If you still think
you have to indicate both past tense and perfective aspect, why not just
specify them separately with distinct particles?  It is not as if we are
talking about some kind of burdensome apparatus here.  In my frater2
project, I kept tense and aspect separate.

    From my limited perspective, the English verb system is a mess,
even though as a native speaker I am accustomed to it.  I have_heard*
non-native adult learners really struggle with the complications of
English verbs, and they often get them "wrong" (and this structural
peculiarity completely apart apart from those lexical bastards, the
English phrasal verbs, which drive a lot of learners half bonkers).
I am basing my remarks on both structural grounds and the difficulties
I have experienced with English-as-a-Second-Language adult learners.
We native speakers can be deceived by our familiarity.

    As for examples, I am reluctant even to give examples from English,
it being the mess that it is.  But let us distinguish tense and aspect.
Tense for the most part expresses time reference, such as present, past,
or future.  Aspect, as my desk dictionary puts it, is "the nature of
the action of a verb as to its beginning, duration, completion, or
repetition and without reference to its position in time."  Tense and
aspect are separable notions.  Why combine them confusingly and
inconsistently in a single particle (inconsistently if one is going to
do it only for a single combination of tense and aspect)?  There are
many aspects one could mark, of course, but I think imperfective and
perfective would do for a language like Glosa.

    (* Here is one example from English I will use.  In this instance of
"have heard," it is called a "present perfect tense," but is is actually
more of an imperfective aspect with both past and present tenses, with
even an implication of futurity -- a real conglomeration!  It is
imperfective in aspect, because the hearing is actually something
ongoing.  It is past in tense but actually overlaps with the present
with an unspoken implication, being imperfective, that it could extend
into the future.)

>     My feelings are that the more 'naturalistic' an AL is, then the greater

    "Naturalistic" may be a decepttion.  If we are talking about an
auxlang intended for global use, what seems "natural" to speakers of
Indo-European languages (particularly, say, English or French) may seem
quite "unnatural" and even bizarre to speakers of other language
families, and vice versa.  We must not be led astray by comfortable
familiarity with our own native habits and assume that they are somehow
"natural" for all human beings.  Although I know I have posted it before
at least on AUXLANG, I will reproduce a short piece from a work of
fiction which may illustrate my point:

      Consider the following excerpt from David Eddings' fantasy novel,
  "Domes of Fire" (1992).  Eddings' fantasy series "The Elenium" and its
  sequel "The Tamuli" are set in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, medieval
  world with the common motifs of chivalry, magic, religion, and so on.
  Kalten is a brave and likable, but not always bright, Church Knight of
  Elenic language, race, and religion, and the Church Knights are trained
  to cast spells using the Styric tongue.  Sephrenia is a polyglot wisewoman
  of the Styric race.  In this episode, an Elenic party are in the Tamul
  Empire and need to learn to speak Tamul.  Incidentally, linguistic theory
  is not my point here.  My point is the misjudgment of considering that
  one's own language is somehow the "natural" way that all humans think.

          "Kalten, dear," [Sephrenia] said gently, why was I trying
        to teach you Styric?"
          "So that I could perform magic tricks, I guess."  He
        shrugged.  "That's unless you just enjoy making people
        suffer."
          "No, dear one.  It was just as painful for me as it was for
        you."  She shuddered.  "More painful, probably.  You _were_,
        in fact, trying to learn Styric so that you could work the
        spells, but in order to do that, you had to be able to _think_
        in Styric.  You can't just mouth the words and make them come
        off the way you want them to."
          "Wait a minute," he objected.  "Are you saying that people
        who speak other languages don't think the same way we do?"
          "They may think the same way, but they don't think in the
        same words."
          "Do you mean to say that we actually think in words?"
          "Of course we do.  What did you think thoughts were?"
          "I don't know.  But we're all human.  Wouldn't we all think
        in the same way and in the same language?"
          She blinked.  "And which language would that be, dear one?"
          "Elenic, naturally.  That's why foreigners aren't as clever
        as we are.  They have to stop and translate their thoughts from
        Elenic into that barbarian gabble they call language.  They do
        it just to be stubborn, of course."
          She stared at him suspiciously.  "You're actually serious,
        aren't you?"
          "Of course.  I thought everybody knew that's why Elenes are
        smarter than everybody else."  His face shone with blinding
        sincerity.
          "Oh, dear," she sighed in near despair,

    I do feel rather strongly about this issue.  I think that a planned
auxiliary language, unless it is deliberately designed to function
primarily in more or less one linguistic ambience, such as Interlingua,
should be very leery of importing too many peculiarities of a single
language or language family.

    It is also very English and may not seem "comfortable and homey" at
all to speakers of non-Indo-European languages.  We have to keep others
in mind as well if we want Glosa to have a shot at being a global
auxiliary.  But as I said, I will try not to keep harping on this
redundant-marking business, as long as others are permitted to do things
otherwise.

    I brought this up before.  We have 'du' as an imperfective particle
already.  Unfortunately I do not know of a good perfective particle
within the existing word stock.  As I mentioned, 'no-du' would be
technically correct in an Esperantic sort of fashion, but I don't really
like it.  As I also mentioned, some auxlangs use an adverb somewhat
counterpart to "already" to convey perfective notions, but "already" is
rendered by 'pre-nu', but 'nu' conveys too much presentness to my taste
when dealing with aspect.  So far I have not come up with anything.

    I just thought of an example which demonstrates the horrible
messiness of the English verb system.  (And the sentence happens
to be true in my own case. :-) )

I have been going to school recently.

In the school grammar that I learned, this would be called a "present
perfect progressive tense."  But such a thing is a monstrosity.  The
English progressive verb forms are more or less imperfective.  This
would make the verb a "perfective imperfective," which is nonsense,
even if it is acceptable English.  "I have gone to school recently"
would be a more or less perfective, implying that the going is pretty
much over.  I submit that such a mess should never be rendered into a
language like Glosa with a single verb phrase.

Mi pa du ki proxi-tem ad eduka-do e mi ki.

"I was going to school and I am still going."  If one really wanted
to emphasize the continuation of the going, one could, somewhat
redundantly, repeat the 'du' before the second instance of 'ki'.

If preceded by a TMA (tense-mode-aspect) particle, could it be
reduced to just "ge-xxx"? I agree, it was not well-designed.
In "standard" pidgins, TMA particles can all be dropped (which I
don't like ...) but in their absence, the opposite is assumed (IIUC).
So, leaving out "perfect" means "imperfect". I'd much rather have
and use the appropriate particle when desired, and default to nothing.
If nothing better turns up, "pra" is fine wiht me.
It ought to be a single CV syllable if possible.
In fact, I wish the whole project were more consistent
in keeping CV phonology, because it is easiest to learn.

I was very impressed by that, at least a year or 2 ago.
Very good work, both of you. Perhaps we should compare/contrast
some of its features with Glosa. For me, a touch of idealism
in the project is worth a lot (e.g. Zamenhof, vs. Couturat)
though I know you disagree.

Esperanto uses mandatory tense plus a sort of optional aspect
created by using tense a second time ... Ido is a little better
with its perfective infix. Best to clearly separate the functions.

Yes 100%.

As I keep saying on AUXLANG, an IAL is for L2 adults,
so any complexity or irregularity is unforgiveable.

See the many postings by Lee Sau Dan on sci.lang about Esperanto.
He goes nonlinear every time some Eo proponent talks about its
simplicity and regularity. Eo is as severe a downgrade from
Chinese grammar as Microsoft is from Unix ...

Ay, there's the rub:  there has to be some external reason for folks to
bother to learn any language, "natural" or "cooked up."
