I just can't stop thinking about those terminal vowels!

1. If the terminal vowel is used to mark part of speech, I think that this
makes the language easier to learn, to write and to read. But uglier, and
repetitive, because (generally) *all* words must be so marked. Less natural.

2. If it is not used to mark part of speech, then the language is harder
to write because you must memorize the correct endings; and harder to
read because you lose some indication of part of speech. But it is more
natural, and would probably make the language more comfortable to use
*in the long run*. And you can end words with a consonant.

Glosa has its own way of handling parts of speech, so it doesn't need POS
marking by terminal vowels. Indeed, the choice of terminal vowel is somewhat
arbitrary, determined by the designer's ear and consideration of words that
differ only in the final vowel.

If we removed/replaced all but one in each group of words that differ only
in the final vowel, we could once again allow users to use any vowel they
wish. Or, sometimes, none.

I like this freedom. I think it would result in a more beautiful language,
in a personalized kind of way - it would also be easier to learn because
it would decrease memorization - perhaps it would even sound better to
speakers of any particular language because they would be able to mold it
slightly towards the sounds of their own languages.

One advantage that most modern IALs have over Glosa is easy creation of
words and immediate recognition of their parts of speech, because the
final letters are fixed, have meaning, and the meaning is consistent.
In Glosa, the final letters are fixed but have no meaning or consistency.

Except for words that differ only in the final vowel, the final vowel is
totally arbitrary. So why not get rid of those problem words and then give
the user this flexibility?

It would certainly be different...

    Nor I.  I think the terminal vowel business is a pressing one for
Glosa.

    In different official G.E.O. publications we have "salta/salti" 
both meaning "jump/leap," whereas we have "seta" meaning "bristle" 
and "seti" meaning "seven."

    POS marking might also make it more difficulat to switch words among
parts of speech due to terminal-vowel collisions.

    Personally I do not favor this.  I think it would impede

Oooooohhh, yecch! As nostalgic as I get at times, that's one thing
I do *not* miss. I always liked typewriters because they made my

I like that idea. How did it turn out? Did any significant trends emerge?
I wonder if two of the words for 'snow' came from this period: nifa & nivi.

I confess that due to my Esperanto background I have to fight the tendency
to end nouns with -o and adjectives with -a. But I do like 'noktu'.

If there were no pairs of words that differed only in the terminal vowel,
then it wouldn't matter what terminal vowel was used; though a good choice
of terminal vowels might help differentiate words which would otherwise
sound too similar. Like the 'nifa' and 'nivi' I mentioned above, though
that's a pretty bad example because they *do* mean the same thing. But
'nif' and 'niv' would be harder to distinguish than, say, 'nifa' and 'nivi'.

What sort of guide for the selection of terminal vowels? Perhaps data
from the period of deregulation would be helpful here. What did people

I'm not sure I do either - I was thinking out loud again. But I was
thinking that POS marking can make the words easier to use, because
when writing you can predict how the word is going to end, and upon
reading you can deduce the POS. Also, POS marking via the terminating
letter is not *that* different from placing (but not attaching) a
particle before the word.

On the other hand, if the terminal vowel has no meaning, then the
language becomes *needlessly* more difficult if no other restriction
is placed upon the terminating vowel. And that's what the literature
demonstrates.

"18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa," 3rd edition, 1992, page 5:
    SC always pronounced like Eng. SH

"Glosa 1000 - English," 1994:
    SC as SH in SHow

*	Agreed, there are some beloved compound sounds that seem to have got lost
in the sift to make Glosa "one_letter_one_sound."

	We were fortunate that the Roman alphabet contained the C, K redundancy,
permitting the allocation of two different sounds to these letters.

	Originally, I thought that J and G had a similar relationship, but no.
The J instead of taking the 'soft G' position was allocated the european
*y* rather than the *dz* that might have been expected by English-speakers.
 This soft gutteral seems to have been lost completely from Glosa.

	And the *sh* that Bill mentions is a legitemate sound, that anyone might
want to make, but is absent from Glosa.  Bill's  SC  to render the *sh*
might be the best option for Glosa words that call out for this sound.
Even in the Glosa world, there will be onomatopea, so the option should be
open to render this sound into print.

	One hard/soft pair that is used less commonly, but is still in Glosa is 
S and Z.  I cannot think of any examples where a soft 's' has been rendered
into Glosa as a 'z', but perhaps there are cases where  Z  is more suitable
in a Glosa word than the  S  that might be suggested by the spelling of the
Latin source-word.
 
	Must close now: have not found time to look at Bill's list of words
needing Glosa equivalents, yet; nor have had a chance to follow up the
basic word list idea suggested by Paul Bartlett.  Is anyone else on this
list interested on working on the dictionary lists?

*	In Glosa it is a very complex situation ... where the "sing-song"
qualities of the C-V couplet results in most words ending in a vowel.  But
the question remains, which one, and is it important?
	In English, on the other hand, most words do not end in a vowel, and there
are not many P-o-S markers around, either.

*	Memorisation:  no double letters; few vowel pairs; no rules for adding
inflections; no P-o-S differentiations to worry about; say a word to
yourself ten times, and the feel of the terminal vowel will be
internalised; only one spelling per word.
	Reading difficulty: one must read for grammar in Glosa; the syntax is the
grammar; and the syntax (well puntuated, in text; and well inflected, in
speech) clerly indicates a word's function.
	As the language matures: yes, ease of speaking and ease of listening are
the long-term considerations of importance; and the option of having
consonant- terminal words, plus the option of clipping vowels before
vowel-initial words, adds to flexibility and poetry.  Poetry and a
comfortable 'feel' are the qualities that should, I feel, emerge triumphant.

*	Agreed, ear comes into it: an ugly-sounding Classical root should not
retain its awkward sound just to remain consistent with its historical usage.
However, if there is a rule running through all of this final vowel
business, I think it should be related to the original Classical
pronunciation (and spelling).

>If we removed/replaced all but one in each group of words that differ only
>in the final vowel, we could once again allow users to use any vowel they

*	This is a statement in favour of poetry.  Sadly, I suspect that the man
and woman in the street are not yet ready for this level of freedom; also,
I don't know what the speed-reading people or the Dyslexia psychologists
would say about the effect on our brains, of this sort of irregularity in
the reading process.
	But even more damaging to Glosa would be the plethora of different
dictionaries that would be printed, each with its own preferred spellings;
then there would be serious opposition from the regiments of
authoritarian-minded primary school teachers; and there would also be
complaints from the left-
hemisphere dominant school-children, who really do want a word to be spelt
the same way every time.
	The very small minority of Glosa words that differ only in their terminal
vowels, or, as you point to the possibility, the lack of them, these could
have a special rule struck, and few would be the wiser.

*	Again, I like it; but it is the poet's point of view; and, as such, will
be a minority one.  Chinese would get away with it, and probably has, for
centuries.  In Chinese, a more musical final inflection would be
appreciated and perpetuated by listeners, and would not upset the writing
system.  However, in Glosa, as in English, there is a necessary
correspondence between written and spoken forms of the words.
Dictionary-writers, appointed representatives at the U.N., and Elected
Euro-M.P.s are all likely to expect 'standardisation' in the new world
language that they correspondingly publish and vote for. 
	With the IAL, we will have global radio and much more international
telephone traffic: this all depends on the language being heard correctly.
I fear that flexible terminal vowels will cause friction within these
sound-based
media.

*	Agreed, many languages use inflections for semantic change, and Paul
Bartlett forshadowed a change to the (hyphenated) generic affixes, with the
creation of a class of longer semantic affixes, EG -abili.
	As a possible dimention of meaning, the final vowel does offer an
opportunity, but this chance of having Part-of-Speech markers or some sort
of regional or mood colourings indicated by a change in the terminal vowel,
seem to be lost in favour of rigidification of the the lexicon ... perhaps
to aid the machine handling of information.  My belief, as a keen follower
of the fortunes of Bill Gates, is that regular spelling is a better
"marketting" ploy for Glosa than stressing the language's poetic qualities.

>Except for words that differ only in the final vowel, the final vowel is

*	As I have tried to point out, the final vowel is not arbitrary, but
derived from the Classical root, and, where selection became necessary,
chosen for the most suitable pronunciation.
	I do believe that 'the user' is not ready for such "choice" even though
this is a buzz-word among the hyper-capitalists, at present.  Musicians and
artists, as well as poets would be able to creatively 'play' with the
terminal vowels, but the average person would, I fear, simply see it as a
licence for sloppiness in spelling, and would use the first vowel that
popped into their head, quite uncreatively.

Interesting point. I hadn't really thought too much about the semicolon,
though I agree: it always seems to *stop* me more than seems necessary.
I always figured that this was just me, a cultural thing. But no language
comes to mind which uses the semicolon in this fashion, and those that
come to mind while thinking these thoughts all use the semicolon in pretty
much the same nonglosa way. Robin, has there been any research into this
issue? How are semicolons used around the world? Has this been a problem
for those whose native language is not English? How about using a space-
delimited hyphen instead. (That's one use of hyphens that I like.) Some
samples, lifted from the Glosa Basic reference...

Here I use a comma instead of a semicolon, still punctuating, but not as
forcefully:

   The man who ...
   Glosa: U andro; qi ...
   Me:    U andro, qi ...

Here are some examples that really stop me too much, with my alternatives:

   She was singing; when he came.
   Glosa: Fe pa du kanta; kron an pa veni.
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta, kron an pa veni.         # comma instead
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an pa veni.          # is it even necessary?
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an veni.             # too much pa?

   The woman; who is going round the corner; is my neighbor.
   Glosa: U gina; qi ki peri gono; es me para-fe.
   Me:    U gina, qi ki peri gono, es me para-fe.  # how I'd probably do it
   Me:    U gina (qi ki peri gono) es me para-fe.  # shows the nesting
   Me:    U gina - qi ki peri gono - es me para-fe.

An important difference between those two examples is that one phrase
follows the other in the first example, while one phrase is nested within
the other in the second example. The more straightforward first example
doesn't need as much punctuation for clarity.

From the Glosa Basic Reference, we have...

GBR> 1. Colon precedes items of a list;
GBR> 2. Comma separates list items from each other; it also occurs
GBR>    after a vocative expression.
GBR> 3. Semicolon separates principal and subordinate clauses;
GBR>    a clause is a group of words containing a finite verb.
GBR> 4. Hyphen joins words closely associated semantically.

I dislike hyphens. In 'email' too. In true hacker fashion, I ram words
together without hyphens, or choose different words that won't need
hyphens. Never liked underscores either, and will not use them unless
forced. They're just blank wannabees, and filenames shouldn't have
blanks in them anyway. What was my point? Oh, yeah, the hyphens do make
Glosa easier to read. But I suspect that as Glosa becomes more widespread,
they will disappear. Unless, and here's the big UNLESS: unless the absence
of hyphens causes major parsing headaches. Compound words are created in
Esperanto much as they are in Glosa, but Esperanto doesn't (usually) need
hyphens, because except for a few famous examples, individual elements of
Esperanto compounds are readily recognizable, and the compounds can only
be parsed in one way. This is probably not true of Glosa.

But then, I must confess that I've never let the rules tell *me* how to
punctuate English, and I'm proud to say that (despite what my teachers
believed) the world has finally, in some ways, come to agree with me. My
style has evolved over the years as an interaction between logic, human
languages, and computer languages. (<-- See that extra comma over there?

Interesting point. I hadn't really thought too much about the semicolon,
though I agree: it always seems to *stop* me more than seems necessary.
I always figured that this was just me, a cultural thing. But no language
comes to mind which uses the semicolon in this fashion, and those that
come to mind while thinking these thoughts all use the semicolon in pretty
much the same nonglosa way. Robin, has there been any research into this
issue? How are semicolons used around the world? Has this been a problem
for those whose native language is not English? How about using a space-
delimited hyphen instead. (That's one use of hyphens that I like.) Some
samples, lifted from the Glosa Basic reference...

Here I use a comma instead of a semicolon, still punctuating, but not as
forcefully:

   The man who ...
   Glosa: U andro; qi ...
   Me:    U andro, qi ...

Here are some examples that really stop me too much, with my alternatives:

   She was singing; when he came.
   Glosa: Fe pa du kanta; kron an pa veni.
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta, kron an pa veni.         # comma instead
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an pa veni.          # is it even necessary?
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an veni.             # too much pa?

   The woman; who is going round the corner; is my neighbor.
   Glosa: U gina; qi ki peri gono; es me para-fe.
   Me:    U gina, qi ki peri gono, es me para-fe.  # how I'd probably do it
   Me:    U gina (qi ki peri gono) es me para-fe.  # shows the nesting
   Me:    U gina - qi ki peri gono - es me para-fe.

An important difference between those two examples is that one phrase
follows the other in the first example, while one phrase is nested within
the other in the second example. The more straightforward first example
doesn't need as much punctuation for clarity.

I dislike hyphens. In 'email' too. In true hacker fashion, I ram words
together without hyphens, or choose different words that won't need
hyphens. Never liked underscores either, and will not use them unless
forced. They're just blank wannabees, and filenames shouldn't have
blanks in them anyway. What was my point? Oh, yeah, the hyphens do make
Glosa easier to read. But I suspect that as Glosa becomes more widespread,
they will disappear. Unless, and here's the big UNLESS: unless the absence
of hyphens causes major parsing headaches. Compound words are created in
Esperanto much as they are in Glosa, but Esperanto doesn't (usually) need
hyphens, because except for a few famous examples, individual elements of
Esperanto compounds are readily recognizable, and the compounds can only
be parsed in one way. This is probably not true of Glosa.

But then, I must confess that I've never let the rules tell *me* how to
punctuate English, and I'm proud to say that (despite what my teachers
believed) the world has finally, in some ways, come to agree with me. My
style has evolved over the years as an interaction between logic, human
languages, and computer languages. (<-- See that extra comma over there?

Hello Glosalisters, All Eight of Us,
	It is a bit windy up here on the pinnicle, with so few of us about: maybe
we will grow in numbers, soon.
	Here is a conundrum that was forshadowed by Paul Bartlett: Jerzy
Wroblewski, from Poland, enquired of the Glosa authors how he could learn
Glosa, and he was sent my contact details.  The short letter I recieved, in
Esperanto - and amazingly easy-to-read Esperanto, at that - announced that
he was a 48 year old engineer, who already corresponds with people in
Esperanto and Ido (his hobby being linguistics), and who wants to learn
Glosa, and give it a whirl, as well.
	I publish both my replies to Jerzy - in Glosa and English - here on the
Glosalist for your information and comment, but primarily to ask for help
on the question of crossing linguistic boundaries ... even at the rarified
atmosphere of Planned Language, and even if with the help of Glosa's
standardised form.

	I plan to jump in with both feet, writing directly to him in Glosa, but
backing up with a ^safety net^ English translation.  He says about English,
that, while he recieved information from Richmond about Glosa,
unfortunately it was in English, and, " ... bedaurinde mia angla lingvo
estas malbona."
	So, either we have a linguistic ^Mexican stand-off^ or Jerzy will read my
Glosa through sheer force of will; and, together, we will have
^sledgehammered^ through the language barrier.

	Any suggestions from the panel!?  I will type Jerzy's letter and publish
it here if people request it.  Can anyone tell me what he actually does at
work, if he reports, " ... mi laboras kiel gvidanto de 
brandfarejo."
	After previous complaints about the non-transmission of "Attachments", I
hesitate to add my letters in the form of an attacment file, but trust that
the improvements to the Net, people's email software, and my Eudora
"Options" all 'harmonise' to produce perfect
transmission of my Jerzy letter to your computer screens.
	The main reason for choosing the ASCII, "Galaxy" word processor to prepare
Jerzy's letter is the infinitely beter formatting qualities of Galaxy over
Eudora.  However, I have squeezed the line length in to 63 characters in
width, and have filled most of the 'white space' with dots - to preserve
the formatting - so hope that you see POLANDJW.ATT on your screen as I saw
it, on mine, before transmission.
	While I suspect that we have no writers of Polish among us, I know we have
Esperantists and Idists.  So, I will put Jerzy's address in here, with the
reminder that he did ask about Glosa, and a plea for others who might wish
to communicate with him, to use more or less "standard" Glosa in their
communications ... not giving the impression that the language is changing
at a rate greater than that of 'normal' linguistic drift.
 Jerzy Wroblewski
 21-305 Suchowola 
 Pollando (Don't forget to mention that "Rob sent you.")

	I have my fingers crossed that he has a DOS computer, and that I can send
him a disk of the "Experimental Dictionaries" to speed up his use of the
vocabulary.  If so, I will send a slimmed down version of the English to
Glosa (6000) file with nothing over two synonyms.
	I am not sure if I overdid my first letter, and whether it is too long,
far too long, or O.K.  Comments please.

	Meanwhile, I am not expecting a torrent of Glosa letters through
Jerzy's letterbox, considering comments on this list, and elsewhere, that
Glosa is not easy to handle.  However, I trust that this - Attached -
letter in Glosa and English will encourage some to see Glosa as reasonably
'cool'.  I did, of course, do the sensible thing, and write the original in
Glosa, translating from this into English.  I do find that a lifetime of
sloppy methods and unconscious elision, combined with a much larger working
vocabulary of literal and non-literal language, makes translation from
English to Glosa sometimes quite painful.
	That's about it, so over and out.
Saluta,
 Robin

    I am a bit pressed for time for several days, but I did want to
make just a few words of reply to Robin's notice of a Polish inquirer
into Glosa.

    Any conIAL, if it is likely to go very far, is going to have to
have materials available in various natlangs.  The Esperantists and
Interlinguaists are way out in front on this, and I think the Idists 
on the net are trying to catch up.  After all, we cannot expect all
inquirers to first know English or French or whatever.  That sort of
obviates the purpose of a true IAL, if people first have to learn some
other language in order to learn the IAL.  Unfortunately, I have no
Polish, and my Esperanto is a little weak without a lot of dictionary
use.  (In a pinch I might be able to put something together crudely in
Esperanto, and I can print the accented letters correctly.  I wouldn't
want to try it in Ido, and I don't have a very good Ido dictionary,
anyway.)

    I make this as "I work as a guide in a distillery"  (brand/o =
"schnapps, brandy; spirits").

    Is this a complete postal address?  I don't know Polish addresses,
but there doesn't seem to be anything like a street number in it.

    In one of the letters, Robin mentioned that he prefers to use Glosa
6000.  I'm not sure I can entirely support this, especially with a new
inquirer.  One of the "selling points" of Glosa is that it is supposed
to make do for basic communication with a modest vocabulary.  My real
complaint all along has been that so-called Glosa 1000 is not quite up
to the job but that a better-selected and perhaps only slightly larger
list might do it.  I think that "6000" is a bit of overkill for the
basic purposes of Glosa.  I opine that all it really needs is a better
"Glosa 1500" or "Glosa 1800" or something like that.  (I haven't
counted exactly, but I think that the Basic Reference on my web pages
has about 1600 words.  That might be a good place to start.  If need
be, I can chop it apart into a better plain ASCII text.)

    Good idea.

    Yes.  We native speakers of English do tend to be rather sloppy, I
would say, and this sloppiness and ellipticism can carry over into our
auxlang usage -- Glosa or otherwise.

    All I have time for now.

*	Interesting, I thought, when I was first told, by the Glosa authors, that
a semicolon was used in specific, and different, ways in that language. 	It
was then that I started observing my own use of the semicolon in English,
and wondering if there really was a need for this 'heavy' comma in Glosa,
and if there was possibly a sililar function for it in English.
	Although it is qualitatively different from them, I see the semicolon as
'roughly' between the comma and colon in strength.  With this germ of an
idea I started thinking about the way I joined sentences using the comma ..
instead of an "and."  I found that, in some sentences, I wanted it both
ways: I wanted both the comma and the "and."  You guessed it: a new use for
the semicolon was invented .. 

EG  " ... decided to hide in the bushes; and, while crouched down, there .. "

	This English language usage, naturally enough, transferred over to Glosa
use, as well.  For all I know this 'heavy join' involving both the
semicolon and "and" may be something I picked up in my reading; but, there
seemed a functional case for it.

	Aside aside, I did ponder the functionality of using the semicolon in
Glosa, also.  What rose to consciousness was as follows: Glosa having no
P-o-S markers and no verb inflections, is clarified (gramaticised) in
speech through the normal use of vocal inflection and pauses - to indicate
structure, both phrasal and clausal; however, in it's written form, with
these vocal grammatical effects absent, Glosa needs a strong punctuation to
indicate its sentence structure.
	My guess is that the Glosa authors saw the semicolon sitting there,
somewhat underused, and decided that it was ^just the ticket^ to act as a
clause-marker in Glosa.  Although I considered it as 'brackets' around a
clause, I decided that this was too heavy, altogether, and compromised to
using the semicolon as a 'flag,' at the start of a new clause, placing a comma
at the exit end, where the clause might lead into a phrase.

EG 
 The boys, who are going to the river to catch fish, carry their long rods.

 Plu ju-an; qi du ki ad u fluvi, te kapti plu piski, fero mu plu longi baci.

 Plu ju-an; qi du ki ad u fluvi, te kapti plu piski; fero mu plu longi baci.*

EG
 Three girls, who clothed themselves in thick coats, and who also wore
boots, came in from the snow.

 Tri ju-fe; qi pa vesti mu-auto in paki tegu; e qi pa pluso habe epi mu plu
alti pedi-ve, pa veni in, ex u nivi.

 Tri ju-fe; qi pa vesti mu-auto in paki tegu, e qi pa pluso habe epi mu plu
alti pedi-ve, pa veni in, ex u nivi.* 

>     [  .....................  ]  
>   Robin, has there been any research into this issue? 
*	Well no and yes.  There has been NO establishment research interest in
Glosa: the normal response is that after we get the language up and
running, and when there is a sizable community of users, then the Academics
might notice Glosa's existence.  In realworld terms, Ron and Wendy ARE the
research.
They are, of course, using the "Intuitive" method, rather than one based on
a series of comparative trials using armies of experimental subjects.  This
approach to Glosa's development - a combination of being ignored by paid
researchers, and the ^hand to mouth^ economics of the authors - forces
those working on the language to use their material and intellectual
resources extremely efficiently.
	Can I say that the Glosalist is a part of the Glosa research effort?

>How are semicolons used around the world?
*	Firstly, I don't know.  But, as Glosa is supposed to be presented as a
'language for all' maybe I should worry about this.  However, since the
sentence structure of Glosa is based on that of English, I question whether
we have to go beyond studying English usage.  Considering that English is
being learnt by so many people, and I have not, as yet, heard complaints
from learners, about the punctuation of English, it seems that punctuation
in English (and Glosa) can be accepted as a 'given.'

>     Has this been a problem
>for those whose native language is not English? 
*	This is an excellent question; and, now that I have started writing again
to the only community actively learning Glosa, it is one that should be
raised with them.  In the past, the authors wished to avoid anyone's being
pedantic over grammatical rules, for fear of their frightening off the
unpaid, volunteer experimental subjects.  I would rather co-opt people into
the continuing development of Glosa than ask them, directly, about problems
they are having with the language.

*	Well, the  '-; qi -' suggestion for introducing adjectival clauses in
Glosa, has not worried me; I see it iconically, as a convention.  But, the
semicolon is undeniably ugly: not rounded like a colon, nor neat like a comma.
Its advantages are its presence on the keyboard, and the logic of : > ; > ,
	I am not too sure why the authors saw the need to place the semicolon
before adjectival clauses, but it could just be a ready example of their
perceived need for stronger clause marking in a language with syntax-based
grammar.  In English, the comma does double duty as a divider - between
both clauses and phrases: perhaps there is a case, in Glosa, for a
distinction between such dividers; maybe it is only necessary to denote the
start of a clause - to ensure clarity of understanding.  One value of the
semicolon, however, is that it is a neat marker of elision.

EG
 The man, who was walking along the street, turned into the shop.

 Un andra; qi pa du greso longi u via, pa tropi in u boteka.

+
 The man; walking along the street, turned into the shop.

 Un andra; du greso longi u via, pa tropi in u boteka.

>D.   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an veni.             # too much pa?
>
*	Agreed, this semicolon in A. feels like overkill.  The difference between
B. and C. might depend on the writer's desire for the reader to sense a
stress on "kanta" or a rising vocal inflection at the start of "kron": are
we stressing that she was singing, or that he came?  Such questions of
nuance are more in the area of poetry than rule-based grammar.  Was she
singing because he came, or was she singing when he opened the door?
	Getting back to Glosa being a 'language for all': those who are
rule-driven, will want to have a regular pattern for sentence formation;
while poets will break the "rules" creatively to communicate their
particular jist;
and those in the middle will appreciate having some guides to help them
form meaningful sentences, while retaining the right to step outside these
guides, as it suits them.
	The authors want Glosa to be both regularised for pedestrian
communicators, and flexible enough to allow the poet his creativity.  This
is a hard line to follow, and also a hard rule to propound.  As I see it,
the language is now in the phase of having had its guidelines drawn up,
with users of Glosa discovering the way they can make these guidelines work
for them.
	In reality, the language is still 'floating', with the ultimate usage in
the hands - and mouths and minds - of the Glosa-pe. 
	D. is correct if it adequately conveys the intended meaning.

*	The nesting in G. and H. seems unduly mathematical, and I prefer to use
hyphens, as in H., in both English and Glosa, for a different stylistic
function than I use commas.  Agreed, F. is natural, and I like it; but I
see no loss - and a possible gain - in using semicolons to introduce clauses.
 I.   Rob:    U gina; qi du ki peri u gono, es mi para-fe.
 J.   Rob^:   U gina; ki peri gono, es mi para-fe.  (HIGHLY ELIDED)

*	Quite so, the hyphen is the traditional way of forming compounds, that
preserve the integrity of their constituent parts.  In CyberSpace we do it
differently, and do not suffer Paul's worry about the pronunciation of an
intruded symbol; we also know that computers are bright enough to pick up
the medial capital, and recognise it as the initial marker of a component
word.
	And lo!  The first initial of a compound could be the 'flag' that heralds
the start of a combination word.  BlowMeDown, I could use PartOfSpeech
instead of the traditionally, hyphenated "Part-of-Speech."  E in Glosa id
sio es "MeroDeDice."  Both hyphenated and capitalised versions sound the
same as the apostrophe-marked, twee version, 'mero de dice'; however, the
computer will find either of the hyphenated or capitalised forms more
readable and interpretable than the looser, apostrophe-marked one!

>    Unless, and here's the big UNLESS: unless the absence
>of hyphens causes major parsing headaches.
*	Ahh!  AI, and all that.  It is my ^gut reaction^ that Glosa is one of the
most readily parsable of languages.  Sadly, I am no programmer, and I
cannot find a programmer weird enough to want to look at Glosa from the
MeaningRepresentationSystem viewpoint.  The programmers I have met, so far,
are too logical to risk wasting their time on a language that might end up
getting out-marketted by something with a faster-talking SalesManagement.

*	Not being drawn into the internicines, I would tend to agree that Glosa
compounds, being uninflected, could be harder to decipher than Esperanto
ones; however, a merodedice in Glosa, comprising smaller words, stands out
instantly as being odd, and would automatically be treated to a ^lower
gear^ mentally, to allow it to be interpreted.  Sadly, for me, a lot of
normal, non-compound words, in Esperanto, look odd.

*	Being system-creators rather than rule-followers is one of the main
qualifiers for earning our "Conlang" ticket.  And, yes, the presence or
absence of that final comma should be more a question of 'feel' rather than
of Linguistic Lore.

*	Very interesting!  The Richmond genii have not mentioned anything about
reported speech, and whether to comma or not, or whether to double dot or

punctuation as a literary convention.  However, with elision in the air,

sentences with a pre-final dot.  Somehow I feel that the sacredness of the

dot.

Interesting. I just checked my old "The Office Encyclopedia" (I love
library booksales!) for its comments concerning semicolons. And in every
example they gave, you could have replaced the semicolon with a period,
and the resulting sentences were proper sentences all by themselves. It
seems to just be a way of coupling complete standalone sentences together
more closely, as you found...

Maybe that's why the Glosa semicolons stop me too much. Or perhaps it's
because in C, which I use every day, semicolons are used to terminate a
statement!

That usage probably became necessary when the English pedants took away our
right to begin sentences with "And" and "But", a perfectly legal Old/Middle
English way of writing, which I use often.

Oooooh! How about using hats, as in ^just the ticket^? Though I guess it

after a while.

If you've got the QI you don't really need the semicolon before, though

Hey, I'm weird enough!

Tee hee! But I didn't mean just computer-parsable, but-human parsable too.
A classic Esperanto example is 'sakstrato' - is it sak/strato or saks/trato?
Completely different things, both valid. The context should help, but still...

I'd say they're sufficient, creating just another object to be manipulated
in the sentence. Depending on the learner's natlang, it may appear that
something's missing. But structurally, there should be no difference between
"He ate X" and "He said X".

I believe Glosa would be significantly improved if false friends, especially
critical (eg personal pronoun) ones, were removed.  Glosa probably has very
few false friends (it's one of the design goals of an IAL), and the only ones
I'm aware of are "vi" (Swedish Vi = We, Dutch Wij = We) and maybe "ne" (Greek
Nai = Yes).

    I have never thought of 'vi' as a false friend.  It never even
occurred to me that anyone might consider it such.  To be sure, the
form is not strictly Greek or Latin as such, but Latin forms of the
second person plural pronoun usually begin with "v", as do many of 
the descendant personal pronouns in Romance languages.

    False friends may be an almost unsolvable problem if an IAL is
intended for use around the world, and not just by west-European
speakers.  There are so many human languages which do things so many
different ways that I consider the problem of false friends for
*somebody* to be almost inevitable.  Why should speakers of Romance and
Germanic speakers be exempted from false friends when speakers of other
languages then might have to suffer through them?

    Even if a conIAL had a vocabulary made up essentially randomly of
pronounceable combinations of sounds, there would still be the risk of
false friends for somebody.  To try to comb through the however-many-
thousand languages in this world to eliminate every potential false
friend I consider undoable in practice.

    Another thought that occurs to me as a take-off from Aaron's post.

    A good point.  Just what does "officially" mean with respect to
Glosa?  The Glosa Education Organization, which seems to consist of Ron
Clark and Wendy Ashby, so far as I know, holds copyright to Glosa
publications.  When I put up the official Glosa world wide web pages, I
was careful to include only material from their publications and to
include copyright notices.  (The "front" page is my own description and
does not include copyrighted material.)

    Rhetorically, do only Clark and Ashby have the right to make any
changes?  Johann Schleyer insisted that only he had the right to
approve any changes to Volapük, and this attitude may have contributed
to its more or less demise.  Leslie Jones allowed people to _use_ his
Eurolengo but would not allow any changes in the language itself -- at
least, that's the way I interpreted things (going from memory, and not
that Eurolengo went anywhere, anyway).

    Ashby and Clark do not even participate in this forum of Glosalist,
and I have no idea whether they are even aware of what does on here. 
Undoubtedly there are some people who are already using Glosa to some
extent who do not use the Internet.  How and by whom can Glosa change, 
if at all?

    One point, in my estimation, needs to be made.  Many authors -- and
sometimes users -- of constructed auxiliary languages seem to want to
tinker them to death.  I think that this is unwise, as the sands are
always shifting under one's feet.  Although many non-Esperantists decry
the action, I personally think that the declaration of of the
"netushebleco" of the "Fundamento de Esperanto" is the best thing that
ever happened to that language.  IALA Interlingua has a solid base in
the Interlingua-English Dictionary and the Gode&Blair Grammar.  Lojban
has been "baselined" for five years.

    For a time I thought that Glosa was in an unsatisfactory state.  I
have ameliorated my position somewhat.  I still think that the
presentation is inadequate, but that is just that, presentation, and
not the language itself.  Also, I think that the selection of the base
vocabulary of "Glosa 1000" -- which seems not to exist consistently --
is partially infelicitous.  However, I do think that there is adequate
material in Glosa 6000 from which a better selection could be made.

    At present, all I think Glosa really needs is a better selection of
base vocabulary from already existing material and better presentation
in more languages.  I am not in favor of using Glosa 6000 wholesale, as
that seems to negate the advantage of a relatively small vocabulary to
be learned.  I advocate just a better selection of a "Glosa 1600" or
whatever.  I do not think that extensive tinkering with the language is
wise.  The basic structure of the language is more or less workable, in
my opinion.

    There has been a running disagreement on the AUXLANG list between
those -- such as myself -- who think that "good enough is good enough"
and those who quest for "asymptotic perfection."  Do I think that Glosa
is "good enough" for basic communication?  Almost.  Again, I just think
that it needs a better base vocabulary selection from already existing
materials and better presentation.

    Presentation I suppose coulds be done by anybody, unless G.E.O.
tries to pull a Schleyer over a copyright issue.  But who has the
authority to make a better vocabulary selection, particularly
considering that there are already Glosa materials "out there"?

The "v" is perfect, it's the "i" that's the problem.  "Vu" would be better (and
maybe easier to remember because it's like "tu"??).

Glosa has the possibility to improve on the Esperanto mess-up:
Esperanto: ni = we, vi = you
Swedish: ni= you, vi = we

True, with 5000 human languages, false friends are always going to occur.

But one can at least check new words against the 12 largest languages to avoid
"serious false friends".   (In contrast to for example "slightly embarrassing
false friends" which would I guess include Esperanto's farti and peti :-)

I consider "vi" to be a  "serious false friend" because a) it's part of the core
language (Glosa-1000), and b) it false-friends to something semantically too
similar and hence confusing.


Is deprecating "vi" and introducing "vu" still possible in Glosa, or is it too
late?

Regards,
Aaron.

I hope they are aware of the list, and I wish they'd participate!  This

True, the internet has not reached everyone yet.  I especially wish that Chinese
speaking Glosaists were present here because their insights into grammar could
be especially valuable in avoiding any subconscious English language thinking /
idioms.

> How and by whom can Glosa change,
> if at all?

Changes should be few before the baseline, and occur very very rarely afterwards
(=> netushebleco).  Additions are to be avoided unless discussion on Glosalist
reveals them to be really necessary.  (Note that Basic English failed, and a
Glosa-1600 with Glosa-6000 available feels the right size to me).

Who makes the changes?  Well, maybe it should be for voting on Glosalist?
Newcomers like me could propose, but could not vote.

My understanding is that the Glose baseline has not yet been reached, so my
proposal of changing "vi" to "vu" has merit.  In Esperanto "vi" can't be changed
and the language stuck with the problem; in Glosa the door is still open, so the
luxury of fixing "vi" is still available for consideration by the Glosa
list/community.

I agree totally.  Glosa is not a linguistic toy merely to be tinkered with.  My
proposal of "vu" is not made lightheartedly.

I am confused by shifting sands feli/felis, cience/skience.  My Euro-Glosa
(1992) stuff must be outdated -- Glosa needs good configuration management (ie a
Web address that always has the most recent Glosa vocab.)

And I'm annoyed by the couple (only a couple) of faults like vi, su (too much
like sous=under for *me*, but maybe it's okay) and gnata (can't easily pronounce
that one, sorry guys).

I have some ideas on presentation that I'll give later (I need to get vi/vu
sorted first).

See my note above on feli/felis.  This *really* needs to be sorted out.

Given Europe's current position, I would say that the Glosa-1000 baseline needs
to be done quite soon (within the next year?).

The word "copyright" confuses newcomers and puts them off.

    I heartily agree.  However, the few attempts I made to exchange some
emails with them were hardly successful.  I got the impression that they
just are not comfortable with this medium of communication.  Also, I am
not certain of the telephone and internet hookup situation in the UK,
but I have the impression that it may be more expensive than in the US
or some other countries, so that they may consider email too much of a
pinch financially.

    Still, without their participation, things are a little nebulous.  I
honestly do not know what their attitude is toward discussions such as
go on here on Glosalist.  Nor do I have any idea what their position is
with respect to proposed "shifts" (to avoid the word "changes") with
regard to Glosa.

    Again, I heartily agree.  I once, quite some time ago, exchanged two
regular mail letters in Glosa with a man in China who said he did not
really know English (and I have no Chinese), and the communication
seemed to go well enough.  The feedback from non-Indo-European speakers
would be very useful.  There may be something of a division of labor
between those on the 'net and those not.  Such a state of affairs might
or might not bode well, depending on one's approach to things.

    Robin Gaskell, you seem to have the most contact with Richmond.  Do
you have any way of sounding out their attitude toward what goes on
here?

    As for size, my approach has been that the basic vocabulary should
be of manageable size and that something like "6000" should be used
sparingly if at all.  After all, if all you know is "1600" (or whatever
the size is) and I start throwing out words from "6000," we will have a
communication problem, the very thing Glosa is supposed to help avoid.

    Again, I concur with your position regarding changes.  In my mind
the question is whether Glosa was more or less baselined in 1992 (or
whenever).  I myself do not think that the 1992 publications should be
considered a baseline for the simple reason that they are not consistent
among themselves!  The terminal-vowel issue needs to be cleaned up, as
does the problem with two Glosa words (one Greek, one Latin) for the
same thing.  If you learn A and I learn B, we still have a communication
problem.

    And, of course, my position is that the base vocabulary selection
needs to be improved.  Once these matters are taken care of, I opine
that things need to be stabilized.  One problem, however, will be those
people not on the 'net who are already using the older materials.

> Who makes the changes?  Well, maybe it should be for voting on Glosalist?
> Newcomers like me could propose, but could not vote.

    I would say that Glosalist is too small a sample of potential or
actual users to be authoritative.  Consultative, maybe.  Also, as I see
it, there is still the issue of what G.E.O. might think about things.
To me this is a *big* bugaboo.

    A secondary issue is presentation.  At one time I faulted the
"Mechanics of Glosa" approach of isolated paradigmatic sentences.  I
have ameliorated my position on that somewhat if the approach were
expanded to include blocks of connected text which would show that it
simply is not necessary to mark everything under the sun all the time
(such as noun markers for plurality, and aspect and tense markers on
verbs), as some people seem to want to do.  Non-Indo-European-native
users of Glosa might not do so, and others had better get used to not
being swamped with redundant markers.  Some connected text could
demonstrate this in the "Mechanics of Glosa."

    As I mentioned, my personal position is that 'vi' is not
particularly a problem, as I see Glosa for use by potentially everybody,
including by those for whom there would not be a collision issue.  I
would hope that things do not fall apart on small matters which do not
even seem important to some.  And again, Glosalist is hardly the entire
Glosa community, such as it is.  All in all, I think myself that all
that is needful, apart from better presentation (including in many more
languages), is cleanup of the terminal vowel problem, abolition of
synonyms, and a better selection of base vocabulary, and that enough
"raw material" is already available.  I would leave basic constructs
such as the pronoun system alone, although if I were going to do more in
depth I would accept whatever changes officially or quasi-officially
come about.

    Yes, the current publications are inconsistent among themselves, and
this is a severe problem, in my opinion.  Is 'X' this, that, or
something else?  I know that Robin has made the point that Ashby & Clark
did the best they could in pre-computer days, doing things by hand on a
shoestring budget.  I grant that.  It is also highly irrelevant what
their personal circumstances were then or are now.  The "interlanguage
marketplace" does not know or care about the personal circumstances of
Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby.  Sorry, but that's the blunt and unkind
truth.  What is important is the product, not the manufacturer.  If
Glosa is to remain tied to the personal fortunes in life of Ashby &
Clark, it will die.  If they don't let go of it, it will die.  Period.

    When I worked up the WWW pages that got their approval, insofar as
possible I did not try to impose my own ideas on Glosa, except that I
almost had to make a selection here and their on the terminal vowel
issue.

    As for a web address with the current stuff, I can foresee the
possibility that some people might balk for the very reason that so many
Glosa-pe simply do not have computer access.

    Yes, all these word-ending problems definitely need to be fixed, in
my opinion also.  I really think it is not so important whether "cat" is
'felis' or 'feli' or whether "you" (plural) is 'vi' or 'vu'.  What is
important is that they be something _consistently_agreed_upon_.

    I'm not sure just what you mean by "Europe's current position."
However, I do think that the basic vocabulary does need to be baselined
or re-baselined fairly soon (whenever that is).  As it currently is, I
am skeptical that Glosa would find much acceptance on a quasi-official
or official level in something like the EU.

    True.  Is it desired that Glosa be spread as a sincerely-proposed
medium of communication, or is it to be milked as a cash cow under the
guise of copyright protection?  Zamenhof deliberately and explicitly
disclaimed copyright for Esperanto and placed it in the public domain,
even though he remained the primary exemplar of good Esperanto usage.
Very wise decision, in my estimation.

+++++++

    A few final comments.  I admit that at present I have no real
commitment to Glosa or to any other conIAL.  At one time, I thought that
I was pulling out of the auxlang wars and placing my bet on Esperanto.
In the end, I came back, so to speak.  As someone pointed out just
within the last few days on the AUXLANG list, getting involved with
auxlangs can be fun, even if one does not become proficient in _any_ of
them.  That is more or less my situation currently.  Although my remarks
about Glosa are sincere, I have never sat down really to learn it and
use it.  Perhaps others have the attitude, as I do, that it is just not
yet in a sufficiently stable state in order to induce me to put much
effort into it.  (And I note that nearly all the posts on Glosalist are
in English.  I would have a hard time putting all this into Glosa
myself.)

vide means seeing (adj), to see (verb), the see-er (noun), and? the act of seeing

ge- reverses the direction of the act,

    I have had a chance to look at these web pages.  A couple of
observations.

    First, I was totally unable to download the dictionary files.  My
web browser reported that the ftp addresses were badly formed.  The
format  ftp:ge.exe  or whatever is not an absolute address or even a
relative one, to the best of my meager knowledge.  So I can't take a
look at them.

    Second, I noticed references to the Artificial Languages Basic
Vocabulary, of which I posted word on AUXLANG some time ago.  It is
critically important to be aware that the intention is not that there
be some sort of one-for-one correspondence between this list and the
vocabulary of any given IAL.  Not at all.  The matter is whether a
conIAL has adequate vocabulary to express what this list expresses, and
NOT that it necessarily have as many words.  In fact, not having as
many words by literal count may come to be an advantage if it is
workable.  This list arose in an English context, and nothing says that
any conIAL has to be merely a relexification of English.

+++++

    In the last few days, in a somewhat disjointed fashion, I have
offered a few thoughts about the state of Glosa and what it needs in 
my estimation.  I thought I would try to set those out a little more
consistently.

    1) Resolution of the word-termination confusion.  In some
instances, the same Glosa word for a single concept has different
terminal vowels (or occasionally consonant/vowel alternation) in
different G.E.O. publications.  In other instances, two different Glosa
words for different concepts differ only by their terminal vowels. 
This state of affairs involves confusion and needs badly to be
rectified so that word endings are consistent.

    2) Abolition of synonyms.  In some instances, a given concept has
two Glosa words, one from Latin and one from Greek.  This synonymy
should be abolished.  If Person 1 learns word A and Person 2 learns
word B, they still cannot communicate, the very situation Glosa is
supposed to deal with.

    3) More judicious selection of basic vocabulary from existing
materials.  So-called Glosa 1000 does not exist consistently among
G.E.O. publications, and collation of various lists of so-called Glosa
1000 produced a list of 1500 - 1600 words.  (I did not count exactly.)
I do not endorse use of Glosa 6000 for general use.  One of the strong
points of Glosa is limited vocabulary to be learned.  At the same time,
an effective, judiciously-chosen basic vocabulary may well require more
than one thousand words.  There should not be some sort of quasi-
mystical attachment to a list of precisely one thousand words.  If
"Glosa 1000" must become "Glosa 1500" or whatever for a more effective
vocabulary, then so be it.

    4) Enhancement of the "Mechanics of Glosa" to include connected
samples of text.  It is true that children do not learn their native
tongues from grammar books.  But neither do they learn divorced from a
context.  They receive feedback, both verbal and nonverbal, from their
elders.  The present "Mechanics of Glosa" consists of context-free
paradigmatic sentences which cannot exemplify the necessary feedback. 
Therefore, potential learners do not know that it is not necessary
always to mark verbs for tense and aspect or nouns for plurality. 
Provision of exemplary samples of connected text would provide much
needed enhancement of the "Mechanics of Glosa."

    5) Resolution of how and by whom enhancements and vocabulary
adjustments can occur.

Paul                             <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

Interesting. That should be sufficient, and I know it used to work when
I had Internet Explorer 2 because I use it on other, older pages. But it
doesn't seem to work for me now, using IE3. My new configuration, or lack
thereof, I suspect. When no path is given in a URL, the browser is supposed
to use the current directory as the default path.

Aaron was able to download, but got an illegal operation when he tried to
execute it. We're looking into that. It works for me, honest!

Anyway, give it another shot. I've created four links for each file;
both selfextracting and regular zipfiles, via ftp and http for each.
I noticed that when I slide my pointer over the http links, the URL
shown at the bottom *does* show the complete path, even though I'm
not giving it in the link. But it does not show the complete path for
the ftp: version. Right now, I don't know if IE has changed or my
configuration needs work.

The htp:program.zip links worked for me. If you've got pkunzip, you
should probably try those first. If not, I'll be glad to email the
files. But I do want to figure out what's going on here! Thanks for
letting me know of the problem.

Understood. I do mention some considerations of that sort on the page,
synonyms and such, and Glosa combinations that might have the relevant
meanings. No es problema!

I think I'll probably need to make another synonym pass through the
sourcefile. In the simpler dictionaries I've eliminated the Glosa
words that were synonyms for a given English word in the file, but
I didn't explicitly look for English synonyms in the file, though I
did handle them when I noticed them. For example, if Glosa1 and Glosa2
mapped to English1, and Glosa3 and Glosa4 to English2, then I would
have eliminated one of each of those Glosa words. But what if English1
and English2 were themselves synonyms? Then we would be left with just
one Glosa word.

Interesting. That should be sufficient, and I know it used to work when
I had Internet Explorer 2 because I use it on other, older pages. But it
doesn't seem to work for me now, using IE3. My new configuration, or lack
thereof, I suspect. When no path is given in a URL, the browser is supposed
to use the current directory as the default path.

Aaron was able to download, but got an illegal operation when he tried to
execute it. We're looking into that. It works for me, honest!

Anyway, give it another shot. I've created four links for each file;
both selfextracting and regular zipfiles, via ftp and http for each.
I noticed that when I slide my pointer over the http links, the URL
shown at the bottom *does* show the complete path, even though I'm
not giving it in the link. But it does not show the complete path for
the ftp: version. Right now, I don't know if IE has changed or my
configuration needs work.

The htp:program.zip links worked for me. If you've got pkunzip, you
should probably try those first. If not, I'll be glad to email the
files. But I do want to figure out what's going on here! Thanks for
letting me know of the problem.

Understood. I do mention some considerations of that sort on the page,
synonyms and such, and Glosa combinations that might have the relevant
meanings. No es problema!

I think I'll probably need to make another synonym pass through the
sourcefile. In the simpler dictionaries I've eliminated the Glosa
words that were synonyms for a given English word in the file, but
I didn't explicitly look for English synonyms in the file, though I
did handle them when I noticed them. For example, if Glosa1 and Glosa2
mapped to English1, and Glosa3 and Glosa4 to English2, then I would
have eliminated one of each of those Glosa words. But what if English1
and English2 were themselves synonyms? Then we would be left with just
one Glosa word.

    Just a word.  Nut$crape and Internut Exploder are NOTORIOUS for not
following international standards.  They seem to think that they are
above the rules.  Not everybody uses them, believe it or not.  Because
they are notoriously unreliable in this regard, I think that the safest

work.  Even so, I downloaded the actual HTML source to the pages, and I
still don't think that something like  http:eg.exe  is a valid format

    Just to clarify, what I was referring to were such pairs as
kosmo/universa, strata/via, helio/sola, krepita/susura, and many, 
many more, with both members of a pair standing for the same thing.  
In my own humble opinion, these sorts of pairs should be abolished
unmercifully.

In a way I agree with you, and if you were to examine all my html sources
you'd find that some of my main links are absolute. The argument *for*
relative addresses is not just that it's less work, but also less chance
for error if you relocate pages to another directory or machine. Also,
since I develop on my home machine and then upload to my ISP, I wouldn't
be able to test on my local machine unless I converted all the absolutes
to relatives for testing, made my changes, then converted back before
uploading. (Hmmm. Perhaps I could write a script to do that for me. Hmmm.)
But not too long ago I realized something that argues strongly *against*
relative addresses: if *you* download my page, the links will point to
*your* machine and *your* directory, and the other files won't be there
unless you downloaded all of them too! And you won't be able to get back
to one of my pages by clicking on one of my links anymore.

(Oh, the agony and the ecstacy of relative addressing. As usual, a middle
way, a bit of both, is probably the best way; but right now I'm just a bit
too far over on the side of relativity.)

So one thing I did a month or so ago was change all the back-to-my-homepage
links (and a few others) to absolute so that if anybody really wanted to
find me again, there'd be at least one clue on each page!

Tee hee hee!

But here's why it works. Consider the full link:

   <a href="http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/eg.exe">

If the file is on the local machine, you can remove the machine name:

   <a href="http:/~ailanto/eg.exe">

And if it's in the current directory, you can remove the directory part:

   <a href="http:eg.exe">

You could use relative directory paths too. Some people like to keep their
images in a subdirectory, so you'll see something like:

   <img src="images/picture.gif">

And if you really want to make something ugly, you could back up a level:

   <img src="../images/picture.gif">

It's really just a historical Unix convention.

*	The Glosa authors do know about the Glosalist: I discussed it with them
before attempting to set it up; periodically, I redirect messages and "Cc:"
postings to them (as I am this one); and they noted appreciation for my
report on the List, in Glosa, for publication in Plu Glosa Nota.
	The question of changes is 'interesting.'  Most changes are at the
applications development level, not at the fundamental vocabulary level,
but democracy should more-or-less apply.  If everyone was Networked, we
could say: "Listen guys, from midnight 30th May, the 2nd Person Plural
pronoun is "vu" not "vi". OK. Please change this in your memory banks,
thank you."
	The question of our getting together, mounting a case for "vu" against
"vi", and deliberating on it is not the stumbling block.  In the Glosa
set-up, we are more or less paper-based, and many people have some fairly
ancient copies of the Glosa 1000 list.  Inertia is the main problem:
we would have to tell all of our widely and thinly spread Glosa-pe about
the change .. and 'pidgeon postage' is one of the killer costs for the
authors.  As well as that, when dictionaries are reprinted, then retooling
is needed so that new dictionaries carry the revision(s) - they are printed
by a Printer.
	Perhaps we can get the authors to change over to in-house publishing,
where they would have considerably more control over their 
vocabulary databases.  Disadvantages of this idea are: the cost of a good
printer; labour requirements of the authors in printing, collating and
binding; and the loss of professional finish on dictionaries.
	I have invited Ron Clarke and Wendy Ashby to subscribe to the Glosalist,
but their decision to be off the List is basically an economic one: the
language reform business does not pay well.  Were I more economically
astute, I would offer to subsidise their Net payments, but, sadly, I think
better than I play economics.

*	A good case here for the delegation of authority: I was writing to
Chinese and African Glosa-pe, before I started trawling the Net for other
affluents to help with the correspondence.  We are looking for people to do
'disinterested' research by using Glosa to write to such non-English-based
learners.

*	So far discussion on the Glosalist confirms belief in the need for a
learners' dictionary somewhere between the 1000-word and 6000-word sizes:
Paul Bartlett suggests around 1600 to 1800, and I feel it would grow to
about 2000.
	Almost all changes, so far, have been made by the authors: '81 to '92 was
marked by regular gradual change, but the '92 "Glosa 6000" stabalised the
language.  This dictionary now needs recasting and reprinting to iron out
inconsistencies - but, again, this is an economic challenge.  In a reprint,
the slight change of spelling of a pronoun could occur, but the authors
would need to be convinced of the linguistic superiority of the new form.
I don't know why "vi" was chosen: perhaps "vu" was reserved for another
lexeme; does "vu" 'feel' better in the spoken language .. I haven't had
time to test it.

*	Over the development of Glosa 1972 - 98, the 'voting' style of democracy
was not the mode.  The authors have kept a fairly strong hold on the
language; however, changes in the use of the language by others have come
from just that: usage.  While most users of Glosa, now and in the future,
could live with either "vi" or "vu", I suggest that you write to the
authors, directly, detailing your case for a change.
	Concerning the "List/community," numerically the Glosalist is a distinct
minority: were we called upon to field a team of Glosa speakers to-morrow,
we would have to fly in the Ugandans; I would volunteer to be twelfth man.
Academically, Linguistically and technologically the Glosalist has
considerable weight, but I can understand the great 
significance for the authors of creating a group that is fluent in the use
of the language - as it stands.

if both singular and plural 2nd Person pronouns in Glosa, my evaluation of
them has been .. in the mouth.  One thought is that the present "vi" not
only translates into Eng. 'you', it also represents Eng. 'your' and
'yours'.  When I write Glosa, I always listen, as well, for the sounds of
the words - in my head: "vi" has 'sounded good' so far, so I, personally,
would have to give the same test to "vu", before I could say what I thought
about the proposed change.

*	Apologies from me re "felis": this is Old Glosa, and I sometimes lapse
into it.  The 'brevo' form "feli" is in the "Glosa 6000" dictionary, and
this, for obvious reasons, is the version I should choose.  The rendition
of Eng. 'science' into Glosa has had a more chequered history: the authors
have experimented with different ways, including the English-lookalike
"science."  It never was "cience": your 1000-word list could carry a typo;
"Glosa 6000" ('92) shows "skience" and this, uncritically, is good enough
for me.  From my perspective in the promotion of Glosa, there are more
critical battles than a skirmish around the spelling of one particular word.
	However, you do deserve to have my understandings on this situation: in
Glosa, there exists a triangle with Classical-root-word,
one-sound-per-letter, and best-sound at its apices; in matching all these
factors, sometimes a compromise has had to be made to produce the best 
spelling/pronunciation combination; the English-language concept 'science'
has tested this triangular word-formation process.
	Now, with "ski" = 'know, knowing, knowlege', we have the *process of
gaining knowlege* as "ski(-)ence".  I don't know about the credentials of
the "-ence" part, but it is cognate with the Old Glosa "esce" = 'become'.
However, "eske", the current synonym of "gene" (= 'become'), is not in
"Glosa 6000"; so, I simply see the word "skience" as the best result of the
triangualar compromise.  But, pronouncing it is a different story.
Taking Glosa's one-letter-one-sound semi-phonetic pronunciation, and
applying standard Italian pronunciation to the vowels, standard European
pronunciation to the consonants .. and the special Glosa extension of the
Italian -ci- and -ce- pronunciations to all -cVOWEL- combinations .. we
render the phonics, in crude Gaskell symbols, as  skEE'AYn'CH-AY .
	[Note: Use of these phonic symbols is not for the feint-hearted, but, sure
as hell, it is a lot easier than the International Phonetic Alphabet, as
used by the Collins Cobuild dictionaries.  I do not use such symbols for
normal Glosa teaching: I would rather buy a cheap cassette player and send
it with a cassette of spoken Glosa, than expect people to fight their way
through any phonetic/phonic system.]

*	You see "vi" and "su" as *errors* because they are opposite usages to
those in some natlangs, and "gnata" in *error* because of its difficult
initial consonant combination.  Nice to see someone else come out and say a
language has "faults": I was jumped on when I said Esperanto had 'design
faults.'
	I am not going further on "vi", but I would say that in "su" we have
another 'brevo' form derived from Old Glosa: "supra" (= above) is O.G.
directly from the Latin dictionary, thus with impeccable credentials.  Once
we had "sur" = 'on' O.G., derived from Latin words for `over` and `up`:
with French having ~sous~ = 'under' and ~sur~ = 'on', can I be Politically
Correct and suggest that, perhaps, in this case, French is **at fault**?
Maybe not; Alliance Francaise would never hear of it.  So, taking the
French language as a 'given,' perhaps the abbreviation of "supra" to "su"
is unwise, even if it does deliver a shorter function word. 
	An initial "gn-" is 'transliterated' from the Greek, and, as such is
awkward to the ears of people speaking softer languages: possibly, in such
cases, the Latin synonym would be more suitable.

*	Nice to hear.  I guess that subscribers to this List should do a revised
Introductory Dictionary for presentation to the authors.  One of the strong
considerations behind preparation of a short starter vocabulary is cost -
both of production and postage.  When the authors get a request for more
information about Glosa, they do wish to send a wordlist to the enquirer,
but the expense of satisfying each request must be debited against Glosa
Education Organisation funds.  So, any upwards revision of the starter
dictionary must be, rationally, within the G.E.O. budget.

*	Quite so.  I understand that the Authors believe the language to be
reasonably stabalised, if not 'baselined', at the 1000-word and 6000-word
levels, already.  A dialogue with the authors on an extension and revision
of the shorter list seems like a good idea.  It would be easier to regulate
with low-cost, in-house printing; however, the reality is a paper-based
production and clientelle.  Maybe, with the technological resouces of those
on this List, we could help the authors innovate electronic management of
these dictionaries.  I failed to export moribund electronic equipment to
Uganda, because of import duties; but, no such opposition prevents our
providing the authors, in England, with a moribund Letter Quality printer
for their IBM clone system.  Any offers?

With, much of their income from dictionary sales, the authors are loath to
release the "Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Net.  Can we, as a 'think tank'
come up with a formula that permits electronic management of the lexicon so
that as well as ensuring, and hopefully, increasing, the authors' income
from sales, it also allows the Starter Dictionary to be made available as
Shareware?
	Aaron, as a 'newcomer at the Glosalist level, you are seeing Glosa from a
very different viewpoint from most Glosa-pe.  The bulk of present Glosa-pe
is off the Net, so comments of "copyright" on this list, and in Webpages
does not reach them.  However, all Internet savvy people understand the
concept of "Shareware", which incorporates the copyright idea, so provision
of a "Glosa 2000" as Shareware would .. theoretically .. 
protect the authors' copyright.
	Since you were sensible enough to provide your Land Address, I can send
you the scanned (and reversed) version of "Glosa 6000", on disk.  By
sending the Glosa->English and English->Glosa lists off the Net, we give
you an electronically usable form of the dictionaries.  While avoiding
global publishing, this provides a very limited circulation to List
subscribers only.  However, I would like to be able to offer a Shareware
version of the dictionaries over the Internet: is there a way we can
convince the authors that such a ploy would result in increased sales of
printed dictionaries?

Karo plu Glosa-pe!

I wish to second the major (and minor) points that Robin makes:
	1. Glosa is still appropriately under the management of Ron and 
Wendy, who are, by the way, very reasonable folk, in my opinion and 
experience.  Any changes in G should proceed from GEO.
	2. It is perhaps reasonable to change VI to VU, although I would 
need to see a strong argument in its favor.  The fact that French, for 
example, suggests 'vu' could lead to all sorts of changes -- this has 
happened historically in Esperanto with no appreciably helpful results.  
Still, any such change would have economic costs (for R&W) and I would 
question its worth.
	3. It is true that languages evolve, but usually from a rather 
substantial base, and I am not totally sold that that basis has been set 
up yet.  For example, I still would like to see a more descriptive 
grammar, in the sense of 'rules,' developped, so that all can agree on 
syntax.  Not to overstate my case, I agree fully that G has no grammar in

    I will respond to a few points here and there of Robin's post.  I
know that I will be repeating myself somewhat, so please bear with me. 
Then I will try to be quiet.  At the same time, I do think that general
agreement is more important than getting my own way.  It's just that I
think there is still room for disagreement.

    Definitely.  However, as some of the Esperantists have point out,
"action" in Esperanto on the 'net is only a tiny portion of real-world
Esperanto usage.  Proabaly something similar applies to Glosa, even
with a much, much smaller user base.  Those of us who are hooked on the
'net have to realize this.

    Again, and again, and yet again, there simply is no one "Glosa
1000" list.  I have different, "official" copyrighted "Glosa 1000"
lists from G.E.O., and they simply do not agree among themselves.  In
the few copies of Plu Glosa Nota that I read, I noticed that the
authors themselves used words which were not in any "Glosa 1000" list
avaiable to me.

    This is admittendly a problem, but it may not be insurmountable. 
If there were to be a new, more or less standardized vocabulary built
out of existing materials, chances are that usage could smooth the way
with those who do not have it.

    Propagation on Glosa must not be dependent on the finances of
Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark.  Advocates of other auxiliary languages seem
to have realized this long ago.  Consider Schleyer versus Zamenhof.

    Same point.  However, again I remain unsure what is their reaction
to the activity that goes on on this list.  Robin, you seem to have the
most and closest contact with G.E.O.  Do you _really_ know how they
regard such things as standardizing word terminals, abolition of
synonyms, and base vocabulary selection?  Are they going to stand in
the way of putting things like this on the 'net?  I certainly hope not,
because if they try to pull a Schleyer (or a Leslie Jones), Glosa is
headed for deep, deep water.

    But if there is a "learners' dictionary" and other people go off
using using a large vocabulary, communication quickly breaks down,
reinstituting the condition that an auxlang is supposed of take care
of.  Some pidgin languages get along with a very modest vocabulary. 
One of Glosa's selling points is that it should not be necessary to
master a large vocabulary.  I could be wrong, but I think that the
basic vocabulary of Lojban, of all things, is in the low thousands.  It
should be fairly obvious by now that I do not approve of general use of
Glosa 6000.  Frankly, I personally am not interested in wrestling with
that size of vocabulary.

    Do they intend to continue to dominate it, as Schleyer did with
Volapük?  Maybe it's just me, but I think that the attitude of
Clark&Ashby to what goes on here is a very serious issue.  Also, are
all publications forever to come out of Richmond, Surrey?  I certainly
am in no position, for instance, to do any publishing, but if G.E.O.
is not only the source of all wisdom but also of all materials, I think
trouble is ahead.  As I mentioned before, the sad but blunt truth is
that the marketplace does not know or care about the personal affairs
of Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark and their finances.  I think this issue
needs to be faced squarely by everybody -- including them.

    Chances are good that no matter how you design an auxlang, somebody
is going to find "faults" with it.  That's why I do not get too worked
over things like 'su' and 'vi'.  (And I do _not_ find 'gnata' hard to
pronounce.)

    I don't think the presentation needs so much to be revised as
merely supplemented with specimens of connected exemplary text.  In the
Basic Reference on the web, I took the paradigmatic sentences right out
of G.E.O. publications.  (Except, as I recall, in some cases I may have
used 'feli' for 'kani'.)  However, I think the base vocabulary issue
needs to be addressed first before the extended text specimens are
composed, and all of the "Mechanics" definitely needs to be restricted
(and corrected) to the provided vocabulary.  It is not so much a matter
of revising anything (except for consistency) as supplementing what is
already there.

    Is no one else willing to put any money into Glosa?  I admit that
I cannot at present, but if no one else is willing to, Glosa is in
something of a dangerous condition.  It MUST not remain tied to the
personal situations of Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby.

    I fear that they are too much taken with some sort of
quasi-mystical significance of a magic one thousand words.  Their own
publications reveal that they themselves have not been able to stick
consistently with a single list of one thousand (or at least, they have
not done so).

    Bad idea, in my opinion.  Greater dissemination of Glosa requires
widest possible dissemination of materials, regardless of whether that
dissemination hits somebody in the pocketbook.  I am not aware thae
Zamenhof got particularly rich off Esperanto.

    I have spoken my piece.  I will try not to belabor the points more.

An excellent idea, a natlang-independent beginner's instruction book.
And a number of good ideas for the implementation. I have one suggestion
which though violating the purity of the idea might make it more easily
achievable: a small companion booklet in the natlang, something small
and fairly easy to produce, in which particularly troublesome bootstrap
information could be provided. Maybe even just a page to be inserted - it
might go a long way towards simplifying that startup task.

I was wondering about the GEO, and its organization, and the worldwide
distribution of the glosa-pe. Is the A&C address all there is? I mean
physically; not on the Net. But then, on the Net, there's only three
sites I know of, Robin's and Paul's and mine. I have never seen anything
of Glosa in the real world, and if not for Robin's "Glimmering Out" post
on conlang a couple of summers ago, I probably never would have seen his
or Paul's site. (Try doing a websearch for Glosa; you'll find a bazillion
hits, none of which have anything to do with this language we're talking
about, because glosa itself is a pretty common word in the world.)

Somebody needs to do some advertising. On the Net and off.

(Though I do admit that there's really not much presence of any IAL in my
daily world, except for what I put there. I find that very irritating; in
the daily newspaper I can find sports scores from around the world, or
for the smallest team in the most little-known sport in a small town in 
a far-away corner of my state; but I don't think I've seen a real reference
to an IAL since I found the address for ELNA in an Indianapolis newspaper
15 or so years ago!) (Wait a moment, maybe that's an opportunity! Although
several other IALs have the lead, they aren't seen in daily life either.
So if we advertised even just a little bit...) 

Are there national GEO satellite offices? If not, perhaps we should start
some, if that's acceptable. That could alleviate the postage problems for
the GEO, since the national sites could handle the local traffic.

Does anybody know the size of the glosa-pe? And where they're located?

Ooooh! I made a good choice! I just checked my Dictionary Source File,
and sure enough, I had selected "supra" as the preferred synonym. Can't
say that I remember exactly why, but it does seem to me that clarity
is more important that brevity in this case.

Relexification never bothered me. There seems to be a bias in the conlang
community against using any feature of your natlang in your conlang, lest
you be merely relexifying. But if your natlang has a useful feature, why
*not* use it in your conlang? I bet German conlangers accuse each other of
relexifying German, French conlangers French, etc.

However...

Glosa is *not* relexified English. The problem is that we sometimes tend
to write relexified English using Glosa vocabulary, and if that's what the
observers see, then they think that Glosa is relexified English. We must
strive to write Glosa using Glosa grammar (assuming we know what that is),
and write lots, and get it out there where people can see it.

I agree with your comments about the two Glosa dictionaries. Why two? For
maximum utility as an IAL, just use the smaller one, and say that's it.
(Maybe also say, if you need a word that's not in here, use the straight
Latin (or Greek), so that readers will know to look in *that* dictionary
for anything they can't find in the Glosa dictionary.) Or just use the
bigger one and admit that Glosa has a large vocabulary but it's a darn
good IAL vocabulary. 

Given that the vocabulary is large, I can understand the need for a
slimmed-down version for beginners. But if that slimmed-down version
is too slim, we're all going to be using the 6000 anyway. And there will
always be beginners using the 1000 and missing many of the words being
used by us oldtimers with the 6000. So why not choose the middle path and
come up with just one standard dictionary, larger than the small one but
smaller than the large one, and complete in itself?

(Or perhaps the 1000 *is* the real-life "shareware" version, and the
omissions are the incentive to purchase the full version?)

Just omitting synonyms can slim it down quite a bit. It can be further
slimmed by omitting the extra unique words. For example, we have VERNA
and PRIMAVERA for Springtime; omit one of these synonyms. But actually,
these are not just synonyms, but extra unique words, because the official
Glosa word is BLASTO-TEM. Blasto-tem isn't as recognizable as the others,
but that's just the downside of agglutination. By learning that BLASTO is
bud/germinate, and TEM is time/period, and that BLASTO-TEM is the phrase
for Springtime, we can cut down the vocabulary considerably.

I hate to give up too many words, but perhaps a well-selected Glosa 2000
or 3000 is what we really need.

    I did once get a couple of emails from Ron Clark.  To be honest,
there were almost unreadable, as if he didn't really know how to use a
computer.  (They didn't even understand what a spell-checker is for.)
As for expenses, I am not aware of their situation -- or what the 'net

    This is a legitimate point.  "Relexification" is sometimes used as
a stick to beat things with.  I have fallen into that myself from time
to time.  And I agree that Glosa is not strictly relexified English (at
least, it doens't have to be).

    I feel quite strongly about Glosa having only a modest vocabulary. 
However, over the last few days I have said what I think needs to be
said, and I won't beat it into the ground.

    I have read the claim that Tok Pisin is used in the parliament of
Papua New Guinea, and it probably has a relatively modest word-store
apart from proper names and specialist terminology (and I don't even
know about this latter).

    My estimate, as before, is 1600 - 1800 words.  However, actual
experience is a better guide that SWAGs and hunches.

    I admit that I have not really "committed" myself to Glosa (or to
any other IAL), and I have not used it a lot.  One frustration for me
was the very vocabulary situation I have referred to.  I have just
thought that things were insufficiently well defined, so I hazve been
reluctant to put a lot into it.  However, it remains so that the most
valuable and most legitimate criticism comes from actual users and not
from armchair critics.
