   U verbi-lista freqe eqa u major problema ko u gene-sko de xeno lingua.
Ko Glosa, u-ci problema gene ge-face ma komplexi ex plu vario origi de plu
tali lista: plu ge-tipo papira fila, plu ge-publika lexiko, diktionari, e
plu vario elektronika lista epi u Reti.
   Mi du sugere ke u fo boni proto-punkta es u ge-publika bibli, "Glosa

*  Il es bi problema: anti Ron e Wendy pa tipo plu longi lista de verbi ex
Glosa a England-lingua, mu solo publika proxi mo kilo verbi ex
England-lingua a Glosa; e ka mu pa uti plu paleo Greko e Latino lingua
(simi plu skientia-pe), un uti de plu-ci verbi habe asocia ko bi primitive
e no-tekno kultura.
   So, te gene plu semani de poli de plu-ci 'klasiko' verbi, uno-pe nece
loka an menta intra u tem de u Romani-pe de histori.  Ko-co, intra plu
prima verbi-lista, mu freqe inklude bi Latino e Greko versio de plu verbi -
habe u homo semani.

*   I will agree - in theory; however, it is in the practice of using a
non-inflected language .. especially for those whose native tongue is
inflected and contains much non-literal language .. that I observe a
reticence in trying to use the language.  Were more on the Glosalist to try
their hand at typing messages in Glosa, then it would be more convincing an
argument.

   I will agree, if Glosa IS going to take off, it will be on the Net!
Maybe our job is to make it eminently Net-amenable.

    Please Charles give us something to go on: please give examples, using
both LsF and Glosa equivalent words, to show how the LsF rules do it
better, than Glosa's more or less ^ad hoc^ extraction of its vocab from the
Classical Roots.

   POR .... maybe a typo, but it could be a small function word .. if there
is a function not adequately covered by Glosa .. ?in favour of?

   Every now and then I come across a legitimate concept I want to express,
but, for which, I can find no suitable function word.
   There may be some room for improvement in this area of Glosa's lexicon.

Actually, there's a webpage by Jay Bowks that describes Peano's LsF ...
It takes any Latin dictionary as its base, so special dictionaries are
not needed; anyone can use the LsF rules to determine the word form.
For example, FAVEO FAVERE FAVI FAUTUM FAVOR FAVORIS FAVORUM etc are
inflected forms of the same root "concept". Only the FA- part is
common to all. So how to decide the official form? They are taken
from the ablative case of the noun, which is somehow derivable from
the verbs and adjectives (but I forget how). LsF also has a rule
that any word that appears in enough (3?) European languages is
considered "international" and therefore officially included.

Glosa likewise needs to state its word-selection and word-form rules,
clearly enough that people other than the authors can reproduce and
update its vocabulary. If the Greek roots are to be kept, then it
would be easy enough to distinguish them from Latin roots by using
the final vowel. But this should be done systematically, not ad hoc.
And the selection of vocab can be largely automated, e.g.:

FAVOR          complaisance, favor, favorecer, favorire, favorisent, favorisez, favorisons, gentileza, grâce, obséquio, service
FAVORED        favorecido, favorisa, favorisai, favorisâmes, favorisèrent, favorisé, favorisée, favorisées, favorisés
FAVORITE       favori, favorito
FAVORITISM     favoritisme, favoritismo
FAVOUR         agradar, complaisance, faveur, favor, favore, favorecer, favoreggiare, favorire, favoriser, gentileza, grâce, obséquio, proteger, service
FAVOURABLE     favorable, favorável, opportuno, propice, propício
FAVOURITE      crack, favori, favorito

favellare      SPEAK, TALK
favolosamente  SUPER, WONDERFUL
favor          FAVOR, FAVOUR
favora         PROPERTY, RANCH
favorable      ADVANTAGEOUS, FAVOURABLE
favore         FAVOUR, PLEASE, PLEASURE, WILL, ZESTFULNESS
favorecer      CODDLE, FAVOR, FAVOUR, PAMPER, PET
favori         FAVORITE, FAVOURITE
favorire       FAVOR, FAVOUR
favoritismo    CORRUPTION, FAVORITISM
favorito       ABETS, FAVORITE, FAVOURITE, FAVOURITETY, RANCH
favorável      ADVANTAGEOUS, FAVOURABLE, FAVOURABLEM, PROPERTY, RANCH

All I did here was to grab some bilingual Romance language vocab lists
from WORDGUMBO.COM and merge/sort/collate. Clearly some form of "FAV-"
is "international" and presumably useful ... So if I were selecting words
for a Romance-based interlingua with a consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel
word-shape, FAVO would be the obvious choice. Note that we get all likely
synonyms "for free", in English French Italian Spanish and Portuguese.
I think this is the best way to do it, rather than starting from the
classical languages or scientific combining forms.

Saluta!

OK, you write that we should to use special system of derivation of Latin
roots for the Glosa's vocabulary.
But, I am afraid that after latinization of the language we will have to
eliminate the phonetic spelling. After that we will have to add Latin rules
of word-making (e.g. means for suffixes etc.). But then Glosa will become
just another 'euroDolly".
Understand, I don't say that it will be bad, but I'm not sure about it!

About Greek roots:
They are small, but stable part of the international vocab. of science, and
they are small, but stable part of Glosa. This is normal!

Your examples from dics. are right. Maybe we should find an algorythm for
derivations from Latin, but it's a difficult job. And it must not change the
Glosa 1000!

Poli ami saluta,
Alex.

Maybe start from Latin rather than Greek; or maybe ignore the Latin/Greek
and start from the living Romance languages instead. At least it should be
something systematic.

> eliminate the phonetic spelling.

Looking at Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian (because useful
bilingual word lists are more readily available for them) we can see
the diversity of possible phonetic/fonetico/phonétique spellings.
Fonetik for whom? Even within a single language there are variations,
e.g. Spanish SEGUIR, SECUAZ, SEQUITO use G/C/Q for the same root.
A good algorithm can apply a more consistent spelling that is still
easily pronounceable and mnemonic.

> After that we will have to add Latin rules
> of word-making (e.g. means for suffixes etc.).

True Glosa uses nothing but simple compounding for morphology.
So the question is what to do with things like FAVOR+ABLE.
Should it be FAVORI-ABILI, FAVO-ABLE, FAVORABIL, ... ?

> Understand, I don't say that it will be bad, but I'm not sure about it!

That's exactly how I feel about it too. But I'm certainly not happy
enough with the current Glosa to be able to recommend it as-is.
Lingua Franca Nova is much better. Just my opinion of course.

> About Greek roots:
> They are small, but stable part of the international vocab. of science, and
> they are small, but stable part of Glosa. This is normal!

OK. If we start from Romance then the useful Greek roots are included
automatically and naturally. This seems a good idea for many reasons.

> but it's a difficult job. And it must not change the
> Glosa 1000!

It's difficult, but possible and needed. The original vocabulary
probably could not be preserved, though. A vocabulary of under
3000 roots is really impossible anyway; 6000 is more realistic.
I doubt it helps to publish a subset insufficient for real use.

Anti-co, tem norma uti Glosa, mi pene nuli-kron nece plu
verba; extra mi ne-oficia Glosa kordi, ki habe solo 1300
basi-verba. Qo-kausa tu kredi; na nece ma?

And yet, in daily use, I almost never have to go beyond my
Unofficial Glosa Core, which only has 1300 roots. Why do
you believe more are needed?

Compare your list of English words with Kilgariff's list.
Note that the Longman project did attempt to define every
English word using only a small English "core" vocab;
around 3000 words. A minimal vocab is great for learning,
but in daily use excessive ambiguity is unacceptable.

Subject: [glosalist] method for selecting vocabulary
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Sun, 06 Jan 2002 22:19:01 -0800

My current thoughts about Glosa vocabulary are illustrated below
by working through an example. Comments are welcomed.

Here is the sample data, the FAM- words from a combination of bilingual
lists (from wordgumbo.com) in French, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish,
with English capitalized, and sorted by similar meaning.



famoso           CELEBRATED, FAMOUS, ILLUSTRIOUS
fameux           FAMOUS, GLORIOUS
fama             CALL, FAME, HEARSAY, RENOWN, REP, REPUTATION, REPUTE, RUMOR, RUMOUR

famine           FAMINE
faminto          HUNGRY
famelico         HUNGRY
fame             FAMINE, HUNGER

famille          FAMILY
famiglia         FAMILY
familia          FAMILY
família          FAMILY
familiar         CLOSE, INTIMATE, RELATIVE
familiare        FAMILIES
familiaridad     FAMILIARITY
familiarisa      FAMILIARIZED
familiarisai     FAMILIARIZED
familiarisâmes   FAMILIARIZED
familiarisant    FAMILIARIZING
familiarisée     FAMILIARIZED
familiarisées    FAMILIARIZED
familiarisé      FAMILIARIZED
familiarise      FAMILIARIZES
familiarisent    FAMILIARIZE
familiarisèrent  FAMILIARIZED
familiariser     FAMILIARIZE
familiarisés     FAMILIARIZED
familiarisez     FAMILIARIZE
familiarisons    FAMILIARIZE
familiarité      FAMILIARITY
familiarizarse   FAMILIARIZE
familiarmente    COLLOQUIALLY
famigliare       CONFIDENTIAL

famulo           ATTENDER, MANSERVANT, SERVANT

famaia           FAMEY



The data is quite raw, there are errors and omissions, but non-fatal.
Too much French verb conjugation, the Portuguese list has typos, etc.
I'm just trying to find a reasonable method that others can check.

There are 3 good "concept words", 1 marginal (FAMULO), 1 error (FAMAIA).
My rule is that a confirming instance is necessary for acceptance.
Some may prefer to split the concept of "family/familiar".

A major issue to resolve is how to extract the root from a word.
Taking FAME FAMA FAMI would be possible but contra-mnemonic.
Trying FAMOSO FAMINE FAMILI leaves a redundant final vowel.
I prefer FAMOS FAMIN FAMIL, allowing an optional spoken schwa,
so both Italians and French can pronounce them happily.

As for phonology, I suggest eliminating the letters K Q W X Y Z,
maybe H J too, and never mangling internationally known spelling
for a misguided and inaccurate phoneticity.

FAM- appears relatively easy, but I believe it is possible to do
the rest systematically. There are approx 6000 "concepts" in all.

This amounts to a simple method for verifying Gode's vocabulary.
I see the 3 good roots above do appear as FAMA/FAMOSE FAME FAMILIA,
and no other different roots, not even "FAMULO". And next I check
Occidental/Interlingue ... the Radicarium has FAMA/FAMOS FAME FAMILIE,
and no others. What a coincidence!

It sounds like a reasonable approach to a new Euroclone
IAL. However, it doesn't seem to bear much resemblance to
Glosa. In my opinion, doing this under the shell of the
"Glosa" name would be dishonest. It would merely be
leveraging the reputation and community of the existing
language to launch what is actually a whole new language.
At a minimum, such an effort should be labeled "NeoGlosa"
or something like that.

I am getting pretty frustrated with the community here. 

Some folks feel that Wendy is the only person who can move
the language forward. Others feel we need an official
steering committee. Still others believe the language
should evolve on its own, through usage.

We have a couple folks who want to do a radical overhaul of
Glosa to make it into a Euroclone. We have a few folks who
seem to cling to G6000/18 Steps as if the language should
never change from that point. Some folks have their own
various minor "reforms" (often so minor they probably
aren't even reforms), which don't seem to be gaining any
converts.

Some folks want a very small, tight language with as few
words as possible, while others want a very large
vocabulary. Some like the current pa/du/nu/fu scheme, while
others want to make it less ambiguous. 

So we're left with a fragmented community that lacks
commitment to the language as it stands today, and yet also
disagrees on both the direction it should go, AND on the
process that might get it there.

After a rant like this, I guess I should propose a
solution. Well, I guess the first decision(s) would be to
answer one or both of the following questions:
1. Who should control the direction of the language named
Glosa?
2. Should we aim for small, evolutionary changes, or major
overhauls?

If we actually answered one or both of those questions,
then anyone who disagreed could move on to other projects.
Those who remain would be in a strong position to actually
move forward.

Kevin

*   'Word selection rules' suggest that a computer can do it.
    I understand that as Ron Clark was going through the Roget's Thesaurus
listing of approximately 1000 major concepts, he sought the most suitable
root (from Latin or Greek, or both) to represent that particular concept.
    While somewhat unsuccessful in actually limiting the synonyms to a
maximum of two (one from Latin, and one from Greek), Ron looked at the
roots ...
   sought letter combinations that did not clash with other words,
   accepted both one Greek and one Latin word - if they agreed with the
first condition,
   after some experimentation with a free choice of terminal vowel, Ron
settled for the most common - in science and the national languages ..
while checking these back against commonality in the original classical forms,
   subsequently, when it was discovered that some roots, for quite
different concepts, were either identical, or differed only in their
terminal vowel, a(n arbitrary) decision was made on the particular terminal
vowel to be used to distinguish concepts.

   If the above represents a "set of word selection rules" I am not sure,
but it does represent a 'description' of what actually happened, whlile it
might not represent a 'prescription' for what can happen in the future.

   So, for the addition of words representing important concepts not
included in, say, the "Glosa 6000" dictionary, or for technical terms for
the 'special interest' and 'areas of human enterprise' lists to be appended
to the standard Glosa list (approx. 6000 words), I wiuld say that a set of
prescriptive rules should be derived.
   While I imagine that such a 'coining' process for new Glosa words will
be much the same as it was during the initial stage, described above, I
might make some observations which are not necessarily authorised Glosa lore.
   New forms:-
    should not clash with existing Glosa words, though might only differ in
the terminal vowel,
    will probably be longer than the present range of Glosa words,
    are likely to include a number of compounds - mostly, or always,
having their components joined using hyphens,
    where alternative terminal vowels seem of equivalent value, the 
(feel,) sound, and appearance of equivalent alternatives ought to be
considered, and a decision taken by a suitable panel of adjudicators (of
possibly five people).

   When a subject matter expert is selecting suitable Glosa words for a 
'special technical appendix' he, or she, should not be bothered by
agonising over every word - beyond the observations above, or something
like them.  However, such 'technical appendices' would need to be edited,
rather symathetically, by an 'editing panel' that basically checked the
neologisms out for clashes with other words and for the general "feel" of
the words, as being 'within Glosa guidelines'.

  One somewhat contentious point is the need for suitable appendixes, which
alter the 'category' of a word.  And, while the Glosa authors gave us the
"18 Generic Terms" (Glosa 6000, 1992, p19),
 EG  posta = to post, the post; posta-pe = post-person; posta-ra = parcel,
there is also a group of longer, modifying post-fixes that have been used
from time to time in Glosa, and which possibly need augmentation to make
the labnguage more useful .. allowing it to be described as a "full language."
 EG greso = walk; gres-abili = walkable
    kapital = capital; kapital-ismo = capitalism [kapitalismo in "Glosa 6000"]
  Some find the hyphen unworkable, unpronouncable and a confounded
nuisance; others see it as basic to the integrity of Glosa words, and as
eminently computer readable.  If such post-fixes are to be added to Glosa,
I believe that they ought to be hyphenated.
  I believe that a list of suitable concept-expanding post-fixes is needed
to make Glosa a more humanly-usable language.  N.B. Such affixes are not
seen, by me, to be equivalent to the gramatical inflections found in many
European languages and in Esperanto.

*   I know that most comfortable languages give the facility to curl the
tongue up, out, etc, producing a range of inflections, that are formidable
for the non-native speaker to learn.
    The above list does give the feeling of such a range of inflections
developed over the historical evolution of a language.  It does not seem in
line with the original premise of either Interglossa or Glosa.

  While Glosa words began with the "Prime Directive":
      ''No Glosa word changes for reason of grammar,''
the idea of grammatical inflection cuts across this; the hyphenated
conceptual post-fixes, on the other hand, do not.

  So, it is my guess that some of the words in the Latin dictionary and
WORDGUMBO.COM-derived list are Glosa words intheir own right, and others
could be seen as derivative words, formed through the addition of
post-fixes .. of either two, or more, letters.
 I.E. FAVORI  ...  favor        \
      FAVORITA ..  favourite     \ "Glosa 6000"

      FAVOR-ISMO    ...  favoring, the showing of favour  
      FAVORIT-ISMO  ...  having favourites, the promotion of favourites

      FAVOR-ABILI   ...  the finding of favour
      
      GE-FAVORI-PE  ...  favoured person
      FAVORITA-PE  ....  favourite person

  And possibly  -FAVO = with favour  could be a postfix
      DICE-FAVO   .....  speak with favour about
      AKTI-FAVO   .....  act favourably towards

  That about covers the items on the list derived by Charles, but I must
add that, in Glosa, FAVORI would be used like all Glosa substantive words,
as 'noun', 'verb' and modifier:-
 EG  Place don a mi u-ci favori.   .........................  'N'
     Fe pa favori u-la juve andra tem u holo nokta.  .......  'V'
     An favori dice de an fe-fili.    ....... Modifier .... 'Adverb'
     [he speaks favourably of his d.]
     Iso u favori-ra fe ki ko fe an-fili ad u cinema. ..Mod. 'Adjecive'    
     [ as a favour thing she goes with her son to the c.] 

 No time to explore the combinations available with FAVORITA.  But this
does look like a case where Glosa has crossed the grammar barrier, with
FAVORI the usual substantive word, and FAVORITA acting more like an
adjective, in particular.

>  ... So if I were selecting words
>for a Romance-based interlingua with a consonant-vowel-consonant-vowel
>word-shape, FAVO would be the obvious choice. 
*   I like FAVO, and could see it take the place of both FAVORI and
FAVORITA, while it is a ready-made post-fix.  However, either for inertia,
or a hunch that Ron and Wendy's first choice was usually the right one, I
would vote to stay with the "Glosa 6000" situation ... unless, of course, a
properly constituted panel was set up, with generally agreed criteria, to
rationalise the language.

Note that we get all >likely

*  I remain wary of the hard and fast rule, and rely more on human

Yes, that's what I think is needed for a modern and "scientific" Glosa.

That's an ad-hoc unreproducible result, good for a sample or experiment,
but a public method explains "how" and ensures continuity into the future.
Roget's is great, but even it has undergone subsequent revisions.

Exactly. Glosa has not taken off yet because it isn't ready.
When a set of rules can be clearly formulated then we'll see ...

I have informally described a method that selects nearly the same roots as
those of Occidental and Novial and both Interlinguas. It is not a weakness
to agree with (verify) the results of the past experts. But now it can be
done in an automatic way. It would be possible to select *any* set of
source languages and derive the common roots; I prefer Romance, but
Germanic or Greco-Latin or "Dravido-Sanscrit" can work the same way.

> New forms:-

> will probably be longer than the present range of Glosa words,

Yes, but it still gives me a headache. Is it FAVO or FAVOR or FAVORI?
Too many clashes with the short forms, too-long compounds with long,
and neither is memorable because of the arbitrary final vowel.
The authors failed to determine a consistent form for this concept.

There will certainly be words like ABIL ATIV ATOR ACION etc for
the basic compounds; FAVOR-ABIL sounds better than FAVO-ABILI.
But word-shape is mostly independent of word-selection.

> and a decision taken by a suitable panel of adjudicators (of
> possibly five people).

All the little detailed decisions must be done by an algorithm,
and all the big design issues must be decided by agreement among
the Glosa "committee". Otherwise it can't realistically happen.

> greso = walk; gres-abili = walkable
> kapital = capital; kapital-ismo

> Some find the hyphen unworkable, unpronouncable

> I believe that they ought to be hyphenated.

I see no problem with this, or with deleting the hyphen whenever
the components are bisyllabic. I'm not sure if any roots need to
be other than bisyllabic. Note that words like FAVI and FAVO
cannot drop their final vowels in a compound without clashing.

They aren't affixes if they can stand alone as individual words.
Then we can say: "Glosa has no morphology, just compounding."
(To match up with: "Glosa has no grammar, just word-order.")
The -BO -PE etc monstrosities must be exterminated, of course.

Agreed. I only intended the list to demonstrate how to discover the basic
"concept" or root. Of course we can also use it to explore derivatives.

Another option is also possible: derive Mega-Glosa exactly according to
its description by the authors, which would seem to include all the
"international" words of the Romance languages. All roads lead back
toward using computer programs to generate vocabulary by agreed rules.

*  IE Like LsF.  This would considerably expedite the formation of Glosa
Appendices produced by experts in Special Interest Areas and in Technical
Fields --- IF SUCH A SYSTEM CAN BE DEVISED.

>But, I am afraid that after latinization of the language we will >have to

rules of word-making (e.g. means for suffixes >etc.). But then Glosa will
become just another 'euroDolly'.
*  Well the problem of the triangle between Source Language, Phonetic
Spelling, and Standardisation Within Glosa did exercise Ron Clark's
imagination.
   There is no simple rule that ^juggles these three balls^, so some
higher-level approximation is required.  While the original "Glossa" was an
excellent reference for technical experts checking out Classical roots, it
proved to lack the auxilliary language requirement of standardisation in
its phonetical spelling.
   It was somewhat painful for me to watch, as Ron and Wendy tried out
different combinations and permutations in trying to get Source, Phonetics
and Spelling all to match.  Eventually there was a nice distinction made:-
  Letters used to spell Glosa words had a standard pronunciation;
  Sounds in Glosa words did not necessarily have a one-to-one
     relationship with letters used.
  EG  EKSTASI = ecstacy;  EXAKTI = exact;  EXCEPTI = except
 pron. AY-kst-AR-s-EE (AY-xt-AR-s-EE);
       AY-x-AR-kt-EE  (AY-ks-AR-kt-EE);
       AY-x-CH-AY-pt-EE

  Sometimes, a number of different spellings for one word were tried: my
favourite is what finally resulted as the Glosa word for "science", SKIENCE
 pron. sk-EE-AY-n-CH-AY
  N.B. The Gaskell system for pronunciation of Glosa spelling is in the
Public Domain: it's not neat, but uses only the computer keyboard (ASCII);
and has an unbeatable logic:-
  Standard consonants with a one-letter/one-sound relationship are shown
using lower case, viz. b d f g h j k l m n p r s t v w x z.
  Complex consonants are shown as upper case pairs, viz. CH KW EE
for  c  q  y  correspondingly.
  Vowels are shown as upper case pairs, viz. AR AY EE OR OO.
  Consonant cluster, of standard consonants, are shown ajacently.
  Vowels and complex consonants, which are all shown as upper case pairs,
are separated using hyphens.

  Of course, this all assumes that people will know how to pronounce the
written letters: needless to say, many won't.  So, for the teaching of
spoken Glosa, we will need to provide the sounds in some technical format:
but note that many parts of the Third World do not even have access to a
cassette player!
  Even on Glosalist, we have not yet moved up to choosing a standard file
format for the transmission of sounds (as attachments) through email, or as
demonstrations of pronunciation on Glosa websites.  Please correct me if I
err on this one.
  Of the few Glosa cassettes I have sent out via land-post, I have got the
feedback that my pronunciation of Glosa is very 'English.'  Such cassettes
are, of course, free to Glosalist subscribers: please ask, sending your
land-address.  I urge Glosa-pe to create their own cassettes as examples of
spoken Glosa, and for these to be made available to others on a
cost+postage basis.
  My feeling is that, regarding the actual speaking of Glosa - and the
teaching of this - considerably more work is needed.

  So, for newbies, if I can use such a term, I would revise the
pronunciation story:-
   Vowels have only one sound, and are pronounced as in Italian;
   Consonants have "standard" European pronuciation .. but this needs
clarification ...
     b d f k l m n p t v   - all fairly standard

     g h r s x    -   all with hard pronunciation    

     c as CH(Italian), j as Y(hard), r preferably 'rolled', 
     y as I(Italian), z as S(hard) 

     w not used - except for proper nouns EG William, Wollongong

*   While I can easily use the 'abbreviation', "Classical," to cover words
from both Latin and Greek sources, this is a bit dishonest, because there
is no clear alignment between the sound/
spelling representation of words from these two sources.
    It was the compounding of a lexicon from these languages, each with its
own system of pronunciation and writing, that caused the Glosa authors to
rethink the rules of sound/sight standardisation, as they applied to Glosa.
    However, I do think the Glosa authors managed the miracle, and produced
an auxilliary language embodying the Classical roots.  Our job might be to
tweak it a little: producing a basic one-concept/one-word introductory
vocabulary, with no synonyms; and a more complete lexicon with allowed
(non-clashing) synonyms - though with only one from Greek and one from Latin.

>Your examples from dics. are right. Maybe we should find an >algorythm for
derivations from Latin <<and Greek!?>>, but it's a >difficult job. And it

*  A written set of instructions .. as I have demonstrated for the Gaskell
Pronunciation System for Glosa .. could work, incorporating both Greek and
Latin sources; however, I worry about complete mechanisation by computer.  
   Though, taking our limitations of manpower into account, running Greek
and Latin dicionaries through a program, which incorporates the
hypothesised algorithm, might be the only way for us to produce a complete
Glosa lexicon .. for implementation in, say, 2020.
   Such a mechanised system would cover the majority of words, but ^topping
and tailing^ would be needed for tricky cases, and for the checking of both
clashes and excessive synonyms.

    Suspect that beginning with an existing euro-language would represent
two steps back to make one step forwards.
    Yes, there is considerable latitude within and between the
euro-languages, and it was the thought that a fine line could be drawn
between these varied forms, that drove both Hogben and Clark.  Ron did
worry that there was too much work to be completed in one life-time, and
Glosa's present incomplete state bears this out.

*  I believe that a solid set of Glosa word-building rules ought to be
better than adopting either those of Greek or Latin.
   Re "favourable", there were about three rules deduced for the formation
of such Glosa equivalent compound words:-
     . Each root-word maintains its integrity;
     . Post-fix modifiers are roots, or their standard abbreviations;
     . Where there are adjacent vowels, that of the first root-word is
dropped;
     . And, yes, to maintain root integrity in written form, hyphens are
used. 
   Compounding:-
         FAVORI                        - present Glosa root
                ABILI                  - root used as post-fix
             (I)                       - drop vowel from first root
               -                       - form compound using hyphen

         FAVOR-ABILI                   - passes ear, tongue, and eye tests  
                            (sounds good, easy to say, can see its make-up)

   And, yes, we definitely are not ready, yet, to front up to the UN with
Glosa in its present incomplete form.

*  Possibly the easiest path - starting with preponderantly Latin roots - 
but it gets away from Ron Clark's original plan of creating a world

*  There is a strong case for providing people with a learners'
"pedestrian" language, that covers enough of some every-day activity, like
shopping or letter-writing, to provide them with a working environment in
which they can play with sentence formation in a non-challenging way.  Such
a specialised learning dictionary would allow people to gain confidence in
using Glosa about some common area of life.  As a means by which learners
might achieve fluency in using the language, this allows them to do so
while only having to internalise a limited vocabulary.

* Karo Sid,

 I write in English, because it is not your story in Glosa that causes me
to ask questions, but your intent.

 I see that you experiment with dropping capitals, and with some changes
in spelling.  However I was not sure about the function of the letters in
brackets.  Perhaps they were noun or verb indicators.

Actually, I do not know which cultures do not capitalise, except, perhaps
the Chinese.  However, For most who would read stories in collections of
Glosa works, my guess is that the majority of them would like to see
normal European sentence structure.

</fontfamily>

As a plot, I was not convinced of the wise old man's sagacity: he
certainly found a way of solving both of their problems: Jako's by dying
of lightning, and his by ridding himself of Jako.  But I question the
reader satisfaction in such a story; I certainly was not happy with the
resolution of the crisis in the plot.  Would this story give the right
impression to your average primary-school child?  Is there more to the
story, perhaps a happy ending?  I just feel that, as stories go, it is
only half finished.


Possibly I would get the whole message if I saw it in the English
language version.  However, I would enjoy working on it with you,
rounding out the plot, and, generally, leaving the reader with a pleasant
smile on his face.  While I was tempted to go through your Glosa making
suggestions, I felt that the broader concept of the tale was where I
would do most good.


Saluta,

   You have the very happy ability of collecting your thoughts using a
small lexicon.  Your example equals that of a learner, who develops
facility with a language by practising with only one thousand words.
   Sadly, I do not have this ability, and got bored from frequently using
the same words.  When the "Glosa 6000" dictionary arrived, I got very
happy, and very much enjoyed using many new words.

*  There is a conflict of interests here.  Charles is thinking in the long
view of general communication, and has official research results to back
him up; whereas Kevin is going for the jugular, and communicating in Glosa,
happily, within a narrow range of concepts.
   While I understand that both dictionary-building and easy-going use of a
new language are both essential facets of its success, I have to side with
Kevin, who has opted for fluency over over using the new medium for broader
discussion.
   When I first started with Glosa, I was too afraid of making mistakes to
get on with tentative first sentences.  I now know that the pattern of the
language - syntactically - is the foundation stone of use.  Once we are
happily confident that we are putting the words in the right place, then,
more complex conceptual use comes with the addition of new vocabulary, and
well-formed complex sentences grow from the pattern of well-formed simple
ones we started with.

   Briefly, I believe that we have to start with ---

       U feli pa sed epi u tapita.

--- before we move on to the more complex  ...

       kron un hora-me pa sono tri hora, Profesori Taxiko pa 
nota ke an melano e leuko ge-stria feli pa du sed epi an favorita, e fo
preci, tapita ex Iran.

*  Well,
   I feel you are going about the matter of linking words with
letter-groups from the wrong direction.
   Taking the FAMx words and treating them like a group seems a 'letter
first' approach.  I am more in tune with the Clark approach, of looking at
the list of concepts and meanings, and finding the most suitable Classical
roots to act as their symbols - in an a-posteori sort of way.
   But there must be something about the "fam" sound because it is close to
some very basic human motives and drives:-
     family, humger and fame.

   Then, as Ron and Wendy found out, as they tried to add new words to the
lexicon, there are physical limits to the possible number of words, if each
concept is to have a unique written symbol.
   They found it was necessary to permit words which differed only in their
terminal vowel, and they decided that longer words would be needed, as the
dictionary grew.  They even printed some words with different meanings but
identical spellings.
   Also, they intensified efforts to build hyphenated compounds, which was
a rather strong element of Hogben's work.
 
   In Glosa 6000, the FAMx group is varied enough to avoid confusion, with
different word-lengths and actual letters after the first three.
    FAMILI       family  [people with whom we are most familiar]
    FAMILIARI    familiar, familiarity  [people we treat like family]
    FAMINA       hunger  [in need of mother's cooking]
    FAMO         fame  [success we'd like to brag about to the oldies]
   
   As other FAMx concept words crop up, they can be added: there's still a
place for -Ax, -Ex and Ux after the first three.  However, I believe that
the use of Auxilliary Verbs, Verboids and Generics do broaden the range of
meaning possible.

   How does the ease of pronunciation story go?  Italians usually terminate
words with a vowel and ? the French with consonants?

*  W and Y have gone, and J gets minimal use.  However the K/C divide seems
very useful to me; and it is very handy to have Q for 'query' words; while
X amnd Z add exotic flavour.  As well as that, for physical reasons we do
need enough letters to allow the vocab to grow in size, without forcing new
words to become excessively long.

possibly becomes a 9000-word dictionary.

*  This all sounds like the idea of a different word for everything.  The
strength of Glosa's lexicon is in each word operating like an un-inflected
concept-centre; but also the idea of compounding permits a radical
multiplication of actual concepts available for use.  Rather than in
pushing for an increase in the number of words in the Glosa lexicon, I
would prefer to see our concentrating on building the compounding power of
each root-word.

Very well put. I feel exactly the same way. In fact, my
unofficial core word list currently maps 1221 Glosa roots
to 4149 English words.

Unfortunately, I still must rely on G6000 when reading
Glosa written by other people, because there is no
agreement on the core words of the language, and/or because
people choose to use words outside the core for some
reason.

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com

--part1_164.6ed442c.296f0f7f_boundary

It seems to me that a verb phrase tends to embrace two concepts, an action 
and the time when the action occured. The time concept includes the past, 
present and future tenses signalled in Glosa by "pa", "fu" and "nu", the 
duration short or long "he lives here", "he stopped suddenly" - "du" and 
continuity "he used to visit" etc " he sometimes comes" - "plu-kron". I find 
that if the time is clearly signalled, itis much easier to pick out the verb 
phrase and also the subject otherwise sentences can be very muddled for me. I 
suggested that we put this signal at the beginning of the phrase to clarify 
the phrase's division from each other and that we could use the time or 
adverbial part of the phrase here. The use of this method is entirely 
voluntary and was not meant to be considered a reform of Glosa as it is in  
fact  already in use "pa akti". I experimented with "du" for the want of an 
alternative and PGN has "nu-du". Now, as the time has 3 possibilities, "pa", 
"nu" and "fu" the "nu" could be omitted provided that some other signal is 
present such as "du". Most verbs perhaps are continuous and indicate a 
reasonable length so we could prune the suggestion I have given earlier to:-
"pa", "du", "fu" and "plu-kron" with "nu", "du" and my rather clumsy " no-du" 
being only used if really necessary.
 Again I want to point out that none of these suggestions constitute reforms 
and need not be followed. However, some Glosa sentences, I find very 
difficult to decypher at times and I think it not unreasonable that I don't 
spend a long time trying. Those difficult sentences I would describe as

<HTML><FONT FACE=arial,helvetica><FONT  SIZE=2>It seems to me that a verb phrase tends to embrace two concepts, an action and the time when the action occured. The time concept includes the past, present and future tenses signalled in Glosa by "pa", "fu" and "nu", the duration short or long "he lives here", "he stopped suddenly" - "du" and continuity "he used to visit" etc " he sometimes comes" - "plu-kron". I find that if the time is clearly signalled, itis much easier to pick out the verb phrase and also the subject otherwise sentences can be very muddled for me. I suggested that we put this signal at the beginning of the phrase to clarify the phrase's division from each other and that we could use the time or adverbial part of the phrase here. The use of this method is entirely voluntary and was not meant to be considered a reform of Glosa as it is in &nbsp;fact &nbsp;already in use "pa akti". I experimented with "du" for the want of an alternative and PGN has "nu-du". Now, as the time has 3 possibilities, "pa", "nu" and "fu" the "nu" could be omitted provided that some other signal is present such as "du". Most verbs perhaps are continuous and indicate a reasonable length so we could prune the suggestion I have given earlier to:-
<BR>"pa", "du", "fu" and "plu-kron" with "nu", "du" and my rather clumsy " no-du" being only used if really necessary.
<BR> Again I want to point out that none of these suggestions constitute reforms and need not be followed. However, some Glosa sentences, I find very difficult to decypher at times and I think it not unreasonable that I don't spend a long time trying. Those difficult sentences I would describe as belonging to an inadequate IAL.

 For a while there I thought we had a number of refinements and
standardisations in vocabulary on the drawing board.
    However, I found it ten times easier to consult a printed dictionary,
than keying through an electronic word-list, so, although I have
participated in a desynonymising program, I now find it much easier to
simply check out "Glosa 6000" than switch on the computer.

  is a straight-forward exposition of the tense situation; and it basically

   The   du kurso =/= runs   is a bit tricky to disambiguate, but basically
a well written sentence does not need VERB markers if it is in the Present
Tense.  The use of "u" or "plu", if no other markers are present to show
the Noun Phrases, should be sufficient to separate the ^sheep^ from the

be Verb Phrases.

 1. Zamenhof took his hand ^off the tiller^ and it worked for Esperanto.  I
wish to work as part of a loose assemblage, but under the 'patronage' of
Wendy Ashby.

 2. Neither.  Glosa went through a series of small, progressive changes
from 1981 to 1992: this was very desabilising, but each change strengthened
the language.  An overhaul is needed to standardise the printed
dictionaries; however, although it might involve a lot of work, I would not
envisage it as a 'major overhaul.'#

# I am now the proud owner of a laser printer - still in it's box.
  Were an agreed revision of the lexicon to emerge, and different levels of
dictionary to be decided upon, then, I would print such dictionaries,
virtually free, and this would remove the problem of cost, which has
deterred Wendy from revising the printmasters for the existing Glosa
publications.

That's what I'm suggesting, along with a method to discover that list,
by using a strict reproducible public method rather than by an appeal
to authority. Rather than a hand-picked artlang, a systematic auxlang.

Varied to the point of raggedness, and un-mnemonic, but the same roots;
this is a confirmation that Glosa's "concepts" can be found by algorithm.

It looks as if neither pure CVCV nor CVCVN will work in all cases,
but by allowing either, as appropriate, it might work out ok ...
Words like CURA are probably better than CURAR, but FAMIN beats FAMINA.
I'm still unconvinced as to what word-shape is best, but one needs
to select (by a neutral algorithm) the concepts first, anyway.

As far as pronunciation is concerned, French has very little stress
and is syllable-timed, German is the opposite. Yet there is a middle
position that can work out for everyone. Simply use internationally
familiar spellings and then pronunciation follows naturally.

I did a check of letter frequencies, and the Q X Z are so rare
and difficult to differentiate (for most of the world's speakers)
their added flavor is unwelcome. The fewer letters, the better.
The hard/soft C/G issue is best solved by simply allowing either.

I don't think so; it's around 6000 total based on what I've seen.
My current list of cognates is 7000 but many are mere inflections
(abdomen/abdominal). I'm making a list of English inflected forms
because I can't find it anywhere on the web ... maybe someone
could assist by providing one?

> This all sounds like the idea of a different word for everything.

Quite the contrary. I'm staying within Glosa's use of basic roots
("concept words") and relying on compounding of those roots to
replace *all* inflections. The fact that several different methods
converge to the same result is encouraging, not threatening.

Of course it can -- one uses (selects from) the international vocabulary.
Look for the meaning in several source languages and take the most common.
This is easy using a computer and a few semi-decent bilingual word lists.

Specify the steps in English, then anybody can write a program for it.
I'm currently using 8 wordlists from wordgumbo.com and writing simple
Perl scripts to process them, with good results. It's so easy to update
or revise an interlanguage that is based on living languages ...

Impossible, manually. Specify the rules and let the computer carry them out.

The 3rd point won't work, because you confuse different roots
that happen to differ only in the terminal vowel.

We are not going to define the vocabulary of science, scientists will.
There is no way to keep up with their constant revisions, either.
Anglo-Romance is tractable, easy, and popular.

So make a frequency count of Glosa words actually used, and
put the top-1000 in BOLD TYPE. This is a long-ago-solved problem.

I find this extremely interesting, and would like to hear
more. I sometimes have trouble reading Syd's writing, but
(I think) that's mostly because he tends to use more words
from G1000 and PGN, whereas I am more familiar with (and
write with) the GID core words.

So I can certainly see how someone would have trouble
reading the work of one of us, but can't immediately think
of how someone would have trouble with both. 

When I do have trouble reading Glosa, it is usually because
of one of the following:
1. Use of unfamiliar vocabulary (e.g. G6000)
2. Difficulty identifying noun-phrase/verb-phrase
boundaries
3. Language idioms or word-for-word translations (usually
out of English, it seems)

My primary goal when I write in Glosa is that it be
understandable by anyone who has even a minimal exposure to
Glosa structure. So if I'm not achieving that goal, I would
definitely appreciate any suggestions that might improve
the readability of my writing. Examples would be especially
helpful, but I'll accept generalities as well.

Kevin

Mainly the punctuation and some of the experimental things.
Also the weird AOL mailer settings do get in the way.
But it helps that you clearly mark the verb phrases.

Yes, that's the major problem. The syntax falls apart.

The authors of Glosa have this problem, but most people
on this list are aware of it and minimize occurances.

I'm reposting a portion of my message with a different
subject, at the request of a couple people.

I should also take this chance to mention that when I refer
to various viewpoints below, I generally try to refer to
them without mentioning my own beliefs. Those of you who
follow the list can certainly guess where I stand, but I'm
definitely not trying to disparage any particular group.
These are all valid views, and the question is which one(s)
are best for Glosa.

Let's parse this sentence into English, marking the start
of the verb phrase with [VP]. First, let's assume that we
are in the noun as long as possible...

A big, black, canine, chasing trio [VP] smalls cats.

Hmm...that didn't seem to work. Let's try switching to the
verb as early as possible:

The big (thing) [VP] blackly, dogishly, chases three small
cats.

Not much better. Maybe it's:

The big blackness [VP] dogishly chases three small cats.

Or

The big black dogish chase [VP] threes...no, I guess not.

As you can see, it is not a trivial exercise to figure out
where the verb starts. Yes, it seems that you can
eventually figure it out, at least with the samples that
have been posted to the list.

But if you're trying to read quickly, you've just lost your
flow, and have to re-start the sentence (and perhaps the
paragraph) to get going again.

Thus, the simple solution that Syd and I have grown to
love:

U mega melano kanis du casa tri pusi felis.

Or, for extra clarity, but probably not helpful in this
particular sentence:

U mega melano kanis du casa plu tri pusi felis.

This sounds reasonable in principle, but I'm not sure
exactly what it means. And I'm not sure how the loose
assemblage would work. I guess I have to ask what it would
take to get Wendy on email. Is it a hardware issue, or the
monthly ISP fees, or the hourly telecom charge, or
something else?

So, if I understand you correctly, we would be looking at
the langauge roughly as it stands today. We might add a few
small helper words, finish normalizing the vocabulary based
on Wendy's notes, and perhaps we might adjust some portion
of other words, but more on the order of altering 50 core
words, rather than 500. 

Is that kind of what you're thinking? How do other people
on the list feel about that direction?

Kevin

Many people hate it, that Glosa uses a semicolon ";" to separate
clauses.  Yes, it is different to the languages we know and we are
used to.  But, as I understood it, it gives Glosa the possibility
to SEPARATE PHRASES with a COMMA ","!  I know, it is again a thing,
we are not used to, but please note, that we all also are not used 
to a radical isolating language like Glosa. 

Frase de Robin 2002-01-10:
 >   U mega melano kanis   /     casa     /  tri pusi felis.
U mega melano kanis, casa, tri pusi felis.

(Sorry, perhaps bad English ...)

U mega kanis voci, casa, teri felis.
  (The voice of the big dog chases the frightening cat.)
  [perhaps better: ... u teri felis.]
U mega kanis, voci, teri felis.
  (The big dog bellows at the frightening cat.)
  [Not always easy to find the verb in English as well, I think.] 
U mega kanis casa, teri, felis.
  (The chase of the big dog frightens the cat.)

How does it look?  And more important: Does it work?  I think, it is
better than creating a new 
  simple-present-begin-of-verbal-phrase-marker-particle.
Kevin's trick of using continuous tense (du) gives another acceptable 
possibility of course, but in my feeling continuous tense is a specific 
English phenomenon.

People always have accents when they speak a foreign language,
e.g. only once I hear on TV an English-speaker, who had no
English accent in Russian. But it was a professor-slavist! Other
English-speakers, who speak Russian have bad pronunciation. But I
can understand them!
About examples of pronunciation of mebmers of our list I am
writing a next letter.

comas and semicolons break up the flow of glosa and make it ugly and jerky. 
"ke" is smooth and graceful where clauses need to signalled but joined. the 
full stop breaks the flow where we need a break so that our minds can sort 
out the syntax and meaning of the previous sentence, a comma, when needed, 
shows that a phrase is not part of the main SVO structure. The stop and comma 
are logical and useful, I feel strongly; the semi colon is not appropriate.

My current semi-Glossa list has 4192 "concept words" of which
only 49 contain the letter Z. There is no good-enough reason

Try the annotated list on Marcel's web page. I have a list of 8000 or so lexis.

Glosa should stay with standard international punctuation. But see below ...

All languages mark verbs for aspect (complete or incomplete) somehow,
though English uses several inconsistent methods. This aspect marker
must precede the verb, and so also indicates the S-V boundary.
But some languages prefer to explicitly mark tense instead of aspect ...
this can be tolerated in Glosa by offering 5 particles, one or more
of which will *always* precede the verb: PA NU FU for tense, and DU ??
for aspect. I assume the missing "perfective" particle is HA; we have
discussed this previously and perhaps decided on something else.
I think this is much better than PA-NU, FU-FU, PA-PA, etc.

PA = simple past tense
NU = simple present tense
FU = simple future tense
DU = imperfect, continuous, durative aspect
HA = perfect, completive aspect

PA HA = past perfect
NU HA = present perfect
FU HA = future perfect
PA DU = past imperfect
NU DU = present imperfect
FU DU = future imperfect

> comas and semicolons break up the flow of glosa and make it ugly and jerky.

KE is perfect to begin a clause, but what terminates it? I think the authors
meant to (or should ...) say that the weird semicolon *terminates* a clause.
But maybe it would be better to have an explicit particle for that, like SO.

could you give us some english examples for the list of particles you 
suggest? I'm not too sure of the verb terminology - it seems to have changed 
since I was at school! The particles sound a distinct possibility.
I'm toying with the idea that G may need a word to give sound to punctuation, 
rather like the old fashioned "stop" in telegrams..... "MUST GO STOP WIFE 
JUST RETURNED". In English we signal a stop by falling in pitch and then 
starting the next sentence high in some dialects that is. In other languages 
there are presumably different signals.
In glosa comma these signals are not available semicolon they would not coma 
perhaps coma work stop

Saluta!
Reading texts in Glosa, I found that I'm not sure how to use
adverbs.
They are used in places: before verb, before verb with hyphen,
after verb, after objects of verb.
Which way is correct?

Unfortunately there is an article (see below) in the new issue of "Plu
Glosa Nota", where Wendy complains about people writing her letters
with "ke".  She seemed to be quite angry about "ke".

This is sad, because we have an agreement on glosalist, that we want
to have the "ke" or at least permit the possibility of "ke".  I
remember Syd, Robin, Nick, Kevin, Charles and me.  There are
certainly more.  I got also an e-mail from the linguist Dr. Fischer, who
sees the need of "ke".  So "ke" must be in our internet dictionary.
On the other hand Wendy's approval to our internet dictionary is
important, because once, when our dictionary is stable, we should make
a printed version and persuade Wendy, to take her errorfull lists from
the market.  (Well, only this reason made me start the effort with the
"Similar Synonyms" and her suggestions.  Otherwise I would have let it
be, there have been preferences already, though not hers.)

It would be great, if somebody would write a reader's letter to
PGN, that "ke" is necessary.  I will do so, too.  (Wendy Ashby,
Glosa Education Organisation, P.O. Box 18, Richmond Surrey,
TW9 2GE, Great Britain.)

I just saw, that there is an error in my computer program.  "ke" should
have been in the Core-version.  I just fixed it provisorily.

> could you give us some english examples
> for the list of particles you suggest?

Starting from http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/tenses.htm
we can see that all the tenses/aspects are combinations of
just a few (5) particles.

PA/NU/FU are supposed to be the past/present/future tenses,
but some people confuse NU/DU; DU is supposed to indicate
continued but unfinished action, somewhat like English "-ing",
so it is more properly called an "aspect" rather than "tense".

There is a second aspect, somewhat like English "-ed",
indicating completed or "perfected" action; this I assumed
to be the missing "HA" in Glosa, but it seems Robin prefers
"PRA" which isn't exactly the same ...

An FU gresi.      He WILL walk.          future tense
An PA gresi.      He DID walk.           past tense
An NU gresi.      He NOW walks.          present tense
An DU gresi.      He walkING.            imperfect aspect
An HA gresi.      He walkED.             perfect aspect

OK, the last 2 are slightly ungrammatical in English, but
it's the idea. Using just the bare aspects, one ignores
the tense -- most Asian languages work this way. They can
be combined to give more precision:

An FU DU gresi.   He will be walking.    future imperfect
An NU DU gresi.   He is walking.         present imperfect
An PA DU gresi.   He was walking.        past imperfect
An FU HA gresi.   He will have walked.   future perfect
An NU HA gresi.   He has walked.         present perfect
An PA HA gresi.   He had walked.         past perfect

This account follows the ideas of Bickerton about creoles.
One could also explore "moods" here; there are a minimum
of 2, the "realis" and "irrealis". Another time, maybe ...

This all sounds reasonable to me. I would support adding HA
and adjusting the other meanings as necessary to match
this.

But does that mean we have to specify nu-kron or nu-tem
whenever we want to refer to now? It doesn't seem like nu
can serve both purposes for us if it becomes so important
as a verb marker.

Suddenly everyone is talking about "Central Glosa", which I
don't remember hearing about before. Is it the predecessor
of G6000?

I now accept the semi-colon, at least for written
communication. Which, for the foreseeable future, will be
the dominant method for Glosa. 

The only thing I don't like about 'ke' is that it is
similar to 'qe'.

I don't like this. Perhaps because it's just too different
from what I am used to. I often use commas to separate
adjectives, so the sentence above would be very confusing
to me.

.wav. What other options are there?

No.

Probably sentences out of 18 steps or the Glosa Basic

I believe my list has 18 roots containing Z (out of 1221).
I think we _could_ drop it without much damage, but it's
not causing trouble for me so I'm not sure why we would
drop it. 

I would rather drop Q (16 roots), X (40 roots), and W (zero
roots) first.

I guess I have to ask the purpose of this current effort.
If these are words that were used on this list, but which
don't appear in any standard Glosa word list, then I would
disregard them as typos.

Here's my frequency list, showing percentage of words (concept words or roots,
no inflected forms) containing each letter. I think anything less than 5% is a
candidate for possible deletion/replacement. Killing 8 letters, just because
Romance doesn't use them much anymore, seems radical ... and correct.

e       .477
a       .462
r       .456
i       .410
o       .362

b       .109

Bonus! Those of you who have suffered through this
get some free software! Assuming you have Perl:

while ($line = <>) {
   while ($line =~ s/(\S+)//) {
      $word = $1;
      $total ++;
      while ($word =~ m/(.)/) {

There are some listening examples on my website.
  http://www.glosa.org/en/audi.htm .

They are recorded with "Microsoft Sound Recorder" (Ver. 1996), which
is part of my Windows 95.  Unfortunately this simple program is
limited to a recording time of 1 minute.  So, the dialog between the
Glosa authors Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby is not complete and there is
only the first of three stanzas of Gary's cowboy song.  I know, I 
should install a better program, but I need it too seldom.

Then the files have been compressed with "Layer-3 Producer
(Professional) v1.1b1 (Fraunhofer)".  This program is free, and I
think, it is very good (small and effective).  There are newsgroups,
where they exchange mp3-files, and I am annoyed, that there they often
do not use a compression program like this.

I would like to add a listening example spoken by a Russian speaker.
Russians pronounce consonant clusters very easily.  They are perfect in
the thrilled R.  And - I think this is very important for Glosa - they
separate the words clearly (not e.g. as the Frenchs).

I would like to have a text spoken by a Romance speaker (Spanish,
Italian, Portuguese), too.  (Ent I myselff shoutt speeck a text, I
ssink - don't be afraid, not in English, in Glosa of course.)

Please send me compressed mp3-files or uncompressed wav-files.  If you
can, put them temporarily on a website and give me the address.  My
Italian e-mail provider is not fit for the download of very large
mails.  I also need a photo of you, and a typed version of the text you
speak.

"glosa.org" cannot become a multi-media site with hours of sound and
films.  The webspace directly under the domain "glosa.org" is now
limited to 6 MB, and I have 5.1 MB in use already.  If I want to use
more, I would have to pay for it more (no!) or I put some files on free
webspace on another server (yes!).

I agree.  Perhaps I have been misunderstood here.

I would not remove Q and X from the existing texts and vocabulary
lists.  I would rather make a new roule 

  "You are allowed to use kv instead of q, ks instead of x."

... and then look what happens.

There was a very good example in the latest PGN - "U developo de energi-ma 
teknika nu-du tako advanti in Islanda" ( my spellings are wrong in places - 
my memory is not good but that won't matter). The verb phrase is "nu-du" 
intro words, "tako" adverb, "advanti"(? = advance) verb/head word in phrase, 
"in Islanda" adverbial/prepostion phrase fuctioning as adverb.
so:- intro word, simple adverb(s), head verb, preposition phrase acting as 
adverb.
With a sentence's verb phrase, as it is the only VP, the adverbs can be in 
varied places:- quickly, in Iceland, It advances - it advances quickly in 
Iceland etc. Unfortunately, Glosa, quite rightly, pruned off the "ly" and 
decided that "tako" could mean a speed, speeding, speedy, speedily or to 
speed. This makes things a little difficult but with a bit of preposition 
juggling we could have "ko take" =with speed.

perhaps write "qu" and pronounce the "q" like "k" but further back in the

If my experiments and investigations have caused disharmony, I apologise. 

but ....

If there are such things as good glosa and bad glosa, we need a set of 
recomendations to make clear which is which.
It is wrong to use "ke" but correct to use ";". When?   Should it replace the 
Engish conjuction "that" when  it to occurs?
What rules govern the use of capitals? Do we follow the English, French, 
German or what? If we use "meno tri" or "meno-tri" does the latter have a 
capital or the former perhaps 2 capitals?

  [-- Kevin once complained, that there is so much advertising for
the expensive GEO-books on my website http://www.glosa.org and that
it seems that one has to buy most of them, if he wants to get access 
to the language.
  Now I just removed this into a new file.  There I wrote also two
sentences about the book "Central Glosa".  Please visit
  http://www.glosa.org/en/bibli.htm .
I hope, my main page is now easier to survey and has improved a

Glosa is a linguistically naive auxlang. I'm sure the authors
were unfamiliar with the writings of Peano, Wahl, Jesperson, etc.
It's still interesting to me as the only well-known creole-ish
auxlang, but relative clauses don't/can't work the way they thought.
And the use of anything other than the internationally familiar
puctuation, would be just plain foolish. There is one problem
with KE, that it can be confused with the Q-question words.
Somebody should do a table of "correlatives" for Glosa;
the contrast with Occidental's would be glaring.

We should use different terms for the different types of adverbs ...

1. SLIGHTLY big dog ... modifies the adjective "big"

As far as I know, Glosa has no mechanism for this other than context.
Somehow this seems acceptable within a noun phrase.

2. dog runs QUICKLY ... modifies the verb "runs"

We can use "KO-" to replace English "-ly" here, I agree this is
better than confusing the verb phrase by putting it in there.

*   Well, I know that the language must work for the majority, or it's
not working: so, some people like explicit staements of function, and
this must be allowed for.  

    And if people feel a Verb Phrase marker is needed, then the rest, who
don't, will happily read around it.  I guess the problem arises when
'signpoters' read unmarked sentences, and can't decide where to mentally
'take a breath' between phrases.


    However, seriously, people are not computers: we don't have to work
with faultless, unthinking logic.  In my attempted demo sentence, I still
believe it has to be a "dog chases cats" story.


    While I am not usually a fan of William of Occam, ("When there are a
number of possible solutions to a problem, the obvious one is most likely
to be the right one.") in the understanding of pedestrian utterance, I am
an Occamist.  So, basically, was Ron Clark.  He often said that people
have a body of experience and understanding between them: thus the
listener (or reader) goes halfway towards the speaker (or writer), who
only says as much as is needed for communication to occur; otherwise,
were he to doggedly ^cross every 'T' and dot every 'I'^, conversation
would become boringly long, and correspondingly uninteresting.  ... or,
Ron said something like that. 


  As ^trainer wheels^, when learning Glosa, in every sentence we might
"U" every 'noun', and "PA" every past 'verb' - as I did  once.  It is my
suspicion that the use of "DU" as a 'verb' marker - ostensibly
'continuising' every action - is a similar case of gaining confidence as
you ^get Glosa rolling.^  While this might not be the case, and for some
people, ~du~ becomes the norm, it could indicate one of the differences
between people .. and how we think.

*  My belief is that both schools of thought can get along with one
another, and will either learn to tolerate each other, or might reach a
blend-point, where non-signposters, recognising the need for some
declaration of the verb function, play the ~du~ in sticky patches, while
regular users of the ~du~, will acknowlege that, in some of their
sentences, the word symbolising the action is so @#$%&* obvious, that a
~du~ might be superfluous.  Please pardon my 'comic book' expletive.


*  But, as to the way Kevin is ^pushing the language into funny shapes^,
I would suggest that these are all odd, and non-Occam, usages of either
Glosa or English.  So I go through Kevin's odd-syntax sentences, marking
the singularities in colour: those whose systems lack colour, will just
have to imagine it, when they see strange coding:-


>Let's parse this sentence into English, marking the start

*  This is precisely my reason for giving those three-line examples:
Glosa (line 1), word-for-word glos into English, to show the syntax (line
2), and the Glosa sentence rendered into                 vernacular
English (line 3).  It is the critical middle line that many people do not
understand; and, only when I started using it, myself, did I start moving
with developing the ability to 'think in Glosa.'  


   Seeking Feedback:  Did my use of "it's raining ^cats and dogs^" -type
markers, for most of my non-literal language sequences, aid your
understanding of the above?  Is the use of the "carat" suitable for
Glosa: as in ~Id pluvi ^plu felis e plu kanis^.~?


Saluta,

And, in fact, that's what I do. I believe ~es~ is [almost?]
always a verb, so I omit ~du~ in front of it. When there
are other cases that are "obvious", I will also omit it.
However, when I go back and reread something I've written
two minutes ago, I am much more likely to add markers (both
for verbs and for nouns) than to remove them.

I agree that the two camps should be able to coexist. Let
the writers and readers of Glosa decide whether we need
~du~ (or ~nu~ which might be a better choice) 10% of the
time, or 90%.

Kevin

sometimes with glosa and very often with other languages I get tangled up in 
the implied syntax and need things to be made fairly obvious - age and that 
sort of thing. The "du", I find very helpful with other things but "es" is 
something like 90odd % more likely to be a verb that it doesn't need a "du" 
at all. "being  is not to ......" "u es es proxi ..... " is reasonable 
enough. I agree with you - it depends on your audience - If you are talking 
to me and you do not speak up, be careful with your consonants, keep your 
mouth in my sight and do not use "u" and"du" or whatever, I shall not be able 
to follow what you say - slight hearing loss, memory loss etc age- and I 
shall asume that you are not really bothered whether I understand or not. I 
shall switch off.  I think that knowing where the verb is easily is pretty 
crucial "aqa es humidi" is SVO, ne problem, no "u", "du"
Could we be more tolerant with each other over "I shall assume; you are not

And, in fact, that's what I do. I believe ~es~ is [almost?]
always a verb, so I omit ~du~ in front of it. When there
are other cases that are "obvious", I will also omit it.
However, when I go back and reread something I've written
two minutes ago, I am much more likely to add markers (both
for verbs and for nouns) than to remove them.

I agree that the two camps should be able to coexist. Let
the writers and readers of Glosa decide whether we need
~du~ (or ~nu~ which might be a better choice) 10% of the
time, or 90%.

Glosa has only "concept words" and "particles", or so they said.
Then "ES" must be a particle, and something like "ESSENCE" would
be a concept. Verbs and nouns are old-fashioned Latin grammar.
There's no need for ES in normal circumstances, I think, if
one always marks tense/aspect and never uses passive voice.
That's "copula deletion" and it's common to many creoles.

However, imagine you are in southern India, perhaps, speaking Tamil

You wish to talk to non-Indian people so you look for an international 
language. You rule out English - but in your local library you see two 
books entitled "Acha-Glosa" and "bura-glosa". You pick up the first - 
section 1 - the alphabet -
There are 23 sounds represented by 48 symbols!
24 are used in special circumstances, beginning of sentences, abbreviations, 
proper nouns i.e. names of people, countries, towns etc, days  months.
However each month has two nanes:- Decembre/meno mo bi (meno-mo-bi).
If a month is part of a name it has a capital, the numbers if spelled 
out also(I think) - Meno Mo Bi (sometimes)
there are 3 slightly different cases, "x/X" = k+s, "q/Q" = k+w ("w" is 
not in the Glosa alphabet so "u" can be used instead - the unvoiced 
palatal fricative (sorry!) is spelled "sc/SC"
English" is sometimes spelled "Englisc", sometimes "English" (i.e.  e+n+
g+l+i+s   +   h) try pronouncing that.
"Deutsch" (try pronouncing those letters in Glosa) is pronounced "doic" 
.......
You quietly put the book back on the shelf and reach for "bura-glosa"
We have 24 sounds and 24 signs. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t

International Phonetic Alphabet - try the librarian (I did that yesterday. 
the enquiry 
is being followed up but there certainly was a copy and tape at the

English is listed as "enge-lingua", Deutch as "doic-lingua  doic-landa ..."

*  More exposition needed:-
     . Latin roots were always ragged.
     . Greek went a long way towards systematic short roots.
     . The authors basically followed the Classical languages.
     . What does "mnemonic" mean here?
     . I believe that Glosa does follow on from Interglossa, streamlining
it; and that the authors were, at the same time, following Hogben's
blue-print and redrawing it from scratch, as they progressed with Glosa.
     . Is it that Clark and Ashby demonstrated the selection of
concept/roots by a crude algorithm; or, that irregularities and
inconsistencies in the Clark-Ashby lexicon indicate the need for proper
algorithm development?

*  My feeling is that Psychology, ease of speech, and ease of compound
concept formation are primary, but NOT neutral; then I suspect that the
look (and spelling) of a concept/root - with regard to cultural wrapping -
comes next.  From years of discussion on Conlang, Auxlang and Glosalist, I
have NOT found very much of a neutral nature in "Linguistic Science."  If
anything, I have become convinced that the psychological orientation of the
Linguist strongly colours and biases his research.
   Please give one or two examples of the sorts of 'neutral algorithms' you

*  Well:
     . The few "Q" words in Glosa are very significant ones.
     . I have an irrational faith in the sterling qualities of the human
race - especially of children.  New generations of early primary-school
children will "CREOLIZE" Glosa, doing so while their vocal, auditory and
syntactic skills are still plastic, and not ^straight-jacketed^ to apply
only to their native tongue.
     . The fact that adult Chinese academics have selected idiosyncratic
      pronunciations to go with English letters, and that many Chinese
              
dialects have limited sound-sets, are further challenges for the Chinese
administration .. not for the Glosa R&D team.
     . Not sure about this difficulty for other cultures: are there
statistics on it?
 
>their added flavor is unwelcome. The fewer letters, the better.

*  'Brevity' and 'simplicity' are seen, by some, as two of Glosa's major
weaknesses.  While my psychology - and my basic understanding of education
-  lead me to see the value in these two criteria, I do not want to add
more ammunition to the complexifiers, who oppose Glosa; nor do I see value
in further restricting the mathematically-possible base of brief words.  I
do not see a short alphabet as a virtue in itself; and, to be sure, I can
see a reduction in the range of possible short word .. as the alphabet
shrinks.

a list.
   I guess you mean such things as  -ly, -ed(en), -ing, -s, -'s,
        -ably, -able, -ment, -ism,
        anti-, un-, dis-,
        etc.
   I looked up the Collins Cobuild _English Grammar_ and the associated
_Dictionary_, and found a few of these, but no comprhensive listing of
'affixes.'
   If such a compilation of English-language additions led to something for
Glosa, I would be in it.

*  While I would agree that this is a possibility, I think that human
intelligence and context would disambiguate any such occurences.  The
dropping of a superfluous vowel occurs in such cases as,

  An dona id a fe.     --->     An don id a fe.

  Try saying each one five times quickly, and see which one wins!

Saw the Hemmingway example that starts:-

ombra e no arbores, e la stasion esava entra du linias de ferovia su la
sol. Prosima contra un lado de la stasion, eseva la ombra tepida de la

porta abrida a la beveria, per mantenir la moscas a estra. La american e la
fia ce le acompaniava, sentava se a un table su la ombra, estra la
construida. Eseva multe calda, e la tren rapida da Barselona venira en
cuatrodes minutos.   .....

   I must say Lingua Franca Nova did not grab me as a matter of immediate
recognition.

- are from Greek, or of mixed Greek and Latin parentage: by including both
the existing scientific terminology AND the root-words from which they are
derived, we effect an economy with the Glosa lexicon.

   I would like to find the formula that keeps both groups happy: the

this.

*  I will agree that this is the obvious civilised solution to drawing
learners' attention to the ^trainer-wheels^ version of the language,
however there is the very PRAGMATIC question of cost.  During my time with
Glosa, I have both recommended that learners buy _Glosa 6000_, and, on
occasions, sent names and addresses, plus money, to Wendy .. for some who
might have found the full dictionary too expensive.
   To cover all of Wendy's expenses, I send A$20 each time I ask her to
post out a dictionary; for various reasons, I have not done this often.
   Alternatively, Ron and Wendy used to send the shorter wordlists out, on
two double-sided A4 sheets, in with letterS.
   I will send out many more "Starter Packs" at my own expense, if I make
the first mailing lighter in weight.  Of course, were I to print my own
hardcopy dictionaries using the new laser printer, sending shorter
dictionaries would cost me a fraction of sending _Glosa 6000- via Wendy.

*  With Kevin's Glosa, I sometimes refer to his English translation for
clarification.  However I do not have trouble with it; Sid, on the other
hand, with his experimentation and occasional, unusual constructions does
make me think a bit harder.
   Yet it is significant and serious that Charles and I might differ so
much in the difficulty ratings we register for the same authors.  This is
an obvious weakness of Glosa, both in the range of writing possibilities,
and the subjective responses to written Glosa.
   A level of standardisation is missing.  This could represent a 'fatal
flaw' in the language, if it is not addressed.  Hidden in all this is the
absence of an explicit 'grammar book': should one be prepared; is it
possible to contain Glosa within a prescriptive grammar?  I'd say a short,
two-page 'grammar' would help learners enormously: but, how long would it
take for us to reach agreement on its contents; could we reach compromise,
to formulate a suitable list quickly?

*  Further drastic change will put the language back another twenty years;
I feel that the Hogben/Clark ^skeleton^ is well evolved, and that it is
well ^fleshed out^ already.
   However, a standardisation/clarification of the syntax is necessary, so
that we can all scan each other's sentences with no bother.  Somehow, I
feel that discussion about altering the Clark/Ashby system of syntax, which
I feel is well worked out, would be counter-productive.
   Yes, the lexicon needs to be water-tight, and I had imagined that the
Glosalist group would have completed this before now.
   But the main area that I feel needs further innovation is that of
"Generic Terms."  The printed eighteen make good sense to me; but, as
Charles suggested recently, there is a range of semantic post-fixes in
English .. and many of these should also be available in Glosa.  If people
can say "antidisestablismentarianism" in English, and understand what they
are saying, I feel that this strength, of English word construction, ought
also to be available within Glosa.
   While I am not asking people to pronounce their hyphens, I do strongly
feel that these should be shown in the written form, both for ease of
interpretation by the reader (and the computer), and to avoid any problem
of misleading misreading.
   I have indicated to Charles that I would happily join him in compiling
the list of English-language 'generics.'  Once this list was made, it
should only take a month of Glosalist time to prepare a mutually agreeable,
list of comparable Glosa 'generics.'
   EG   -ability       --->      -abili
        -ism           --->      -ismo

*  Perhaps I should have suggested that a Glosa "Z" was like an English
"S", which is 'sounded.'
  Compare:-   fuss
              fuzz
              pizza

  The first can only imply the 'pure' "S" sound, which is like the hissing
of a snake; for humans, the sound is made at the front of the mouth, with
wind whistling across the teeth. 

  The second implies a noise made at the back of the throat, with something
like a 'rattle' coming up from the voice-box.

  The last, absorbed from Italian, has the same compound "ts" sound that
you report as being the normal pronunciation for the German "Z".

  There might be four sounds /s/, /s'/, /z/ and /z'/, but I think there are
only three:-
     /s/       .... (hissed)   eg  pass
     /s'/ & /z/  .. (voiced)   eg  scissors, lizard
     /z'/      .... (mixed)    eg  pizza

  I believe the Glosa "Z" is the middle sound of these three, the voiced,
or hard, "S".

  Once, or if, we get the written vocabulary under control, we can start on
the pronunciation of Glosa - possibly coming up with a cassette, or CD,
featuring the sounds of Glosa, with spoken extracts read out.  Then the
race will be on: to find the person with the purest Glosa tone.  I
apparently Anglicise my pronunciation; so, it seems as if we are looking
for someone who is 'middle European', which is the way Ron Clark described
the pronunciation of Glosa's consonants.

  P.S.  In my job, as a railway guard, if I want to be rude to a passenger,
who is annoying me by running up the length of the train, instead of

grating one: it is not very nice.     R.

*  I understand that the semi-colon is in disfavour, and is being dropped
out of English, largely because people don't know how to use it, or become
impatient with the requirements of precise writing.
   This could explain the attitude against its appearance, as being "ugly,"
but it does not justify elimination of an invaluable tool in punctuating a
syntax-based language.  Although Marcel did not actually say it, I believe
he is arguing for retention of the semi-colon, as a clause-marker in Glosa.

*  Your English is OK: it's more bad Glosa.
   Using the very clear convention of separating phrases using a comma, as
you do, I will give an English glos (ie word translation) of your Glosa
sentences:-

>U mega kanis voci, casa, teri felis.
>  (The voice of the big dog chases the frightening cat.)
>  [perhaps better: ... u teri felis.]
*  <the large dog's barking - chases - (the) terrible cat>

>U mega kanis, voci, teri felis.
>  (The big dog bellows at the frightening cat.)
>  [Not always easy to find the verb in English as well, I think.] 
*  <the big dog - barks - {at?} terrible cat>

>U mega kanis casa, teri, felis.
>  (The chase of the big dog frightens the cat.)
*  <the big dog's chasing - terrifies - cat>

   Possibly:
   U mega voci kanis, casa, u ge-teri felis.
  [a big barking dog chases a got-terrify cat]
   A big barking dog chases a terrified cat.

Yep!  The comma wins as a phrase-marker.  Of course, without the commas,
well-written Glosa should scan just as well.

I guess I resent, somewhat, the implication that those of
us who enjoy concise languages aresomehow similar to
people (usually young children) who require "training
wheels" on bikes.

In my mind, rather than having the "regular" lexicon and
the smaller "training wheels" lexicon, we would have the
"regular" lexicon and the larger "artistic" lexicon.

Even in English, I prefer to use words that people are
likely to recognize and understand at a glance, rather than
using obscure words just for the sake of variety.

Kevin

Robin says:

Yes, I think it's inevitable. Otherwise it's just another hand-picked
beauty contest, and even by committee that doesn't work well.

Both, because anyone can algorithmize a set of clear guidelines,
but the guidelines must come from the "authors". But I don't think
Latin is appropriate for words like "computer", "rocket", etc.,
though the Vatican disagrees; we need to take new words from
the living languages directly. I've found it easy to mesh the
Romance languages, but many English words fit too:

french   calculateur     computer
italian  calcolatore     computer
italian  COMPUTer        COMPUTer
portug.  COMPUTador      COMPUTer
spanish  COMPUTador      COMPUTer
spanish  ordenador       computer
french   ordinateur      computer

In this case, there is an English cognate matching Romance (probably
because they borrowed it, but no matter) so the root must be COMPUT
plus a vowel (or else COMPU if that's the mandated word-shape).

> I know that Ron and Wendy were aiming at producing a systematic
> auxi-lingua, though they might not always have succeeded:-

I think they made the correct basic changes to Interglossa,
making it analytical and pidgin-like. It hasn't succeeded
because of unfinished/incorrect details. I'd like to see it
taken to the next decimal place of accuracy rather than die.

> brevity

> suitable sounding and appearing root-words

Those go together. Need to define a more consistent word-shape
for the roots. But since Glosa is analytic, there's really
no need to be purely CVCV or bisyllabic (I changed my opinion
on this. CVCV is often too unrecognizable and un-mnemonic.)

> one (or two) Classical roots per concept

> one root - only one meaning

No need to fear synonymns, just allow the users to pick them by
actual usage; a dictionary compiler can BOLD-TYPE the commonest
or ignore the rarest words. There is no way to prevent a word's
meaning from spreading, especially if the vocabulary is minimal.
(Several plausible-but-wrong linguistic theories were embedded
deeply into Esperanto, but we know better now ...)

> a suitable post-fix system to alter word categories

> compounding, using hyphens, to form complex concepts

I used to favor use of final vowels to indicate noun/verb/etc.
But those are tedious in practice (Espo/Idoi/Interglossa).
The main reason was to allow either noun-adj or adj-noun order
so as to please both the English and the French, but Glosa
chose a fixed word order so that's impossible. Still, it seems
attractive to distinguish adverbs from adjectives -- but hyphens
can do that job. So I'd support the authors (A&C) on this point.

> . Latin roots were always ragged.
> . Greek went a long way towards systematic short roots.
> . The authors basically followed the Classical languages.

The modern Romance languages are far better sources than either.
Asking people to learn 2000 brand-new unfamiliar roots can't work;
they need to know that the roots are authentic living Euro-roots,
and think they are learning English/French/Spanish the easy way,
in order for Glosa to compete in any realistic way today.

> . What does "mnemonic" mean here?

It means I can't ever hope to memorize roots like "BARO = press".
Anyone interested in learning an auxlang already has studied some
European language, most likely Spanish or French; they failed to
do it effectively and want an easier language. I succeeded with
Occidental because the roots were mnemonic. Glosa could even
just steal international roots from Occ/Novial ... but I would
prefer to advance the cause by presenting an algorithm to select
by one's own COMPUT from the living international vocabulary.

I agree. Now we all have computers, let's use them effectively.

Both. Same thing.

Because nobody says FAMINA:

portug.  faminto  hungry

That's like looking for a good discussion of evolution at a prayer meeting.

> Please give one or two examples of the sorts of 'neutral algorithms' you

You must first give the design goals, then anyone can write a program,
e.g.: "A root must appear as a common word in at least 3 major languages
in a similar form and conform to a CVCV or CCVCV or CVCCV pattern".
It is up to the authors to specify, then anyone can implement;
at present, the spec is too poor to work with.

> Sounds good, but examples from German, Glosa and French .. with stress

I don't think there can be any difficulty with pronunciation,
adjustment/accommodation is natural and automatic.

> . The few "Q" words in Glosa are very significant ones.

All of the QU words can be spelled CU as in Spanish, or KU if the
Novialesque spelling is retained in Glosa. However it turns out,

Not the affixes, but the words. ABDOMEN goes with ABDOMINAL;
knowing -AL is an adjectival suffix does little good there.
Worse, is FAMILY the same concept as FAMILIAR? I want a full
list of derivatives for each dictionary headword. For now,
I have only "heuristics" (dirty tricks, short cuts, ...)
but even so the results are pretty good.

[and from the following message]

Perl is available for Microsoft and Apple, free of charge,
by download from www.perl.com ... I run the Linux version.
It's the world's easiest programming language, especially for
processing text. My scripts are around 50 to 100 lines long.
Don't we have several programmers on this list?

Well, ID does not have a written initial consonant, but it
is pronounced with a glottal stop equivalent to a consonant.
So I would not expect to elide the vowel from DONA. But maybe
yours is a good argument against having written final vowels;
if DON is the word you can imagine a final schwa vowel.
I think maybe CVCVC is the best word shape for roots.

No, he wanted a pure Romance language without ties to English cognates.
But look at the completeness and thoroughness of his vocabulary,
that's one part that clearly beats Glosa. He shouldn't call it LFN,
because it doesn't much resemble the real Lingua Franca, which was
the nearest cousin to Glosa in form and spirit; for that, see:
http://www.uwm.edu/~corre/franca/go.html

We don't control that jargon, and it doesn't effect daily life.
Dumping those ugly monstrosities into Glosa just pollutes it.
Or must we allow RHINO for nose??

The authors had no business sense. There's no money in book publishing.
Make an online community and charge low admission, maybe $10 per year.
And yes, only the people connected to the internet really matter anymore.

Glosa as it is today, in Wendy's uncompromising mind, isn't viable.
I'd only go along with a reformed version, one that adheres to
solid principles rather than following personal preferences.

So, my recommendations:

1. use word order instead of affixes
2. use recognizable international words
3. use only compounding for derivation

4. publish openly on the web
5. raise money by contributions
6. maintain a cooperative group of authors

7. respect linguistic reseach
8. use Perl
9. don't wait, act now

10. call it Romanglo, Romance Anglo Glosa

As with present Glosa. Good.

I believe this really means recognizable _Romance_ words.

4. publish openly on the web

Sounds good.

6. maintain a cooperative group of authors 
I'm not sure anyone would argue against this but it's tough
to pull off in practice.

7. respect linguistic reseach
I don't know much about linguistic research. I think there
are many valuable things to learn from it, but I also
suspect that many of the findings are more like religions
than facts. I could be wrong.

8. use Perl
Ugh. Most Perl is really hard for me to understand. I
happen to like Ruby, and Python also has merits. But I do
agree that automating processes with scripts is the way to
go. Give me some text word lists and an algorithm, and I
can disregard the Perl itself.

9. don't wait, act now 
Yes.

10. call it Romanglo, Romance Anglo Glosa
I'm not sure I love this particular name, but I do agree
that it should not be called simply "Glosa".

This hypothetical language would not be my ideal IAL,
because it still gives too much advantage to Europeans. But
it does have enough other appealing elements that I would
probably learn and try to use it.

Subject: [glosalist] method for selecting vocabulary
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Wed, 23 Jan 2002 10:37:15 -0800

I've gone further with the automated selection algorithm.
Looking at the official Glosa data we see:

FAMILI ....... family
FAMILIARI .... familiar
FAMI ......... hungry
FAMINA ....... famine hunger hungry starve
FAMO ......... fame famous noted prominent renown well-known

Applying a rough algorithm to the WORDGUMBO.COM English-Romance
word lists (French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese), omitting
the English glosses, I get:

FAMIL   eng family, fre famille, ita famiglia, por família, spa familia
FAMIN   eng famine, fre famine
FAMOS   eng famous, fre fameux, ita famoso, por famoso, spa famoso

There remains the messy question of whether to split FAMILY/FAMILIAR
and FAMINE/HUNGER, but at least the result is plausible. I've found
some "poetic" surprises where a word-concept gets split (or not).
I can see why Ron Clark had difficulty determining where to cut:

FALSA ........ false
FALSI ........ cheat deceive dummy false fraud lie sham treacherous untruth wrong
FALSIRA ...... deceit
FALSAKTI ..... fraud

FALS    eng false, ita falso, por falso, spa falso
FALSET  eng falsetto, spa falsete
FALSIF  eng falsify, fre falsifiez, por falsificar, spa falsificar

Metaphorically speaking, there are no roots, only branches. Whether
to use FALS or FALSI or FALSIF, depends on taste and productive
derivational means. But we also get these:

FALI ......... fail failure
FALTA ........ fault
FALKO ........ falcon hawk
FALKONA ...... hawk

FALAC   eng fallacious, spa falaz
FALIB   eng fallibly, ita fallibile, spa falible
FALT    por falta, spa falta
FALCON  eng falcon, por falcão

My discovery of the day is that RC clearly selected the words of
the Glosa-6000 by simply trolling through dictionaries looking for
cognates, just the same way my algorithm does, which leads to such
striking parallels. The committee that did Ido's vocabulary must
have done similarly ...

FALCH     mow
FALD      fold
FALEN     moth
FAL       fall
FALI      fail
FALKON    falcon <---------
FALS      false
FAM       fame
FAMILIAR  familiar
FAMILI    family
FAMIN     famine

As for word-shape, the nice simple CVCV design works best for up
to 2000 or so roots, but is inadequate in today's rapidly evolving
complex world. I can't find an ancient language that got by with
CVCV, either. My algorithm allows (V)CVCVC, trimming off the final
"gender" vowels to help match cognates; CVC is usually ambiguous,
so is regularly excluded. One can always add a p.o.s. or purely
euphonious vowel after the selection process.

I do believe that a CVCV super-productive neutral language like
Tunu can work. But, Glosa never abandoned use of the international
(Euro-) vocabulary, and the Roget-1000 set is wholly inadequate,
so I think automated a-posteriori is the way it has to go.

(At this stage, I don't K-ify the C-words, but that would
certainly be possible in refining the process.)

     My first reaction to this suggestion is that Ron did define
pronunciation adequately.

Perhaps this is not a generally held belief among Glosalist 
subscribers.


     If IPA (whatever it is) is the logical standard, are there glaring
differences between it and the Clark/Ashby regime, or is it very close to
the authors' "general European," thus requiring only a little tweaking to
bring the two into line?


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

  PS. Were time not the limiting factor, I would look up IPA in a search
engine, and check it out for sound.  But, if it is something know to Sid,
he can contribute to the Glosa serendipity most, by giving the rest of us
a ^shoe-horn^ into it, with URL(s) and possible sound examples.   R.

break up the flow of glosa and make it ugly and jerky. "ke" is smooth and
graceful where clauses need to signalled but joined. the full stop breaks
the flow where we need a break so that our minds can sort out the syntax
and meaning of the previous sentence, a comma, when needed, shows that a
phrase is not part of the main SVO structure. The stop and comma are
logical and useful, I feel strongly; the semi colon is not appropriate.

*   Sid, while I am aware that it is a STRONG feeling on your part, I
have to wonder what are the feelings of the whole world.


     Some people may never have used the European alphabet, others have
never come to grips with written language.  For the latter group, Glosa
might be the very first language they read!  

     So, assumptions made by members of this List, can be very different
from those of large sections of humanity ... for whom Glosa is 
designed.

     I suspect that the right question is: does the usage of comma and
semi-colon actually facilitate the learning and use of a syntax-based
Auxilliary Language for the "naive" speaker/writer?


     And, while I quite like the look of the semi-colon, and consider it
to be a valuable, but under-rated, linguistic tool, </fontfamily>this
attitude of mine is not imposed on Glosa learners; I simply use this
punctuation - as the Glosa authors 'prescribed' it - without bias, either
way.


  Questions might be:-

    . What has research found about the use of commas and semi-colons in
the writing of English-speakers and of other Europeans? 

    . Are semi-colons and commas known to, and used by, people who use
other writing systems, such as Arabic and Chinese? 

    . Is there a current trend towards the simplification of English and
other European languages by the dropping of 'in-sentence' punctuation? 
And, if so, does it seem to represent a real improvement in
communication, or simply a present fashion?

    . Will the teaching of Glosa to new learners - both literate and
non-literate - be facilitated by prescribing the use of commas to
separate phrases, and semi-colons to separate clauses?

    . Alternatively, can the use of commas and semi-colons be made
optional, in Glosa, as it seems to be, at present, in much of English
writing?

    . And, can the comma and semi-colon, per se, be said to have a
clearly defined function within written communication - and
correspondingly, within written Glosa?


  Maybe such question are a distraction, and could lead to years of
unfruitful discussion.  For me the ^default^ position is to use these
punctuation marks, as indicated by the Glosa authors; however, I do
retain the right to apply 'literary style,' even in Glosa, and thus to
use these marks judiciously ... as unobtrusively as good sense 
dictates.


(1)  Tem u ju-gina; qi ergo intra u pani-bo, gene u boni paga, intra u-la

     VS

     ALO


(3)  Tem u ju-gina qi ergo intra u pani-bo gene u boni paga intra u-la
positi mi kredi ke fe pote gene mega ma valuta si fe developo fe plu
hetero abili.


  So, with the above versions of the story:

     does the first hit you in the eye with punctuation;

     is the last just too ^open plan^ for clarity of interpretation, and
does reading it leave you somewhat breathless;

     and while the second is probably understandable to you - with its
unobtrusive punctuation - might it prove difficult to decipher for the
new learner of Glosa?


  My English language version of the same story would have the same
syntax - transliterated, of course - but would have punctuation somewhere
less than Glosa's strictly prescribed (1), and much closer to the more
free-flowing (2).


(4)  While the young woman, who works in the bakery, gets a good pay in
that position, I believe that she can get much more money if she develops
her other abilities. 


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

  P.S. The Glosa version was written first, not the other way around, as
some might assume.  I do believe that this is a clear case of my
'thinking in Glosa' such that it has the structure of a well-formed
English-language sentence, with its clauses nicely in place, and phrases
suitably interspersed.  I feel that, in a language with syntax-based
grammar, the overall structure of each sentence should be perceived
first, before individual words start being juggled into place.  I
acknowlege that this might be a stylistic conceit on my part, and thus,
for others who do not think about their language ability, Glosa's
reliance on syntax  (preferably good syntax) could be one of the
language's major drawbacks.     R.

*  Well, not too sure how you derived these Glosa words, Sid.

   Maybe they were trauled from Plu Glosa Nota.

   However, I'd say that we both 

     - get back to the semantics of the Classical roots, and

     - check that derived constructions are in line with Glosa's 'rules'
of derivation, and also that they are "usable" within Glosa sentences. 


   Before listing a new word or a compound construction, I would suggest
that you try to use the word in a Glosa sentence that has semantic sense.
 If the word or construction just won't go, then it should not be foist
on the learner.


   How do we find Classical semantics ...

    . looking up the word in a Latin dictionary, checking the 'flavour'
of the meaning(s) given; then cross-referencing, by looking up the
English (or other national language) equivalent words we found, going
from English (or other) to Latin.

    . repeating the process in a Greek dictionary, but making the
necessary adjustments between latin and Greek alphabets.


   What is the 'flavour' of a word?

    This is the 'feeling' we get by rolling the word around in our mouths
.. comparing the Classical root with its usages in contemporary words.

   EG. PRE  in "pre-nuptual" -- not what goes on in front of the wedding
bed, but what happens in the time before the couple reach the
afore-mentioned spot.

       ANTE in "ante-room" -- not the time before reaching the room, but
the actual small room that is placed in front of the main room.


  EG2.  ALO  has the vague meaning of "other" or "some other"

an ~alo-pe~ would probably be  =another person.  But with a perfectly
good   hetero = other   why should we cause trouble for ourselves, and
others, by calling in an   alo-pe = other(person)   when this will be
readily confused with   ali-pe = anyone?


What are the rules of Glosa compounding - for complex constructions?

 A. Roots with equivalent functions can be compounded, possibly in either
order.

 B. Compounds with roots representing different semantic functions will
be built in a meaningful order: i.e. with the category word last, and
descriptive words placed in front of it.

    EG  ALTERNO-SANI-MA

       The MA is the actual medicine, paste, appliance or machine.

       The reason for having the 'thing' is to improve "health." 

       Both MA, for MAKINA, and SANI are substantive Glosa words: they
can be used as 'nouns', 'verbs' or modifiers (adjectives or adverbs);
they are symbols for substantial concepts.

       ALTERNO, on the other hand, is a Glosa "Function Word": it does
not stand for anything, but simply modifies, or indicates, relationships
between substantives.

       Thus, we will have neither ~sani-ma-alterno~ nor
~ma-sani-alterno.~

          ~alterno-sani-ma~

            /       |      \ 


relationship    modifier    actual 

 /modifier       /quality    thing


  Thus, as Glosa is 'head final' in its phrase structure, its compound
words have the same rationale: one word in a phrase modifies the next,
and so on, building up the meaning, starting with the least significant,
leading up through more significant ones to the most significant word; in
a hyphenated, compound term, the same rules apply.

  I speak, here of significance in terms of 'linguistic categories' not
significance in terms of ideas in the story being told.

       . Is it just one letter too many?
       . Is it because it's hard to write - with never remembering if the
diagonal line zigs from left to right, or zags from right to left?
       . Or is it because of its variable pronunciation globally?

    We might just have to teach the Germans to be less front-of-the-mouth
explosive with their zeds, and develop a more lay-back, back-of-the-throat
buzz.
    I'm not sure if I'd be happy living in a Glosaberg with no jazz, zebra
crossings or zig-zag white lines on the road.

*    Mi Plu Amika,
     Reckon its time for us to hunt out the world's research into
punctuation.  While good fiction writers can use minimal punctuation, for
scientific accuracy, it does seem a necessary element of good, precise
communication.
     Never realised that the use of punctuation could fire such strong
emotions.  Basically, I do believe that the spoken language has only
intonation and vocal inflection, but no punctuation .. beyond pauses of
different lengths.  So, perhaps punctuation is only a problem of the
written form of the language, and thus not a problem of the language, itself.
     Can't we have variable punctuation, with the sticklers for accuracy
(and pomposity) applying the full Clark/Ashby regime, while the
free-wheelers just let it flow.  Actually, come to think of it, I have not
seen many one-page texts written in Glosa, nor heard many spoken scripts of
five minutes, or more duration.

     Perhaps we need a writing competition, where Glosa-pe with the
different understandings of rules of punctuation, may either translate a
given text into Glosa, or writing half a page on a given topic, each using
his, or her, understanding of the most suitable punctuation within it.
     In the same competition, people could use one, or other, of the Glosa
conventions for tense and aspect ... needless to say giving a full
description of the convention used - at the foot of the page.

     Such test texts could then be read with an eye to the relative ease of
absorption of meaning, and comparisons between the different texts could be
made.
     In such a test text, I might specify use of the archaic, Old Glosa
form, PRA, as my tense particle for Perfect Past Tense.

Saluta,

   http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/


      But there are a lot of other lists, which are longer,  put out by
other Glosa-pe.

      Fairly soon, these lists need to be collapsed into one agreed list.
 I fear that such a task will occupy much more computer memory-space and
involve considerably more time than might have been consumed in
standardising all of the 'official' _Glosa 1000_ lists.


       Who has the best suggestion for the method by which everybody's
"full Glosa" lists can be funneled into a single list?


       Perhaps there are two separate tasks: elimination of unsuitable
words, including unneeded synomyms; and the compilation of one large
list.

       If we put all of the possible words into one alphabetic lexicon,
then each of us could consider this list, and month-by-month, letter-by
letter, we could go through the list to establish [1] the accepted,
authoritative full lexicon, and [2] the words for the 'complete
dictionary, ' to occupy the slot taken up by _Glosa 6000_ at present.

       And if ... the core (1500-word) list was, as Charles suggests,
emboldened from the start, we would be able to establish, and
subsequently extract, this list right from the beginning.

  IE  <bold>A(D)                      at, towards

</bold>        <bold>AB                        away

</bold>        ABDOMINA          abdomen

        ABIES                   fir tree

        <bold>ABILI                    able to be, ability </bold> 

        ABJEKTI              mean (attitude)

         etc


  Which reminds me, how do people feel about the use of all capitals, or
even about using initial capitals, for Glosa entries in future
dictionaries?

  It just happens to be the way that the Glosa authors presented their
work in _Glosa 6000_; will it simplify things for us to follow this
convention, or is there a generally accepted convention for dictionary
entries, that we should follow?

I have a merged list of 8468 entries ... The average Glosa "concept" has
about 1.5 English equivalent words. I like to use this format because
I can rapidly lookup the English (lower case) or Glosa (upper case),
using the command "grep" (case sensitive) or "grep -c" (insensitive):

grep abol gloeng        <--- only get english matches
ABOLI        abolish
METABOLISMO  metabolism
NULI         abolish
STO          abolish

grep ABOL gloeng        <--- only get GLOSA matches
ABOLI        abolish
DIABOLI      devil
DIABOLO      devil
METABOLISMO  metabolism
PARABOLA     allegory
PARABOLA     parable

grep -i ABOL gloeng     <--- either english/GLOSA
ABOLI        abolish
DIABOLI      devil
DIABOLO      devil
METABOLISMO  metabolism
NULI         abolish
PARABOLA     allegory
PARABOLA     parable
STO          abolish

And, just for fun, a quick check through Romanglo, 6450 entries:

grep 'abol' t4
ABOLIR       abolish, abrogate
ABROGAR      abolish, abrogate
ANULAR       abolish, annul
DIABOL       diabolic, diabolical

*  I recall Paul Bartlett mentioning this confusion .. or melding .. of the
tense and aspect elements of verb modification in Glosa.
   While it was not as clear to me as it was to Paul, he also mentioned the
Conditional Aspect, which translated into English as "would".  Adding the
others in this family, "should" and "could," simply because I am a rather
conditional kind of person, I derived:-
    SIO = would (conditional)
    POSI SIO = could
    DEBI SIO = ought to; should

   At that time, Paul and I reached a working truce that ...
     # Exact tense need not be stated throughout a text: once 'pastness',
for example, had been established; as long as there was no possible
confusion, the PA need not, and should not, be included before all
subsequent verbs.
  EG Gangster-speek,
   "Last Fall, Louie and me go down to the place, and we shoot the two
guys; they bleed profusely all over the carpet, and we clean it up, see!"
   Please note: I do not condone crime; however none of my Australian
friends abuse the English language in this way, so I have to fall back on
the popular culture of the American movie.  And it is really only in the
crime movies that such 'bad' English is heard; and, then, rarely from the
law enforcement officers.       bid (but I digress)
     #  The use of Tense and Aspect particles would be only as necessary,
and that if no tense modification was needed, then we could assume the
Simple Present; where no Aspect applied, we did not have to state this
negative.  
     #  Continuous aspect could be be added to the tense particle(s) as
required, making the Tense/Aspect component verb modification an addition
of particles placed before the 'verb.'

  Apart from Paul's concerns, I dropped the perfectly good, Old Glosa,
Perfect Past particle, PRA, because it lost favour with the authors, and
did not fit the two-letter pattern.  IE  PRA = had

  Ron Clark had invented the "Immediate ?Aspect" by coming up with NU.
This particle concentrated the timescale to a range very close to the
immediate present, and seemed to work, too.
  IE  an fago              = he eats
      an nu fago           = he eats now
      an nu du fago        = he is just now eating

      an pa fago           = he ate
      an nu pa fago        = he has just eaten 
      an nu pa du fago     = he has just been eating   

      an fu fago           = he will eat
      an nu fu fago        = he is about to eat  
      an nu fu du fago     = he will presently be eating  (Unlikely)

   EG  U neo regi-pe, de u pusi insula de Splot, nu fu du fago u ceremoni
plaka, te indika an acepti de u korona; qi pa gene mani ex patri ad

      [The new king, of the small island of Splot, will presently be eating
the cermonial cake, to indicate his acceptance of the crown, which has been
handed from father to son for a thousand years.]

sounds reasonable: does it pass the eye, ear and mouth test?  What's it

   Can we think in these Tense/Aspect forms?

   FU HA sounds fairly natural: 
  Mi fu ha tekto u ponti, fu anua, pre tu seqe visita.
 [I will have built a bridge next year, before your following visit.]

   NU comes up as the default VERB PHRASE marker.  In friendly
conversations between consenting adults it can be elided
    EG  Mi nu ki a mi domi.          Mi ki a mi domi.
       [I go home (now).]           [I go home.]

   DU as Incomplete Aspect particle might always be the same thing that I
understand to be the Continuous Aspect: is this so? 
    
Charles, can you give working examples of these particles with English
translations?  I have the feeling that this table might be something of an
over-standardisation; do Tense Particles always have to come in front of
Aspect Particles?  Where would SIO a Conditional Aspect particle fit into
your table?

*  The comments about in-sentence punctuation being "ugly and jerky" could
be a subjective opinion; and, such markings could be the most efficient way
of operating a syntax-based language.
   I too like KE, though it was dropped by the Glosa authors; I do not know
Wendy's current attitude towards it.
   On the question of the opening and closing of clauses, I have always
felt that it was far more important for me to know when I was entering a
clause, than when I was leaving one.  The idea of 'clause markers' seems to
me to mean "Start-of-Clause Markers, not "End-of-Clause" Markers.
   Thus, the semi-colon at the start of an Adjectival Clause, seems like a
fairly painless warning to me, with the clause usually trailing through to
a terminal comma.  Are all Glosa-pe taking notes?  My main education was
from the writing of the children's stories, which can now be found on my
website.  They contain some Old Glosa, and are in need of revision.  I
retire in about one year: maybe then I will bring them up to date.
   However, there is a shortage on Russian, German and other European
children's stories in the Glosa corpus: please choose, as your first
stories, short tales that you know by heart; be prepared to retell the
stories a little to suit your Glosa vocabulary and plot preferences.
   Maybe the first official Glosa publication from my new laser printer
will be the much awaited primer of children's stories told in Glosa.

   Try out your favourite conventions of punctuation and Tense/Aspect.
Nothing will be lost: once a concensus has been reached, existing Glosa
writing will readily be updated, preferably by the original authors.

By "full" do you meen ~5000 words, or ~1500 words?

I have very little interest in the ~5000 word version, but
would like to see a standard ~1500 word list. I think we
could get through the 1500 word list in less than six
months. Slogging through the 5000 word list would certainly
take more than a year.

I would, of course, humbly propose that my own unofficial
Glosa core list be the starting point, because I have
already invested many hours doing exactly the kind of work
that needs to be done. However, I would be perfectly
comfortable if we chose to start from the GID core, G1000,
or Glosa Basic Reference instead. 

Obviously, I had specific goals in mind as I worked on my
list, and if the goals of the group are different, then my
list would not be a good starting point. As a reminder, my
rationale can be found at:
http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa/kevinglosaintro.html

Regardless of which list we use as the point of reference,
I think we should step through that list in equal-sized
chunks (perhaps 25 words per chunk?). Each person would
"vote" to keep each word as is, modify either the spelling
or definition, or remove the word.

We could issue a new chunk every two days, for example, and
allow discussion on multiple chunks to overlap. But the
train would keep rolling along at a steady pace. Of course,
we would have to decide the rules about voting, and
possibly vetos.

After we get through the whole list, we could accept
proposed additions.

At that point, we would have a new Glosa core list, and I
would be happy. Folks who want/need more words could repeat
the process with G6000 or some other source.

I'm hoping we could get through 100 words per week. That
optimistic schedule would have us thruogh 1500 words in
four months.

> Which reminds me, how do people feel about the use of

It's an interesting solution to the problem of how to
search for words in just one of the two languages. I would
be ok with any of those choices, because it would be
trivial to write a script to convert it to whatever format
I desired.

Kevin

The particles sound a distinct possibility. 

I'm toying with the idea that G may need a word to give sound to
punctuation, rather like the old fashioned "stop" in telegrams..... "MUST
GO STOP WIFE JUST RETURNED". In English we signal a stop by falling in
pitch and then starting the next sentence high in some dialects that is.
In other languages there are presumably different signals. 

In glosa comma these signals are not available semicolon they would not

*    Well Sid, 

      The sound in English that indicate sentence structure are the ones
we will teach new Glosa learners, also.

      If Ron and Wendy based the sentence construction of Glosa on that
of English - mainly because  they claimed English allowed more logical
constructions than other languages - then it seem like we are going only
half-way, if we fail to include the vocal inflections and pauses of
English in Glosa.  The good reason such 'musical effects' are found in
English, is that English, of the national languages, is the least
inflected.

      So, English with five inflections is quite close to Glosa with none
(or possibly one).  And, if English requires tone changes and pauses to
make it work, then I guess Glosa needs them even moreso.


       I include the ancient "Tense Table" that was made and filed long
before the _Word_ conventions were in place.  The file, TENSE.TAB, can be
read in _Wordpad_ or any other ASCII reader.  Note: hyphens were used
sometimes and the archaic "pra" is still in the file.

Please restrict beauty-contest ideas to another thread, this
is supposed to be for serious discussion about methodology.
Prerequisites: familiarity with the Interlingua/Interlingue
word-selection algorithms (manual then, digital now) ...
Another amateur's hand-selected list is the last thing we
need for a credible IAL. From what I've seen, Ron Clark's
is better than anything likely to come from such an effort.

Sorry. I didn't realize that the group had already decided
that only mechanical methods were acceptable.

I also didn't realize that this had already been 
agreed upon. I must have missed that memo. 

Someone asked how we could select a vocabulary by working
through the list as a group, and I proposed one option. I
assumed my response was on-topic for the original thread.

*  Good question Alex,
   However there is a fairly simple answer.  In line with Glosa having
"Head Final" phrase structure, the "Head," or main word in the phrase, is
always "Final." ... Or nearly almost always! 
   So the last word in a standard NOUN PHRASE is the substantive word
functioning as a noun ('noun' for short); and, correspondingly, the last
word in a standard VERB PHRASE is the 'verb.'

   This means that the adverb and any other modifiers, like Tense/Aspect
particles, are spoken, or written, before the substantive word functioning
as the 'verb.'  It is easiest to think of the phrases as being of ^rising
pitch^: the low notes, of tense, rumble at the start, and a little colour
is thrown in, with adverbs, as you go ^up the scale^, then at the top of
the scale you reach ^Doh^ in the form of the 'verb.'

   Noun Phrases, in both Glosa and English, also have this rising pitch
format: determinant, numeral, quantifier, qualifiers, noun.  Check it out
sometime.  Try writing some complicated NOUN PHRASES in Glosa, and find
that this is the only pattern that works.

   But, back in adverbs, please note that, in Glosa, modifiers functioning
as adverbs ('adverbs' for short) can start a sentence, and can - as an
elided ADVERBIAL CLAUSE - come after the 'verb.'

   EG  Tosto, an detekti; an valuta pa gene ge-klepto.
       [Soon, he found (that) his money had been stolen.]%

    HOW did he 'find' it  ...  "soon."

    So, "soon" is a functional adverb.
    The English version could be:-
           He soon found that his money had been stolen.*
           He found, soon, that his money had been stolen.$

    While the former (*) is considered wrong it is a very common usage.
The very first (%) has the greatest emotional impact, and this is a case
where psychology beats the acamedicians - with unruly emotion winning the
day. 

     In Glosa, the final version ($), can be explained/allowed by seeing
the rest of the phrase that has been omitted:-

     An pa detekti, tosto akti so, ke an valuta pa gene ge-klepto.
      [He found,    soon doing so, that his money had been stolen.]$$

  Such an 'adverb' following the 'verb' is technically what is left of a
clause, all of which, except for the 'adverb,' has been omitted. 

  In short, we say that in Glosa the adverb(s) come before the verb.

  Your exercise is to write some decriptive passages loaded with
adjectives, placing MOST of these in VERB PHRASES before the 'verbs.' 

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

The other thread was "mine", talking about *algorithm* as the
antithesis of hand-picking and/or voting. Look on the bright
side, I feel too unqualified to comment on your method, and
so won't be polluting your thread with off-topicality. If I
knew several languages including Greek, then I'd participate.

*  Commas and semi-colons are the Clark-Ashby standard; "ke" is no longer
within this standard.  Much as I dislike doing deals, I am inclined to
attempt to do one with Wendy: those on Glosalist would trade their effort
in standardisation of the lexicon for 'relegitemisation' of ~ke.~

(Well, only this reason made me start the effort with the "Similar
Synonyms" and her suggestions.  Otherwise I would have let it be, there
have been preferences already, though not >hers.)
>
*   It is sadly obvious to me the Africa ploy has failed in terms of
spreading Glosa world wide, while the Net initiative has made global
headway.  So, it is fairly obvious that I must try hard to prevent any
divergence and schism occurring between Wendy and those on Glosalist.  I
will persue the question of funding her re-entry into the Internet.

   Somehow, there must be a satisfactory formula.  One of the main sources
for revenue to the GEO (Glosa Education Organisation - a registered
charity), is the sale of hardcopy dictionaries.  So, if Wendy loses this
revenue source, she ^goes out of business^ because she will not be able to
find the cost of postage for letters, printing cost, and conference costs
required to maintain her ^operation.^
   When standardised dictionaries are produced and sold as books, it would
be best if the GEO owns the copyright for these new, "non-errorfull"
wordlists. It does not matter that Wendy might not be in charge of the
printing and distributiopn of such new, improved dictionaries, but it would
be quite significant for her that she recieved good royalties from such sales.

   I might be suggesting that a secretariat be set up, to ensure the
careful recording of sales and the ready transfer of royalty funds to the
GEO.  Perhaps, all Glosa publicity could request that people send a
registration letter to head office, in London, at the same time that they
order dictionaries ... or other learning materials, as yet to be produced.
Perhaps the registration letter would be rewarded by receipt of one
complementary copy of Plu Glosa Nota.  Such a ploy would ensure that the
sales and royalties from dictionaries tallied against registrations, and
Wendy could be assured that The system was working smoothely.
   If, as soon as a standard lexicon can be produced, I was to be entrusted
with the task of converting the compuer files into suitable hard-copy,
then, I would feel silly if I thought that actual paper dictionaries were
posted from Australia, and then reposted from britain to other parts of the
globe.  Wendy could post purchase details to me, and to others capable of
organising the publishing of the new list(s), so that postage distances and
costs could be kept to a minimum.  In such cases, financial adjustments
could be made by Wendy transferring the production and postage costs to the
distributed publishers, keeping the residual as GEO income.

  There is no need for me to make apologies for mentioning the question of
finance, because without it, those, who are NOT on the Net, will not get to
speak Glosa.  Or, they will continue to suffer from the present
inconsistencies in the currently printed publications.

  Somehow, a higher level of co-ordination is required between well-wishers
of Glosa, or differences between Wendy and the List will grow, and an
authorised, improved set of dictionaries will not appear.

   Does anyone feature all the URLs to glosa sites on their website?
   Please let me know, and I will revise my Glosalist "Signature" to
include it.
  
   Considering my technical expertise, the best way for me to spread the
news, is for me to have a file that lists all the Websites - and their
contents - on a floppy disk that I update regularly.  Such a file, as
updated, could be sent out to the Glosalist periodically, preferably
monthly, and prints from it could be mailed out to people who enquire by
pidgeon post.

   While I'm at it, I might suggest that some Glosalist members might like
to co-ordinate one, or more, of the research projects.  If we are to pool
our lists, and actually distil one list from it, then someone, with the
skill and diplomacy of a Research Director, would be required to physically
pull all the threads together, and collate all of the various 'improved
lists.'
   When, years ago, I asked the authors if I could quote myself as Glosa
Representative for Australia, I was told that Glosa Agent for N.S.W. would
be OK.  In my largesse, the best I can offer a Glosa Research Director is
just that - the title.
   Needless to say, the honorary positions could proliferate, with:-
      Glosa Research Director - Dictionaries
      Glosa Research Director - Audiovisual Media
      Glosa Research Director - Sound Recording
      Glosa Research Director - Co-ordination with G.E.O.
      Glosa Research Director - Educational methods
      Glosa Research Director - Web Resources
      Glosa Research Director - Third World
          Etc,

   It sounds good, and could be a lot more organised than the Glosa thrust
is at the moment.

 Quick Translation:  This rarely occurred when our publishing was only by
selling and distribution of books.

 Observations: 
  a. Wendy is not keen on seeing experimentation with the vocabulary.
  b. She has to be concerned with the need for standardisation of the
lexicon, but feels powerless to move on this.
  c. She believes that "people easily adapted to the small changes"
between the Glosa dictionaries and word lists.
  d. There has to be a strategem/algorithm/policy for the addition of
terminology to the lexicon, and Wendy must be a part of this process.
  e. Wendy does not know how to control, or get the best out of, the Net,
and currently lacks the resources to investigate her possibilities.

*  Suspect I have to be at fault, here, for some of the popularity of ~ke~.
 Bundling "which" and "that" as _impersonal pronouns_ we find the Glosa
~qi~ does the job, but it was decided by the authors that to introduce such
clauses, the hard edge of a semi-colon ought to be used at the start of
such a construction: so the proper translation of 
     ... , which ...         \    -->  ... ; qi ...  OR   .. ; ...
      ...  that ...           \                          with elision.

  I remember discussion at the time, that there was a ''softer'' "that",
which was more of a 'logical operator' than an impersonal pronoun, and that
this word was a very handy communication tool, which was worthy of a
'language for science.'  The thouble was that it had not been included at
the start, and I seem to recall Ron Clark deciding to give the Esperanto
_ke_ a whirl, to see how it went.  With existing Glosa ~ki~ and ~ko~, this
new word made "K" a busy letter, but most of us agreed there would be no
trouble.  Then, there was some decision that 
such a foreign construction was not needed, after all.
  There was some rear guard action defending the Esperanto import, but Ron
declared that a neat ";" was all that was needed to do then trick.
  Some of us remembered the facility ~ke~ gave to thought, and wished for
its return.  This definitely looks like a word that is ^voting with its
feet^, and walking back onto the page/screen.  I'd say it would be wise for
Wendy to see the breadth of feeling on this: we can't all be agents for
Esperanto, wishing to insinuate its vocabulary into Glosa.

  As a final word, all I can find in the Latin dictionary is: 
      that  ... , relat. qui, quae, quod; ...

  These enter Glosa:-
             qi   -   impersonal pronoun (introduces Adjectival Clause)
  via Espo.  ke   -   logical indicator (introduces Noun Clause)
             qod  -   impersonal pronoun = what; that which

  Perhaps we can marshal the linguistic case for inclusion of the
concept/function embodied in the symbol KE.  I would like to win Wendy
over, with science.

 EG  His argument against me was that I was a proven liar.
     An   kaso     anti  mi pa es ke  mi es u ge-proba falsi-dice-pe.  
                               ^

                            verb  |-------------A Thing--------------|

*  There is a felt need for emphasis.  Sometimes the plain words are not
strong enough to convince us that we have got our message across: in
logical terms the statement following the ''ghost "that"'' ought to be
accepted as significant, but often it feels as if the case falls a little
flat, and some added emphasis is needed.  The verb and the statement
following it need to be more strongly related - than they are through an
unspoken punctuation.

people down with concerns over grammar.
   By asking people to functionally differentiate between Tense and Aspect,
and possibly any other nuances that fit in front of the 'verb' as
particles, we tend to increase the learning difficulty.  I do favour the
optional addition of particles, such that people can get by using Glosa at
their particular intellectual capacity and educational level.  Some people
would not try to venture beyond the simple tenses, and make up for the rest
with hand movements.

This is easy enough to understand and with its simplicity is perhaps 
preferable to an orthodox and colourless version.
   "Last Fall, Louie and me go down to the place, and we shoot the two
guys; they bleed profusely all over the carpet, and we clean it up, see!"

go, the going, the going price, shoot, shot shooting, bleed, blood, bloody, 
bloodily, .......

In English,it is usually easy to see whether we have a verb because the word 
changes with its function

In Glosa this does not happen so we could have, with a bit of stretching 
etc:-
   "Last Fall, Louie and me movement to the place, and us knife the two
guys; they blood profusely all over the carpet, and us removal it up, sight!"

not all that likely to happen but it is not so easy to extract the meaning.

   "Last Fall, Louie and me did movement down to the place, and we did knife 
the two
guys; they did blood profusely all over the carpet, and we did removal it up, 
see!"

the did makes it easier, odd but reasonabe enough to follow

It's simple and effective English for the masses, a great model for Glosa.

PA PA is probably your PRA. After you "had shot them guys", you would have
reported it in past tense with perfective aspect, in more formal speech.

PA = past tense            You DID shoot him.
NU = present tense         You NOW shoot him.
FU = future tense          You WILL shoot him.
DU = imperfect aspect      You (WERE or ARE or WILL BE) shoot-ING him.
HA = perfect aspect        You (DID or HAVE or WILL HAVE) shoot-ED him.

PA HA = past perfect       You HAD shoot-ED him.
NU HA = present perfect    You HAVE shooted-ED him.
FU HA = future perfect     You WILL'VE shoot-ED him.
PA DU = past imperfect     You WERE shoot-ING him.
NU DU = present imperfect  You ARE shoot-ING him.
FU DU = future imperfect   You WILL BE shoot-ING him.

It cannot be elided because something has to indicate start-of-verb-phrase.
"I gun police down" is sub-gansgster-speak; "I did gun them down" is smoother.

Yes, exactly.

According to Bickerton's widely accepted/reviled pidgin/creole theories,
always the order is TENSE MOOD ASPECT, universally. It holds for English,
at least ... I once made a list of all the useful TMA's and there were
around 30, but only 7 particles are essential. Glosa has too many moods
and seems to lack one aspect; too many is not so bad as too few.

A thought experiment: If all of Glosa's particles were removed, and people
tried to use only the raw concept-words, pretty soon the words would begin
to acquire degrees of verb-ness versus noun-ness so simple sentences could
be less ambiguous -- "You go use gun hit him." In time, the verbiest verbs
like "go/want/finish" become institutionalized as tense/mood/aspect particles.

Nobody in the world likes using a semicolon to introduce a relative clause.
It just highlights the amateurishness of A&C. To violate long-established
linguistic habits and instincts is simply fatal to Glosa's prospects. But
it isn't difficult to solve this problem ... Let's just ask E. G. Robinson:

"The guy, you did shoot him, was a police man?"

> I too like KE, though it was dropped by the Glosa authors; I do not know
> Wendy's current attitude towards it.

We don't actually need KE or QI, we could just set off a relative clause
by punctuation, as Wendy thinks is sufficient. Nothing fancy, but no semi.

"Robin did shoot him, see!" ... or ... "Like, we went to the movie, y'know?"

This has to be the very essence of Glosa syntax and grammar.
Of course the next question is how to recognize the phrases.
And the answer is, by those initiating particles. This is
almost circular, but is OK with me as long as "substantive"
words are immediately distinguishable from "particles", and
they are, by their size (generally; should be universally).

Wasn't the semicolon inherited from Hogben? As were the ugliest
of the Greek words. A&C were afraid to eliminate all traces of
Interglossa, but they should better have done so. I can derive
most of the Glosa-6000 by algorithm, confirming Ron Clark's
vocabulary selection efforts in some degree. But there were
good ideas in IG lost in G, e.g. replacing verbs with verboids.

Change happens. Today there is an emerging Europe faced with a
language problem. Even though most of the useful vocabulary of
English and French and Spanish/Portuguese/Italian is cognate.

You said it. Wendy is not being part of the solution. There

Her place in history is in the past, not the present or future.
It's time for her to pass it on, as Hogben did. IMO.

>> We think that Glosa is an easy language.
>> Na doxo; Glosa es u facili lingua.

>> I think he will come.  = Mi doxo; an fu veni.

"We think this: Glosa is an easy language."
Colon isn't necessary either, a comma would work OK.
Even "this" isn't needed: "I think, he will arrive."
Of course it's ridiculous to ban "KE" ...

I'm untroubled by the supernatural. Grammar is part of real language.

I favor minimalism. Every person on earth makes tense/aspect distinctions
in every sentence they speak or write. You can't *stop* them. About half
prefer aspect to tense, half the reverse. Allow either and everyone's
happy. You might want to reduce the number of moods, though.

> Thinking hard, these categories seem rather abstract and hard for the
> average person to conceptualise.

Try giving examples instead; for most, that's enough. But it isn't
possible to ignore the realities of how all languages work, unless
you want something like Loglan/Lojban, or some naive conlang.
Leave out the particles and syntax collapses in ambiguity.

> By the time I got home, he had gone.
> Tem mi pa gene ad u domi, an pa ha veni.%  (experimental)
> Tem mi pa gene ad u domi, an pra veni.*   (archaic)

I don't mind PRA, but it doesn't cover all the possibilities
mentioned before: 6 combinations of tense + aspect, all of
them extremely common in natural languages such as English.

> The concept of a Continuous dimention to tense, makes more sense to me
> than labeling the action "Imperfect."

Yes; but "perfect/imperfect" was used to imply just 2 grammaticalized
options, whereas "continuous" opens the door to many others, such as
"inceptive/cessative/habitual/etc", which are all useful but ...

> Whether Ron had imagined that, later on, bright people would find a way
> of expressing all of the Aspects and Moods that they would want to express

This can always be done by inserting substantive "adverbs" between
the particles and the true verb. But you need a few particles,
and I suggested the bare minimal set of Bickerton. A complete
verb phrase template would look something like this, where at
least 1 particle and 1 substantive must appear in each v.p.:
(Actually it's missing "negative polarity" and "passive voice".)

	[tense mood aspect] [adverbs verboid verb]
	 ---particles-----   ----substantives----


> I do know that he cut linguistic corners in

I consider his "version 2" a success, far superior to Hogben's v1.
But now it's time for v3, or Glosa will remain in the IAL dustbin.

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sat, 26 Jan 2002 11:21:48 EST

"U Engelingua nu-du es u-mi matri lingua."

"Nu-du" signals the beginning of the verb phrase.
"Es" is very unlikely to be anything but a verb so we could leave "nu-du" 
out, Engelingua is clearly the head of a subject phrase so the signal "u" 
could be left out.
The phrase after "es" must be the object (purists would object here but no 
matter) so "u" could be omitted.

"Engelingua es mi matri lingua" - 

A Glosa phrase builds up to the head word - "matri" modifies "lingua", "mi" 
modifies "matri" so we have "the language of my mother"
do we want "u lingua de mi matri" or "u matri lingua de mi" ?
This head is followed by modifying prep phrases

Neither, unless you're literally trying to say that it is
the language of your mother. Perhaps you really want one of
these:

 Enge-lingua es mi cef lingua
 Enge-lingua es u lingua de mi ju-tem
 Enge-lingua es mi proto lingua
 Enge-lingua es mi basi lingua
 Enge-lingua es u lingua de mi nati natio
 Mi nu cef uti u Enge-lingua

I am willing to accept that ~es~ is *always* a verb, and
thus does not need a verb marker in front of it. There are
(and should be) very few of these exceptions.

Kevin

If there are such things as good glosa and bad glosa, we need a set of

It is wrong to use "ke" but correct to use ";". When?   Should it replace

      Good Glosa is mainly a pragmatic thing .. depending on the innate
language ability of the utterer, such that he, or she, considers the
situation of the reciever, and takes care to make their sentences
reasonably clear and accurate.

      What you ask about, "ke" vs ";" , is simply a matter of convention,
and yes, these conventions can be decided upon, and elevated to the
status of rules.

     Ron hated 'rules', feeling that Glosa should not be a rule-bound
language: that the learner was not to be condemned to learning a whole
book of rules, before he was able to form a sentence.


     OK, we all know that he could have dotted down a page of guidelines
for the production of good Glosa, and most learners would have been
happy.   However, in exactly the same way that English grammar is NOT
taught in most schools within English speaking nations, to-day, a formal
Glosa grammar was not taught by Ron.


    The reason that English grammar is not taught is that it really is
too hard to put into a comprehensive form .. inthe language of
school-children.  Linguistic analysis is usually too abstruse for minors,
and the systems of grammar have changed over time.

     Children in English-speaking culture absorb their graqmmar from
parents, other children, from hearing teachers talk, and from reading
good literature.  They put a functional, pragmatic grammar together, by
construction from their observations; note, of course, that this is
internalised and seldom capable of conscious explanation.


   So, Ron naively attempted to force adult learners of Glosa to absorb
and internalise the syntax of Glosa, by reading the pages of Plu Glosa
Nota.  Well it has not worked for two main reasons: adult learners of
Glosa do not have the playful, plastic minds of young children; and
native speakers of English spend the first decade of their lives in
full-time trial and error to internalise the 'rules' of English sentence
construction.  Adults have mostly lost their child-like creativity, and
crave "rules"; also, they are impatient for success, and want results
yesterday.


  Although you can look for an English grammar book, the rules,
contained, are derived by observation, and not from a ^cook book of
language recipes.^  I have been criticised before for mentioning the
internal language of thought; however, the sparsely inflected, and
largely syntax-based grammar of English is related fairly closely to the
language of thought, which has been found to be predominantly
syntax-based.  Glosa is similar, but , being totally uninflected, it
relies almost completely on syntax for its grammaticality, and this
surface syntax is resonably closely related to the unconscious syntax of
thought processes.  Chinese, like English, is virtually uninflected, and
its usage has, for centuries, been taught through the reading of classics
from Chinese culture.   If this sounds familiar, Glosawise, there is a
good reason.


  Questions about the months, and how to write them, are NOT part of
Ggrammar: they are simply conventions: they do not affect the way we
think about a Glosa sentence we are forming; and they do not affect the
way we say the date.  Saying: D24-M3; Di bi-tet, Meno tri; di-bi-tet
meno-tri, will sound identical.  It's only when we write the date, that
some sort of standard method becomes essential: but this is not grammar!  


   I urge you to make the ultimate sacrifice, and teach yourself to
"think in Glosa".

</fontfamily>  PS  The authors decision on capitals was to use them as in
normal English language sentences, with the rider that proper nouns were
not to be "Glosafied", but were to retain their original (ethnic)
spelling retaining their capital letters, EG

   Although there are no native speakers of Glosa, there is no community of
Glosa-speakers, and there is no Glosaland available for tourists to visit,
I believe that we should have examples of standard Glosa pronunciation,
available to all, on websites, etc.  As long as spoken Glosa sounds as good
as Ron intended it to be, we will distribute computer files, cassette
recordings and CDs of our exemplar speaking the language, and we'll ^suck
them in with sound!^

   Our job: to find one, or two, very short poems that will, when
translated into Glosa, show the language in its best light.
   Then, of course, we need an exemplar.  Such a one could be found very
quickly - through concensus - by each of us making sound recordings of an
agreed text, then finding the Glosa-pe, whose diction is least tainted by
national accent, and whose Glosa pronunciation is closest to what we
imagine Ron intended.
   Before we trial our intonation of the language for a concensus
selection, we will have to have reached a mutually acceptable understanding
of what represents the 'proper pronunciation' of Glosa.  And here I feel
that I must exert some moral suasion (if this is possible on a medium as
dispersed and anarchistic as the Internet) in saying that discussion of the
Glosa alphabet and its pronunciation, if any is needed, should be short and
conclusive.  While others may differ, I believe that, concerning Glosa's
R&D curve, we should, by now, be flattening out in the tail end of the "D"
section of it.

   Here we are after a year, or so's, talk about the need for a
standardised lexicon, and still no-one has taken on the responsibility of
collating the lists produced, so far, to give us a working document.
 
   And now we want to unravel another section of Glosa: the alphabet.  I am
reminded of the old man who tries to fix clocks and has a whole room of
them, in bits, with none working.

  Mathematically, the educated human can possibly produce about a hundred
different spoken sounds.  People who are restricted by their %$#@*&^
cultures have lost the ability to produce a majority of them, but their
children need not lose such valuable inherent linguistic abilities, and can
enjoy a wealth of liguistic expression.

  However, does this mean that Glosa, which is already criticised, by some,
as oversimplified, ought to go with the %$#@*&^ crowd and tongue-tie even
more of the planet's population by adopting a minimalist alphabet?  Of
course not.

>> I would rather drop Q (16 roots), X (40 roots), and W (zero
>> roots) first.
>
* While "W" was always a non-starter in Glosa, the Glosa authors collapsed
the Greek and Latin alphabets down into approximately twenty-four letters.
How many people have said they can't learn English because there were too
many letters?  People have said difficulty came from the wide range of
pronunciations possible for each letter, and from the renge of confusing
usages for each word,
but the English alphabet was never in question - apart from the Initial
Teaching Alphabet (ITA), which expanded it, for learning purposes, to
seventy-five.
  We have no reason, nor any justification, for attempting to cut out
letters from the Glosa vocabolary.

  Words, so debarred, would need to have their concepts re-assigned, or
their spellings drastically altered.
  Who would do this work?
  If the Glosa project was one based on the efforts of tenured academics,
then there would be no shortage of time or trained labour for the task: the
reality, however, is a ^horse of a very different colour^.

  Are we going to lump Wendy with the job?  "Look, Wendy, we've been
thinking on the Internet: we don't like some of the letter, and we suggest
that you change all of the words containing x's, h's, q's, j's, z's, y's
and k's."

  We have already seen her reaction to the addition of one word, "ke".
We'd be out of a patron and founding author; she would obviously take up
something like tapestry, to replace the hole in her life that used to be
occupied by ''Glosa.''

  Come on fellas, isn't this a case of research for research's sake?

  I do believe that there are ares of Glosa R&D that actually are
significant, and which have not, as yet, been touched.  My next, and
probably last, railways holiday - of five weeks - comes in September 2002;
if the lexicon/dictionaries conundrum hasn't been solved before then, I
will have to dedicate this time to a no-nonsense period of intense work in
collating wordlists. 
  Needless to say, I do have alternative plans for that time.. mainly the
elimination of surplus belongings, prior to retirement and shifting to the
country.
  If I find it necessary to clear the lexicon, instead, I will do a very
brief edit to elimiate unwanted spellings, surplus synonyms and archaic
forms, so that I do complete the job in the time, and have some ^change
left^ from my holiday, as well.
  The creative response would be to take this as a challenge, rather than
as a threat.

  The rustic wisdom, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it,' does seem to apply
in the case of the alphabet.

   I see it as historically, culturally, linguistically and mathematically
wrong.  I did not mention "morally", but in the light of all of the honest
work by Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby, I think this goes without saying.

*  These last seven letters found in Glosa are of minority use, but they
are of significance and are historically correct.
   I guess that a Latin dictionary only was used for this count - to get
this particular result for "K".  While there are seven pages of words with
an initial "K" in _Glosa 6000_, and only one featuring the letter "C", the
frequencies are reversed - in contrast with Latin - when we take the
difference between the \hardC/K\ sound, and the \softC/S\ sound into account.

  P.S.  The symbol, "%$#@*&^," represents a politically incorrect concept,
that cannot be expressed for fear of being excommunicated linguistically,
and of upsetting many billions of the world's population.  [Roughly, it

   However, if we keep them both, there really should not be any problem:-
     EG 'Kay sits on the quay.'
      This shows the difference, as long as you get the American, not the

overworked in Glosa and English.  Maybe we can find a distinct mark on the
computer keyboard that will suffice.

Actually these passages do sound different when I read them out.
I hear no /v/ when I read out ~Qe, ... ~.
Nor do I hear any hissing /s/ when I read out ~ ... xeno ... ~.

  For me, "Q" might be /kw/, and "X" is more like /kz/.
  So, considerably more work needs to be done. 

  As you have probably gathered, I am not in favour of tampering with the
alphabet.

so:- intro word, simple adverb(s), head verb, preposition phrase acting

With a sentence's verb phrase, as it is the only VP, the adverbs can be
in varied places:- quickly, in Iceland, It advances - it advances quickly
in Iceland etc. Unfortunately, Glosa, quite rightly, pruned off the "ly"
and decided that "tako" could mean a speed, speeding, speedy, speedily or
to speed. This makes things a little difficult but with a bit of
preposition juggling we could have "ko take" =with speed.

*   Friends, 

     I agee with Sids interpretation of the mechanics of the sentence.

     If clarification is needed, ~Ko tako, ... ~ is better than ~Tako,
...~.

    However, in any sentence that starts with one word followed by a
comma, we can almost always take a guess, that this first word is an
adverb.


    The word should be 'avanti' = to advance.

    So, on the basis of these twe letters, I can't agree with your

have a proper "X" in IPA, like the one in the middle of the word,
"next"?

However, imagine you are in southern India, perhaps, speaking Tamil 

and Hindi etc 

You wish to talk to non-Indian people so you look for an international 

language. You rule out English - but in your local library you see two 

books entitled "Acha-Glosa" and "bura-glosa". You pick up the first - 

section 1 - the alphabet - 

There are 23 sounds represented by 48 symbols! 

24 are used in special circumstances, beginning of sentences,
abbreviations, proper nouns i.e. names of people, countries, towns etc,
days  months. 

However each month has two nanes:- Decembre/meno mo bi (meno-mo-bi). 

If a month is part of a name it has a capital, the numbers if spelled 

out also(I think) - Meno Mo Bi (sometimes) 

there are 3 slightly different cases, "x/X" = k+s, "q/Q" = k+w ("w" is 

not in the Glosa alphabet so "u" can be used instead - the unvoiced 

palatal fricative (sorry!) is spelled "sc/SC" 

English" is sometimes spelled "Englisc", sometimes "English" (i.e.  e+n+ 

g+l+i+s   +   h) try pronouncing that. 

"Deutsch" (try pronouncing those letters in Glosa) is pronounced "doic"
....... 

You quietly put the book back on the shelf and reach for "bura-glosa" 

We have 24 sounds and 24 signs. a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t 

u v x z . We are told that each sound is the same as it is in the
International Phonetic Alphabet - try the librarian (I did that
yesterday. the enquiry 

is being followed up but there certainly was a copy and tape at the 

College of Ripon and St John,York ......) 

English is listed as "enge-lingua", Deutch as "doic-lingua  doic-landa
..." 

take your pick!

Ok Sid: I'll agree that you have put your finger on the impossible.


The Clark/Ashby ruling on Proper nouns is that they are spelt and
pronounced using their home language...

                                  BUT

                                        ...then we can't use the normal
Glosa pronunciation to sound out the name if we don't recognise its
linguistic source, or just don' know who, or where, it is.


   So thats OK.  It's just one of your normal everyday paradoxes: do we
turn it into a crisis, and discuss it fruitlessly for another year, or
so; or do we defuse it by brining pragmatic brain-power to bear?


   It is fairly obvious that if the paradox cannot be defused, then Glosa
is doomed, and we might as well stop now!


   But if the paradox can be defused, then it should be acted upon
immediately, so that a creative resolution can be found quickly.  I see
that Esperanto is still going ... they must have faced this problem too. 
It would seem that they must have defused the proper noun paradox in a
way that was satisfactory to them: I wonder what they did???


   Sid, as well as checking out IPA, please look into Esperanto's
treatment of proper nouns.


   On the philosophical front, I will have to admit that I still have one
foot in the Acha-glosa camp.  It's there because I still believe that
'foreign' words ought to be roughly recognisable to people from the
culture from which they came, as well as being more-or-less discernable
to the general Glosa speaker.  Also, as well as being pronounced as it
would be in its home-land, the foreign word (proper noun) ought to be
pronounced, as well as possible, in its ethnic form by all Glosa-pe.

   So, when a Glosa speaker sees a capital letter suggesting that a
proper noun follows, he ought to be aware that the rules of pronunciation
for normal Glosa words do not apply to the name.

have just sent off for the cassette of IPA sounds, when I get it I'll try to 
make the Glosa sounds from it available. I suggest the use of IPA because it 
is international and saves our disagreeing with each other. Anyone in any 
country thaty starts G would be able to do a standard set of sounds 
immediately provided they can get the IPA publications. I shall follow that 
further, perhaps inquiring of the local University/college as it was

I used it (what a title!)

   BUT it is not the first thing we need.
   Before branching out into dictionary production, we ought to be sure of
the raw materials we are working with: we certainly need a definitive,
comprehensive Glosa lexicon, that has been edited thoroughly, checked for
excessive synonyms, and agreed by all.

   Only after we cansee what we've got, does it make sense tostart chopping
it into smaller dictionaries for special purposes.
   The words in all the dictionaries, long and short, must match, and have
consistent spelling: compiling the comprehensive lexicon is the essential
first step to all this.

   A _Sid's Glosa Dictionary_ (SGD) will give us the compounds and phrasals
that could not have been included in the authors' original
'word-translation' dictionaries.  But the homework before this SGDcan come
about is tidying up the individual words comprising the total lexicon.

*  This is the traditional scholarly approach: classify, then reclassify
again - into even smaller categories.

   For the present, if learners try to lump the *verb modifiers* into a
sort of logical sequence with most of them before the root functioning as
the verb ('verb'), then we have a fairly pragmatic and simple rule.
   Tacking onto this we can state that some modifiers, which are 'adverbs'
do come as single words at the start or close of the sentence, and are
separated  by commas (elided clauses or phrases); then we have it
FUNCTIONALLY DESCRIBED without the need for a lot of Linguistic mumbo jumbo.

   By the way, when a     dog runs QUICKLY
it can, and, according to the basic 'Head Final' rules for Glosa phrases,
ought to, be rendered into Glosa as a    kani tako kursi.

EG  U kani taco kursi longo u via.
    Frankly I use the synonym, ~celero~, but this is only a matter of
personal choice, and what my brain tells me runs off the tongue best.

While I applaud this initiative, I believe it is premature.
We should have a solid language before we increase our
attempts to spread it widely.

Any recorded Glosa today would probably use words that will
not end up being in the official core word list, and so
would be poor learning tools.

Of course, that assumes that there eventually will be a new
official core word list. More on that in another email...

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 27 Jan 2002 17:59:08 -0800 (PST)

[Mi fu imedia kopi u-ci nota per Glosa, plus.]

So, we seem to have three proposals on the table for how to
move Glosa's lexicon forward. If we can't get going on (at
least) one of them, I have a hard time imagining how Glosa
is every going to advance.

Here are the proposals as I understand them. Hopefully I
will treat each one fairly. If not, I'm sure the supporters
of each will chime in with corrections or clarifications.

1. Rules-based
Come up with rules for converting Romance roots into Glosa
(or Romanglo) roots. Use computer tools to automatically
generate word lists.

2. Ad-hoc lexicon refinement (comprehensive)
Step through all known Glosa words, and simultaneously
refine both the "large" word list (e.g. G6000), and the
"core" word list (e.g. G1000). Since words from all
sources, including PGN and this list might be included, it
is not yet clear what method(s) would be used to select
specific words.

3. Ad-hoc lexicon refinement (core)
Similar to #2, but the only goal would be to come up with
perhaps 1500-2000 core roots. Expanding the lexicon
(perhaps to 5000 roots) would only occur as a second phase,
after the core list had been established.

---
Ok. That's the (hopefully) objective part. Now for my
opinions.

#1 sounds like a pretty good way to design a new language.
If the goal is to create Romanglo, then I think this is the
way to go. On the downside, it would make obsolete large
amounts of existing Glosa writing, and require those of us
who already know Glosa to, in effect, learn a new language.

#2, I am afraid, is unlikely to happen in my lifetime. (I'm
in my 30's, by the way). This is a HUGE task. It could
possibly be done reasonbly quickly by one person, but the
only person with the authority to do it alone would be
Wendy, and I doubt she's up for it. Any type of committee
would, I believe, simply take too long.

#3 is my favorite option. As a group, we should be able to
agree on rough criteria within a few weeks, and begin
working through G1000 (or a similar list). As I mentioned
before, I think we could get through it in less than six
months, and we would have a new core language.

There are some significant questions that would have to be
worked out before #3 would be feasible. First, we would
have to decide what role Wendy would play (which might
partly depend on her internet access). Second, we would
have to agree on the rough criteria for word selection.

As Charles pointed out, either of the ad-hoc approaches
will appear "amateurish" to some. They would not be able to
take maximum advantage of existing Romance words, nor of
the most modern linguistic thoughts. However, they would
excel at creating a language that works "emotionally", and
at maximizing existing Glosa materials and knowlege.

I guess I'll throw in a fourth option, which is really a
variation of #3:

4. Ad-hoc migration from Glosa to Neoglosa
Basiclly, this would be exactly like #3, but with one
exception. The result would not have to be blessed by
Wendy, because it would no longer be Glosa. It would be a
derivative langauge which would inherit as much as possible
from Glosa, but the group that creates it would have the
flexibility to deviate where they felt it would be in the
best interests of the language. One perfect example might
be "ke".

Now that I write this out, I believe it is really my
favorite choice. I want to leverage as much as possible
from Glosa (which is why I dislike option #1), but I don't
think it is possible to make rapid progress and also keep
Wendy happy. This seems to be the best compromise.

There are about five of you out there who are active on
this list. Please speak up on this issue, as I believe it
is the most important challenge facing Glosa today. If we
cannot move forward in _some_ direction, we are doomed to
keep spinning in place.

Thanks for listening,

Kevin

Sorry, my information seems to be wrong.  This program is no longer 
free software, although I am sure that it once was declared as free 
on the source where I got it ( http://www.zdnet.org ), really.

Perhaps the Fraunhofer-people ( http://www.iis.fhg.de/amm/download/ )
wanted to establish their format, which they invented, with free
software.  After it is standard now, they hope to earn money with it. 

Nevertheless there seem to be free/shareware Layer-3/MP3 encoding
programs on the net.  If you have problems to find one, please do not 
hesitate to contact me directly.

[It is more comfortable for me to write in German than in English.
Please do not feel annoyed.  After each paragraph I will translate
into Glosa ... ]

Hier war deine "teknologi"-Wörterliste wertvoll.  Sie machte Wendy
bewusst, dass im Glosa-Wortschatz eine Menge Spezialwörter fehlen -
auch wenn ein Kernwortschatz (Core/Central/1000) für 90 % aller
Texte ausreicht.
  / Ci tu "teknologi"-verba-lista pa habe valu.  Id pa sti konski a
  / Wendy; poli speciali verba minus in Glosa-verba-lista, -- anti-co,
  / si u nuki-verba-lista (Core/Central/1000) sati pro 90 % de
  / pan textu.

Jede Aufgabe kann man als "HUGE task" formulieren, oder sie in
Schritte zerlegen, die einzeln durchaus zu bewältigen sind:
Man könnte zum Beispiel den Glosa Internet Dictionary um Ron Clarks
"teknologi"-Liste ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/pgn86p6.htm ) erweitern.
Ein durchaus überschaubarer Schritt.
  / Pan buta pote gene nima "HUGE task" (tro mega buta).  Alo -- na

  / "teknologi"-lista ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/pgn86p6.htm ) a
  / na Glosa Internet Dictionary.  U-ci feno facili.

Man könnte Schritt für Schritt die Vokabeln aus "18 Steps to Fluency"
in den Internet Dictionary ergänzen.  Viele dieser Wörter sind nicht
so überzeugend.  Es gibt dort aber Wörter zu Spezialthemen
(Fahrzeugtechnik, Bienenzucht) und einige sehr schöne Komposita mit
den Generic Terms (-lo, -zo, -ve ...).
  / Na gradu-per-gradu pote adi plu verba ex "18 Gradu"
  / ( http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm ) a na inter-reti diktionaria.
  / Poli verba ex u-ci bibli ne es fo boni.  Anti-co id habe plura
  / uti verba pro plu speciali tema (per exempla vagona-teknologi =
  / automotive engineering, kulti plu api = apiculture) e plura kali
  / ge-kompositi verba ko plu "Generic Terms" (-lo, -zo, -ve ...).

Oder man tippt einen Artikel aus "Plu Glosa Nota" ab und durchsucht
ihn dann mit einem Computerprogramm nach neuen Wörtern, die dann
ergänzt werden.  So kann man Schritt für Schritt den Dictionary
erweitern.  Und ich denke, wir sollten und müssten es tun.
  / Alo na tipo artikla ex "Plu Glosa Nota" in puta-me e cerka
  / la plu neo verba per puta-me programa.  Po-co na pote adi plu-ci

Interessant: Kevin spricht von "only a second phase", während Robin

Ich glaube, dass hier ein Kommittee, wie du es vorschlägst, nicht so
effektiv ist.  Viel besser ist das, was bereits im Gange ist:

Ich war teilweise unzufrieden mit der Liste von Bill, also habe ich
daraus eine neue Liste gemacht.  Du (Kevin) warst unzufrieden mit
meiner Liste, also hast du deine Liste daraus gemacht.  Ich ergänze
gerade meine Liste um die Verbesserungsvorschläge, die ich von Wendy
erhalten habe.  Danach werde ich Dinge aus deiner Liste ergänzen:
von dir ergänzte englische Bedeutungen, deine Parenthesen, die die
Wortbedeutung klarer machen und ich weiß, dass ich die Anzahl der
Wörter reduzieren muss.  Dann müsste meine Liste wieder besser sein
als deine.
  / Mi ne pa este sati kon plura mero de verba-lista de Bill, seqe-co

  / tu parentesi; qi face u semani ma klari, -- e mi ski; mi nece
  / reduce u nume de plu verba.  Po-co mi lista sio es ma-boni de tu

Danach wird es vielleicht wieder jemanden geben, der unzufrieden ist
und eine neue Liste erstellt.
  / Po-co uno-pe fu veni; qi ne fu este sati itera e pe fu face u neo

Also: Konkurrenz statt Kollektiv.
  / So, in brevi: kompeti vice kolektivi (grega-ergo).



 > ... First, we would have to decide what role Wendy would play ...

Ich hoffe, dass wir eines Tages eine Wörterliste haben, die so gut
und überzeugend ist, dass wir sie drucken können und Wendy sie dann
statt ihrer alten Listen als GEO-Liste verkauft.
  / Mi spe; uno-kron na fu habe u verba-lista; qi es tali boni e

Bloß das nicht!  Das wäre höchstens der letzte Ausweg, wenn wir uns
mit Wendy bis aufs Blut zerstritten hätten.  Davon kann zur Zeit keine
Rede sein.  Wer ihre Vorschläge zu den "Similar Synonyms" sieht
( http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm ), muss von ihrer Kooperativität
beeindruckt sein.

 > One perfect example might be "ke".

Über "ke" herrscht auch in Glosalist keine Einigkeit.  Es war nur mein
Lösungsvorschlag für diesen Streit, "ke" im Dictionary anzubieten für
die, die es benutzen wollen.
  / De "ke" na ne habe akorda in Glosalista.  Mi solo pa volu solve

Ich bin auch nicht mit dem Wortschatz zufrieden, sonst würde ich auch
nicht so viel Zeit darein investieren.  Aber bitte lass uns nicht
vergessen: Glosa funktioniert!  Mit dem Material, was wir heute im
Internet haben, kann man Glosa benutzen.
  / Mi pluso ne este sati ko plu verba.  Hetero kaso, mi ne sio ergo
  / ko verba-lista tali mega tem.  Sed, place memo:  Glosa funktio!
  / Ko materi; qi es nu-di in inter-reti, pe pote uti u lingua Glosa.

Bitte guck einmal die Bahai-Texte an
( http://www.glosa.org/en/bahai.htm ).  Wir würden vielleicht sagen,
dass viele Wörter darin nicht welche sind, die wir heute als
Core/Central/1000-Wörter auswählen würden.  Einige sind einfach alt,
ja, auch "ke" ist drin!  Auch sind Wörter ergänzt, weil es sehr
spezielle Texte sind (Themenbereich Religion).  Dennoch: es
funktioniert.  Alle Nachteile macht Evelyn Jerrard mit einem klaren
Glosa-Stil wieder wett.
  / Place vide plu Bahai-textu ( http://www.glosa.org/en/bahai.htm ).
  / Posi na sio dice; poli verba in plu-ci textu ne sio debi gene

  / (tema religio).  Anti-co: id funktio.  Pan 'kako' verba gene

  / Jerrard.



 > Thanks for listening, Kevin

Gratia pluso.  Saluta ex Marcel.

use IPA and one problem is solved "x" becomes "ch" in "loch" etc easier to 
pronounce that "ks", add "u" to "q" as in english "qu" and another problem 
solved also, "q" in IPA is quite like "k" in sound in G.

This is part of the more used end of my used-in-PGN/glosalist collection of 3 
Jan 02,
I suggest that those people working on dictionaries could  make use of these 
frequencies to decide what words to include as they reflect what the users 
themselves think.
The full list extends down to quite a long list of oddities of only one 
occurence - the rarer words would not be included. As the list becomes much 
longer and more representive some words would creep onto a list and others 
fall by the wayside. The choice would be directly influenced by only those 
who actually write Glosa.

"The authors decision on capitals was to use them as in
normal English language sentences"


I looked in the index of the "Oxford English Grammar"/Sidney Greenbaum for 
guidance but wasn't guided as well as I would wish - more Sydney Pidd's 
shortcomings than Sidney Greenbaum's. Advice could be something like the 
following:-
first letter in a sentence a capital - that seems to be a safe bet.
proper nouns (what is a noun in G? what is "proper"?) Professor Lancelot 
Hogben - head noun and its modifiers - a proper noun is of something unique 
(john smith or John Smith?) - days, months, Decembre - Meno mo bi, Meno Mo 
Bi, meno Mo Bi ...........  French/Spanish Glosa-pe might disagree. - 
abbreviations that make words or groups PGN except in the case of "radar". 
So, G has to inherit the muddle of English ( an IAL?) also to speak or write 
good G you need to learn English first!
If G is to insist on unnecessary capitals, it must make a reasonably 
comprehensive and logical set of recomendations of its own or let G users do 
as they wish. I must confess that capitals have their attractions carved by 
romans (Romans?) in stone for instance and how splendid and dignified they 
look as roman numerals CXICICLIMVII (!)

Good point. I started to write up a simple proposal, but my
one rule became two...then three...then became muddled.

Given the difficulties I have coming up with a simple
definition of proper name (or proper noun), I guess I could
live with just one rule:

Capitalize the first letter of the first word of each
sentence.

But then, what does that really add? We do already have the
end of sentence indicators (.?!), so the point of capitals
is what? I'm surprised to have ended up in this position,
because I found the capital-less writing difficult to read.

Perhaps that's the answer. But it seems cultural-specific.

If Glosa is ever ''given to the world,'' 50% of learners will be adults
attempting to cram it in - without much digestion - and 50% will be
schoolchildren, grateful for all the shoe-horning they can get.
    The less than 1%, comprising Professors of Linguistics, language
enthusiast, and a small literati, will want the pure language all in one
hit.  However...
    I was thinking that people for whom the European alphabet is a strange
foreign invention, much like Chinese writing is to us, will be grateful of
a limited, simple and 'easy to recognise' vocabulary.  I know that many
English-speakers, who are linguistically illiterate, will be very thankful
of being able to pick up Glosa in morcel-sized chunks.

  Ron Clark did try that, if you take the 'Glosa 6000' dictionary as the
"regular" lexicon.
  For me a 'trainer-wheels' vocab is the mythical Learner's Dictionary of
approx. 2500 words.  The Glosa 1000 list is a 'bastard' list made up to fit
inside an air-mail letter.

   And this gets to my 'PRAGMATIC question of cost,' which point you failed
to comment on: somebody, or something, has to cover the  P&P costs of
distributing the raw materials of a language.
   The bigger your teaching lexicon the bigger are your printing and
postage costs.  I know that Paul Bartlett dislikes my mentioning this very
pragmatic, and unscholarly criterion for vocabulary size, but it has been a
significant factor in the size of functional vocabulary of Glosa-pe.  I
understand that Sid Pidd's restrictionof his Glosa use to the '1000' list
is that he expects that all functional Glosa-ists will know what he is
speaking about.

   How many Glosalist subscribers have equipped themselves with "Glosa
6000"?  This is not a matter of criticism of those who have not: it is a
comment on the rather high costs of purchasing one, and having it sent to
you.  At the beginning of a project like this one, pragmatics do play a
significant part.
   As very soon as an agreed lexicon can be compiled - with, or without,
Wendy's approval; but, preferably WITH the authorisation of Glosa Central,
I will find a way of laser printing it, doublesided, using the least number
of pages.  If I am to act as a seminal point for the Glosa lexicon .. from
the continent most distant from anywhere else .. P&P will be a serious
consideration for me, because I am liable to give away numbers of copies of
both a Learner's 2500 Word Dictionary and the full lexicon.  So, having
observer the non-commercial nature of anything other than the well-known
Esperanto, I figure that to restart the Glosa process, I will have to give
away scads of wordlists, which are likely to be printed on air-mail paper.
The cost of laser printing and sea-mail will be significant to me, despite
what Paul Bartlett says.

   All that is stopping me is the compilation of the full lexicon and the
selection from it of a shorter starter vocab, and a longer literary vocab,
of approx. 2500 and 6000 words.
   For financial reasons I cannot retire yet, but in a year's time, when I
am 'not in paid employment,' I will tackle the task - if resolution has not
been achieved before then.

>Even in English, I prefer to use words that people are
>likely to recognize and understand at a glance, rather than
>using obscure words just for the sake of variety.
>
*  This does not compute!
   Some of the Greek and Latin roots, in the full lexicon and the Literary
Dictionary, will seem "obscuire" and some will frefer them, just to
'impress' others.  However, I think that the words for a Learner's
Dictionary will be decided, by concensus, on Glosalist, to be those most
likely to be "recognised" by speakers of English and the European languages.
   The word "variety" rates as an antonym of "repetition"; and, the reason
that some writers, choosing to exercise good literary style, will use Greek
and Latin synonyms within Glosa, is that they feel uncomfortable with
repetitious writing.  I'd be prepared to bet that such an element of good
style is found in all cultures that have a written language.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

  Yes I think the exercise was worthwhile: it helps set standards for

  As a P.S., the lexical items, and their spelling, I used are all found in
Glosa 6000.

*  O.K. that's it: I'm going to have to gather up all of the word-lists in
existence, and compile them into a 'Draft Total Lexicon' comprising all
words and all variants of spelling.
   Reckon I'll have to split the work into twenty three segments - one per
letter of Glosa's alphabet.  Be ready to help with the concensus on
spelling when the "A"s hit your screen.  My guess is that all obscure words
can be left in the Total Lexicon; but we will still need to iron out the
wrinkles of words with different spellings.

   How I fit all this in .. between saving the World, and getting ready for
retirement .. I do not know, but it's got to be done.  
   Oh, Yes, though it is off topic, I would mention another distraction: I
have registered with Sony to play the game, "Everquest."  However, I can
only do so at present on my daughter's system, and this only when she is
not connected; it's a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing game
(MMORP), and a very addictive one.  Presently, my Barbarian Shaman,
'Kirsk,' is at Level 4, hunting in the snows outside Hallas on the mythical
island of Antonica within the world of Norrath.
   Considering that I can be another five characters as well, I am looking
forward to getting my purpose-built, superior game-playing computer, so
that I can get on with the quests.  After I have the Everquest machine made
up, there will be even more tension in my time budget than there is at
present.  So, I might cut back my Glosalist involvement proportionally; it
could get to the stage where, in my virtual/reality world, the most
intriguing 'quest' gets first priority.

   Meanwhile, back at Glosa, once we agree to the Total Lexicon, which
results from editing of the Draft Total Lexicon's spelling, we can get on
with "emboldening" the most commonly used thousand words, compiling a
Starter Dictionary file (of approx. 2500 words), and preparing a Literary
Dictionary (equivalent to the present Glosa 6000).
   At what stage is Wendy Ashby brought into the process?  Agreed she
should be in it now, but since she is not connected, this involves the
sending of pidgeon-post letters halfway around the world and back - without
the benefits of the virtual immediacy of reply from the Net.

   And there's another question: who among us thinks about the
dissemination of Glosa ideas plus printed Glosa wordlists and dictionaries
to those outside the Internet?  How many others on Glosalist consider there
is relevance in our compiling least-cost-postage, printed dictionaries, for
distribution beyond the Net?

*   These all use the  com-put-er  conceptualisation:

        ~=  altogether - thinkORcalculate - er(person/thing/doer)

    In 500 years will ~puta-me~  =  thinking - machine   not be a briefer
and better derived term?

    This is an ideological conundrum: should recognisability over-ride
the rules of derivation (which are concept/logic based); or ought the
suitable Glosa term represent the fundamental ideas comprised by a
concept?

    Still, if I say, "Yesterday, he finally computed it," how does this
look in Glosa?

     Pa-di, an pa fini compu id.    Pa-di, an pa fini computi id.   

  But whatever happened to the "C"/"K" discrimination?

  

     Pa-di, an pa fini kompu id.    Pa-di, an pa fini komputi id.   ???


  Then there is the question of derivative terms:-

 computer printer   -   puta-me tipo-me,  kompu-tipo-me, 
komputi-tipo-me

 while computing   -   tem uti u puta-me,  tem kompu,  tem komputi

 a computer printer ribbon  -  u puta-me tipo-me riboni [RIBONI??
banda?]

                               u kompu-tipo-me riboni

 a laser printer cartridge  -  u laser tipo-me inklude-ra  

 a computer-typed book  -  u puta-me ge-tipo bibli, 

                           u kompu ge-tipo bibli

                           u komputi ge-tipo bibli


 a book on computer type-faces  - u bibli de plu tipo-stilo pro 
puta-me,

                                  u kompu, tipo-stilo bibli

                                  u komputi-tipo-stilo bibli

                                  u puta-me-tipo-stilo bibli

   Firstly, I give possible roots the 'tongue test' by finding how the
phrase feels and sounds, when I say it.  Does the prospective root _feel_
right when I try it in its various functional roles!?

   In the case of <<computing> it could be more comfortable to have two
roots here: <bold>puta-me</bold> and komputi.  While these would
represent Glosa-generated synonyms - one Classically based, and the other
derived from National language usage - it would keep the fusty old
fundamentalists, like me, happy, while allowing Charles and others to use
recognisable vocab.


   While on compounding, is ~-tipo-stilo~  'printing style' or
'type-styles'?  Once the computer appendix to Glosa is decided upon ..
and published .. then a set of derived terms, with their implied
derivation algorithms plain to see, will be ^set in concrete^ and will
allow people to see the compounds as "prescribed", and not as an ad hok
set of inspirationally derived terms.  

   The user of a language wants to look up a word, memorise it, and use
it the same way every time.

   However, he wants to feel confident, also, when he meets a newly-added
compound including a root he knows, that - according to the derivational
rules (algorithm), which he has picked up subconsciously - he interprets
this new usage correctly.

   Thus, I believe that the derivational algorithms work at two levels:
firstly, within the research community that derives them, and applies
them to lexicon formation; and secondly, intuitively, subconsciously by
the learners of the language.

   While such algorithms should be unobtrusive, leaving the user with the
feeling that they are speaking a recognisable, pleasant-sounding, and
well-formed language, they also must satisfy the criteria of those
actively using them to produce new lexical items.  Do the newly-formed
compounds look and sound pleasant?  Are they awkward to fit the mind and
tongue around?

   If we are to put every root and all of its possible compounds ^under
the microscope^, then Glosa will wait another decade, or so, before
Fairy-Tale writers will think of putting pen to paper in the cause of
translating/telling/rewriting, into Glosa, the stories of their
childhood.

   

   It is my observation that the logic of algorithm-formation is not
always the way the mind works: otherwise the search for 'language
universals' would not be an on-going persuit.  While a PERL algorithm can
be given to those transcribing Special Interest Appendices into Glosa, I
believe that a set of instructions is needed, also.  Otherwise, such
programmed transcribers are likely to come up with sectional Glosa
lexicons that contains significant amounts of words that seem un-natural,
and do not fit well within the human mind, mouth or ear.

    Personally, I am happy to say that modifiers come before the
substantives ('adjectives' and 'adverbs' come before the 'nouns' and
'verbs'), and leave it for the writer/speaker to sort it out.

    I know that, in English, we appear to use adverbs to modify
adjectives, but saying it this way could simply be a Linguists'
confusion.

*   This may be the truth, and Ron's idea of a language for science,
might have been only a dream.  I am torn between having a 'tourist-based'
language that all can learn easily, and of concentrating on a
'technology-based' language that is purpose-built for wide-ranging
participation in solution of the Planet's very evident environmental and
organisational problems.

science-based language; I still do not know if this is a possibility, but

  BUT the Latin dictionary gives  <italic>fames, famis.

</italic>  So, is the "N" also a post-Classical addition, as well?

  I think of "to be hungry" as ~habe famina~.

  Is it   U andra pa habe famina.  OR  U andra pa habe famin.  ?

  EG   An famina pa habe ta forti, ke an fago u holo kani.

       An famin pa habe ta ...


  The word Ron used, was "sing-song," to describe the value of the
terminal vowels.  I suspect that this thought applies here: I might think
that FAMINA beats FAMIN.

    Sadly, I do not feel the need for a retrospective specification of
Glosa's vocabulary, simply a prospective one for neologisms.  And then, I
would imagine a 'reviewing committee' looking at the items of a Special
Interest Appendix, and making suggestions of alternative words, where the
proposed terminology seemed at variance from the theme of the language.

    The only positive factor, on the economic side, is the establishment

*   Well, I cannot see there being anything other than choices being
made: alphabet, pronunciation, style of grammar .. and then you seek out
a suitable vocabulary base.  Indo-European comes to mind.

    At least the Euro script is ubiquitous on computer keyboards, it has
a reasonably general usage across much of the world; and, through
historical fact, the Euros control most of the World's wealth.

    And now, with America declaring its status as the World's remaining
super-power, do we have any choice than to acquire a Euro-based
lingua-munda?

The capital letter in the beginning is enough: Sterling.

I feel "ton" as an international word, not special English, though
perhaps even here a capital letter would be better and enough then:
Ton.

Again and again Robin emphasizes, how much he likes "Glosa 6000" and
that he will make it to the starting point of his new dictionary.
Repeatedly I say, that I do not agree.  I wrote my opinion about
"Glosa 6000" in http://www.glosa.org/en/bibli.htm .

Some of these are actually the ones who might want a bigger
language in my mind.

Anyway, I think you just agreed with me that a language
with fewer words would meet the desires of nearly 100% of
the target population. (Actually, I would put the number at
more like 60-80%).

For the last several months, I have restricted my Glosa
vocabulary to the words in my unofficial core list (ever
since I created that list). I only rarely have trouble
coming up with the right word to express my thoughts. Even
then, with enough creative thought, I have not yet had to
exceed my 1200 root inventory.

>    How many Glosalist subscribers have equipped

I have one, in electronic form. I need it to read Glosa
that other people have written. I find it cumbersome when
writing my own Glosa material, because there are too many
synonyms to choose from. And I prefer to write in a way
that people can read without having to refer to a word
list.

> shorter starter vocab, and a longer literary vocab,

I can live with those names for the lists. "Starter" is
nicer than "Training wheels", and the fact that neither is
claimed to be the "regular" list helps.

I think this partly depends on _why_ you are writing. If I
am writing specifically to communicate an idea to someone,
I would prefer to do so in the most direct way possible.
Repetition is fine in that setting. In fact, it is a _good
thing_, because at worst the reader only has to look up one
word, instead of three words that hold the same meaning.

If you are writing poetry or literary fiction, or perhaps
if you are giving a speech, I can understand why repetition
might hurt the "flavor" of what you are trying to say. 

But what is the primary purpose of an IAL? In my mind, it
is to efficiently deliver ideas. Eventually, later, when it
is already serving that purpose and people wish to expand
it to other uses, and enough people are already comfortable
with the core words, then the extra words will be helpful
to some people.

I still think that's the long way around. I (and everyone
else) will have a much harder time participating, because I
will have to look up and understand something like 10,000
words, just to make informed decisions about words that I
know I will never end up using in practice.

Why would it be so bad to start with 2500 words, and then
grow the list as a second step?

I think that those of us with access to instant
communications should bear the brunt of smoothing out the
language. Once the language becomes reasonably stable,
printed material makes a lot of sense.

I am all in favor of fewer words, so as a side effect I am
in favor of lower printing and mailing costs.

I'll propose one possible set of rules:

Capitals are used to start a sentence.

Also, use capitals whenever there is a name that is not
necessarily a valid Glosa word. This indicates that there's
no point in looking the word up, because you [probably]
won't find it. The word might actually happen to _be_ a
Glosa word, but the meaning is not relevant to
understanding the sentence.

Thus, I would say:

Mi feli nomina es Figaro.
Mi kani nomina es Mega.
Mi mega kani pa kursi.
Mi e Mega pa kursi.
Mi nu eko in nord California.
Mi nu habe u Mazda vagona.
Mi nu amo u Glosa lingua.
Mi pa glosa u timbra.

Does that make sense?

Kevin

I have a vague feeling that Glosa is more or less a variety of English. That 
is not an adverse criticism and not surprising in that its main developers 
were English speaking - what I tend to do is to write or think in English, 
replace the usual words with posher ones, shorten them and then hey presto, I 
have some quite presentable Glosa. When I follow Robin's advice and think in 
Glosa, I get my knuckles rapped!
    How to think in Glosa ...
A G sentence can be divided into groups of words (pretty obvious but never 
mind).
Each group has a main concept with other concepts reinforcing its meaning, 
some groups also have the concept of relative time others have the concept of 
more or less absolute number.
The time groups relate the whole sentence to the time of writing/speaking or 
to another expression of time that is itself related to writing time.
It helps the reader/listener to be informed at the beginning of the group 
that it is a time group by starting with a word that refers to the time - pa, 
fu, nu, du, (ha), pa-di, Decembre, ko tako etc. sometimes ("es") it is not 
necessary. If you leave these references out, the reader may become unsure 
and puzzled.
The number group would start with u, plu, 765, multi, oligo  and so on.
We now have time groups (VP), number groups (NP) we can put them in Glosa 
order SVO Io
 I have a vague feeling that Glosa is more or less a variety of English
VP - have - present tense - nu-du habe - however the S is "I" which is a 
complete NP, we know easily where it ends and the VP starts so "habe" is 
sufficient
O1 - concept "feel" - number 1 - supporting concept "vague". Number + support 
+head = "u no-klari senti"
O2  - the next group could be "a feeling = G is more....."
so I shall use "iso" ( this avoids the disagreement over ";" and "ke", and is 
probably abetter way) 
We have another sentence - VP ="es" - OK as is -  "Glosa" is unique therefore 
number =1 and is implicit - S= "Glosa" (a logical use for a capital)
O - head =variety, number =u - "more or less" is an idiom, "nearly" might be 
better  
and helps "variety" as does " of English"
so we get :- Mi habe u no-klari senti iso Glosa es u proxi vari de 
Engle-lingua

I found some phrases which have different places for adverbs in
different langs.
I know English well. (not about me)
Ya khorosho znayu angliyskiy.
(Tr. ya= I, khorosho=well, znayu=know)
Mi bone scias la anglan.

In Glosa:
Boni, mi ski un England-lingua.
Mi boni ski un England-lingua.
????

The Sun shines brightly.
Solntse svetit yarko. or Solntse yarko svetit.
(Tr. solntse=Sun, svetit=shines, yarko=brightly.)

In Glosa:
????

There will be more!

Alex.

    . The Idea is to be able to stand back, wearing ones ^research hat^,

    . This is one reason I see the pruning of letters from the Glosa
alphabet as not making sense.
    . When new words are added to a pre-selected short lexicon, we are
likely to find that a new concept logically is symbolised by a certain
spelling BUT this spelling, or something very close, has been selected
already for another word, for which that spelling is not as appropriate.
So, then we might start playing ^musical chairs^ with the spellings, to
jostle the existing lexicon to fit in the new words.
     . Without going out looking for new concepts not already covered
within the present Glosa word lists, it is, I believe, a very good idea to
make sure that all the words we've got, already, fit together neatly,
without unwanted duplications, with standardised spellings, and with a view
to leaving sufficient space between the words, to allow for
as-yet-undiscovered concept-words to be added to the lexicon later.
     . As well as breadth of alphabet, there is also the idea of depth of
wordlength.  So, with more letters, and the allowance for mainly short
words, but with some longer ones, we will have sufficient space for a
comprehensive lexicon.
     . The only word that comes to mind is "overview."  I would like to get
the overview of Glosa right first, before I start establishing subsets of
the lexicon at 2500 and 6500 words.
     . However, if I'm the only one taking this 'holistic' view to
vocabulary-building, then I will work with others, happily, on the
'additive' approach.  However, I am starting to get the feeling that I am
running short of time, and do not believe that we have the luxury of
working at the 'basic research' level endlessly, but should be working to
some sort of 'closure.'

Have been looking at the Esperanto Teach Yourself book. 10 brownie points
for the pronunciation instructions - same as IPA - minus a point or two
for having sqiggly bits on c s and z but I came across these in Croatia -
easy enough.

So now I can make a reasonable shot, as I could in Croatia, at the E
pronunciation after about 5 minutes. The next chapters look rather dull
to me - I don't think  I like E very much. Two things there for G to
learn, use IPA and try to make a brighter book so I suggest something
like the following:- start with a G sentence - U Sud Kremna pa es no sura
u kremna. Id pa es no kline sati.

now the vocab - es=is/be/am/are,  id=it,  kline= slope, kremna=cliff, 
no=no/not,  pa= past (pa es=was),  sati-enough,  sud=south,  sura=sure, 
u=a/the

your reader can now make something of the G without too much bother -
also starts an interest in what might happen next.

an analysis of the construction of G (it has no grammar ......) no jargon
etc if poss

starting with the group of words that have time

"pa" in front of a word makes it in the past - was, "pa habe"=had

  before this group is the subject group "u sud kremna"

"u" tells us that this is the beginning of a name-word-group , the main
word is "kremna" and the word "sud" helps the meaning of the the main
word

We now mention the IPA (and how to get a tape! I am working on that) and
explains the use of the capital letters in "U" and "Sud Kremna"

 the next sentence gets a similar treatment and eventually a simple tale
of a boy wearing out the seat of his trousers sliding down short
stretches of slope (guilty!)

unfolds better, I think than a fairy tale which might put off some adult
readers at this stage.

I might try that in Esperanto, Spial ........ at the moment I have a few
reservations about G and,I fancy, G has some about me so that I feel
doubtful about going further in G  just now. See what Wendy thinks about
thre idea

*   Hi friends,

</fontfamily>      From reading Sid's response, I feel he is on the right
track:-

  . Wendy propably has no time to sit down and type out a Glosa
instruction book.

  . If you, Sid, have time to put your ideas into draft format, then the
best advice is to DO IT.

  . At present, the only instructional book we have is "18 Steps ..."; if
each activist on this List presented the group with one draft of an
instructional book, then we might even have five ideas ready for
development - instead if the one we have now.

  . If people are not precious about their productions, then one, or two,
well thought out instructional books can result from the melding of
elements from the drafts from different Glosa-pe.

  .  While browsing an educational bookshop, I saw a 'Dictionary of
Maths' and bought it with the general plan of trying out the idea of a
"Glosa per numera."  My draft would not actually represent a
Glosa-by-numbers, but more the thought of using different aspects of
counting and quantity, as the prop on which to introduce this strange,
new language.  The draft would probably have facing pages in Glosa and
English.

  .  Although the lexicon conundrum, which is taking too long to unravel,
remains unresolved, there is no reason for some of our number not to be
working on the more creative aspect of writing teaching material.


   Hey Sid, please give an example - scanned from the book, or retyped by
you - of the way that Esperanto demonstrates its use of IPA .. in 
print.


   My reservations are not actually against 'pure research', but they
probably are about the doing of basic research into the form of Glosa,
considering that I am - in some conformist way - attempting to help in
realisation of the fundamental linguistic conception of Glosa's authors. 
And, as well as that, I can recall witnessing the many hours of very
concentrated effort that Ron and Wendy put into the formulation of Glosa
as it now stands.  It really is rather amazing that the language reached
the almost complete form it has achieved - before Ron Clark's unexpected
death. 

   While others may differ on the level of completion in Glosa's present
formulation, I believe that it is time to move on .. with what we have
got .. to the "Application" stage of Glosa's R&D process.  The hic-cup of
inconsistent vocabulary and excess synonyms does present the need for a
retrospective look at the existing lexicon - with a view to standardising
it -- not, as I understand the situation, to fundamentally re-organising
it.

<bold>I am very glad you can percieve this problem.

Is the 'root' spread into two significantly different concepts ..
necessitating, or suggesting, the use of two separate Glosa words to
facilitate spoken communication; or do we keep the one 'root' for both,
but add a hyphenated "generic term" to the 'derived' concept, extending
the original, basic concept?

IE.  Are ~famili~, as a fundamental substantive word, and ~familiari~, as
the derived modifier, sufficiently semantically distant to warrant the
existence of two words in the Glosa lexicon?

IE`. Are the fundamental concepts of 'hunger' and 'famine' so different
as to warrant the existence of two Glosa words?  Alternatively, can a
'generic term' be added, or should a descriptive usage be invented to
cover the more abstract concept of a 'general hunger'?   ~famina~
[hunger], ~famina-ra~ [hunger thing],

~u generali famina~ [general hunger]  ???

*** In the case of ~famili~ and ~familiari~ I prefer the two words;
alternatively, with ~famina~, I would opt to stick with the one
substantive.

N.B. I used human intuition to assist in making this decision: my
conclusion might not sit well with the Chinese or Arabs; other ethnic
groups might have very different cultural associations within the
concepts of 'family/familiarity' and 'hunger/famine', however, I have
tried to use ''culture-free'' thinking in reaching my conclusion.

<bold>Agreed CVCV is mainly for the "Function Words", like ~pote~,
~posi~, ~nece~, etc, but also for the rather common substantives, like
~bibe~, ~fago~, ~domi~, ~aero~, etc: there is nothing wrong with that.=20
However, at no stage did the Glosa authors proscribe words of four
letters with CVCV structure.  They did, however, select roots for their
brevity and ease of pronunciation, and this often resulted in four-letter
dictionary entries.  Also, they deduced that many languages had
'sing-song' qualities, which resulted from the alternation of vowels and
consonants; and so, they sought words that had the alteration of these
two types of sounds; as well, they preferred the smootheness between
words found in languages with terminal vowels on their words.  The
terminal vowel readily leads into the following word, especially if it
has an initial consonant.

   So, it is my intuition that the Glosa authors and Charlse percieved
Glosa words as predominantly of CVCV and CVCVCV structure, but that the
perception is based on different premises.

</bold>

<bold>**  # Gender vowels are only in languages with this unnecessary
item.

    # Again the rare CVC is featured in Glosa "function words", like
~qod~, ~sed~, ~per~, ~six~, ~jam~, ~tem~, ~sib~, etc

    # But I, for one, do not want to take the backward step, of adding a
P-o-S (part of speech) marking vowel, because, Glosa was predicated to
have "words that did not change for reasons of grammar."

    ## Part of the dictionary crisis was caused through Ron's declaration
(circa 1988) that the terminal vowel was of the speaker's choice ..
depending on what sounded right to him.  Soon after this section of the
Glosa experiment was started, and a number of preferred terminal vowel
usages were established, Ron and Wendy terminated the trial, having found
that sometimes the terminal vowel was the only letter separating Glosa
roots with otherwise identical spelling.

</bold>

<bold>*   As it can be seen, I do not agree with the ideas in these last
four lines of Charles's.

</bold>

>I do believe that a CVCV super-productive neutral language like

>Tunu can work. But, Glosa never abandoned use of the international

>(Euro-) vocabulary,

<bold>I guess that the Glosa authors wanted to keep their Glosa 'concept
words' (substantives) as close as possible to the Classical roots, from
which they were derived.  At the same time, they were also keeping an eye
on the way words came out in their subsequent, national-language
manifestations.

Their method was 'Pragmatic Intuitive' rather than algorithmic.

</bold>

>    and the Roget-1000 set is wholly inadequate,

<bold>At this stage, I have no proof that basing a language's fundamental
vocabulary on a generally agreed concept list is any worse, than
extracting the historically derived commonality from languages that
diverged from common sources over the period of thousands of years.

Clark and Ashby did not automatically select the English-language version
of a Roget concept: often the Classically-based English word was related
to many of the other Euro-language versions of a concept, and thus the
resulting choice was recognisable to speakers of English - as it was to
speakers of the other Euro-languages.

<bold>I would guess, Charles, that you have a considered attitude against
the changing of the Latin words that are written with "C" spelling to a
"K".  However, from early in the piece, Ron and Wendy decided that there
were Hard "C"s and Soft "C"s, and they realised that their evolving rule
of Glosa spelling - each letter had one pronunciation - would make more
sense if the symbol for a Hard "C" looked different from that of a Soft
"C".

And, lo and behold, there did exist a symbol, which can be construed to
be a "c" with a stroke through it; and, hence, the Hard "C" was readily
written as a "k".  Meanwhile, of course, this decision would resolve two
other problems: the English Soft "CH" sound could be reduced to only one
letter, if Glosa adopted the Italian "C" sound, as it occurred in `ce-`
and `ci-`; then, the problem caused by the existence of almost identical
sounds in the Unvoiced "S" and the Soft "C" of English, was resolved by
declaring that this sound was to be conveyed by the letter "S" in=20
Glosa.

Needless to say, the puzzle of the Voiced "S" and the sound of the letter
"Z", was ^shaken out^ to result in the use of only one letter to
represent these almost identical sounds: "z".


I recall, on returning to Australia, in 1981, I visited the Professor of
linguistics at Sydney University, and showing him the Glosa dictionary
that I had brought from England: the words were all fairly recognisable,
because they looked very close to their Latin sources.

I tried to find this booklet in my Glosa archives box, but failed.=20
However, I did find a copy of Eduka-Glosa from Summer 1990: it contained
a copy of Glosa 1000 - as it was then - and the C/K distinction had been
made by that time; the wordlist has printed above the "C" entries, "Glosa
C pronounced like Eng. CH".

*   So, there is a quick answer: the capitalisation of Glosa words, while
keeping English (or other national language vocabulary) down at lower
case definitely suits Charles' Perl system.


    If no-one has any objections, this will be the way to go - at least
until we get the standardised dictionaries sorted out.


It is all systems   go .... KI   or    KI .... go.


There is one formatting question: does your system allow the use of
Italicisation and Bold letters?  Does it treat the capitalisation of 

      <bold>KI

     </bold><italic> KI

</italic>and   KI

in the same way, or does it distinguish between them?

*  Charles and Glosa-pe in General, 
    I have not spent time learning Interlingua/Interlingue though I have
looked at these other languages during my time on the Conlang Mailing List.
 The samples I saw did not convince me that I should study the language(s)
but I could still be convinced that the Glosa group has much to learn from
the other initiatives in Planned Language.
    The whole question seems to turn on "word selection algorithms", and,
at present, these are moving into the areas of higher-level technology.
Are we in danger of leaving our 'constituency' behind, in the move to
establish professional credentials for Glosa?
    I will agree that Glosa gives the appearance of amateur effort.
However, that was where it started around thirty years ago, and I am not
convinced, yet, that higher technology, which could streamline and
regularise the language further, would necessarily create a language that
is more user-friendly than Glosa is at present.  Assume that to-morrow the
Good Fairy swishes her wand, and that we end up with a beautiful lexicon,
no sweat.
    Would such a thing solve most of the linguistic problems percieved in
Glosa.
    So, it is still my opinion that the intuitively derived Glosa
vocabulary works as it is, at present.  The matter of removing ambiguities
and unsuitable words, and adding missing ones should be a trivial exercise,
and one that should not cause confusion with Wendy; however, in discussing
the need for some revision of the vocabulary, we have moved from a minor
job to a major overhaul, which I personally feel is unwarranted.

    With reservations over the adversarial situation, of deciding words on
a vote, I am for going ahead with Kevin to set in place at least the
beginner's dictionary.  In statistical terms, I am likely to follow Ron, to
the grave, before discussions reach their conclusions, and before I can
happily publish Glosa as one language.  Do I want to I wait that long!?

    No, Glosa should not be the winner of a beauty contest, but it could be
finalised as a superior medium of communication within a year, or two, if
those interested in it and in the principle of world communication work
co-operatively and serendipitously.

    My guess is that you, Charles, can imagine that Glosa, as it stands, is
completed - with some inbuilt errors - and nobody takes it up.  In such an
exercise modern technologies would be overlooked, and a language that
solves no-ones problems might be consigned to the archives.
    However, I have had enough positive responses from places like Africa
and China, to convince me that the structure is sound.  I would like to
give the memory of Ron Clark and the energy of Wendy Ashby a chance to
demonstrate their creation is a viable language. 
    How can you convince the rest of us on the Glosalist that the
application of intense technology and radical revision of the language
would ultimately prove beneficial to the language and to mankind, in general?

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*   No way.  Mechanical methods might be good, and they could end up with a
Glosa that is the world's best communication medium, but there is no
guarantee of this.
    On the GIGO principle, automation is only as good as the instructions
(algorithm) fed in by humans.
    The method suggested by Kevin could not fail to produce a standardised,
and inevitably more usable, language.  
    With the use of programming methods to select vocabulary for
Interlingua/Interlingue, what was the final conclusion: did people
understand one another better using the mechanically improved vocabulary:
did new learners learn the language more quickly?
    In the case of taking raw glossaries of scientific terms or special
vocabularies from esoteric persuits, a standardised way of converting these
new words into Glosa would be greatly assisted by having a standardised,
well thought out way of doing it.  Such a set of instructions could well be
put into the form of a computer program, and terms could be fed in one end,
with Glosa-looking words coming out the other.  However, such Glosafied
terminology would need to be ^topped and tailed^ by Glosa-pe with
linguistic training, and probably then reviewed by a review board.

*   No memo.  Charles, through his understanding of the moving edge of
technology, and from his knowlege of the application of programming
technology to Interlingua/Interlingue is convinced that such an application
to Glosa will also standardise Glosa.  As yet, we are waiting to find out
the results of this high-tech approach within Interlingua/Interlingue: Has
it allowed people to understand one another better, and are people able to
learn the language more quickly?
    The Glosa authors did not use technology in the development of Glosa's
vocabulary: the authors used their minds inspirationally, looking at the
various national languages, checking this back to the Classical roots, and
testing the resultung vocabulary for sound and feel.  We will all agree
that, had they from early stage, used the basic technology of keeping a
base-lined lexicon on computer, little of the spelling variation that we
suffer from now, would have occurred.
    But, with the authors having done it the hard way, and come up with a
vocabulary that has been tested and reviewed by learners (Glosa's target
population), the current, hand-prepared vocabulary has proved that it
works, and does not need a lot of tweaking.

    Some say the Internet is anarchic: it is our job to learn how to
harness the initiative and enthusiasm of a bunch  of individualists so what
we get out of the system is greater than the sum of the individual inputs
into it.
    I have seen this method work successfully once before with the creation
of the Glosa Tense Table.  Each added his input to the table as he retyped
it and passed it on; there was no conscious plan to co-operate: each simply
added his thing, until the final version emerged, and it was more than any
of us might have imagined. 

    I am waiting for the first chunk.
    Perhaps we could learn from the more humanitarian ways of
decision-making.  Hard-edged decisions do not need to be made on every word
in the first round: there should only be one or two contentious words per
chunk, such that these can be left in Edward de Bono's "Po" until we've all
had a chance to have a second thought.

    I know that others have also created standardised wordlists, and I do
not want to appear partial.  With this concept, I would wish to check out
other people's basic lists (in the range 1000 - 2000 words) while going
through Kevin's list.

   I am more of a concensus person: I'd rather allow us to BRIEFLY state
our objections to a word or spelling; and then, I might like to be able to
suggest the addition of a word that could be, but is not, in the chunk.
   Somehow, in terms of approval and authorisation, I'd say Wendy Ashby has
the power of veto.  So, I we want to keep as many people as happy as
possible, and maintain our official approval rating, we should avoid the
adversarial system, and we should also include Wendy in the deliberations.
   This might reduce time efficiency, but is more likely to enhance the
support of a maximum number of Glosa-pe.

*  Yep.  We have been coasting along at a snail's pace for months, so we
might not be up to such a rapid pace of progress: I feel that two days is a
bit of a short turn-around for volunteer labour.
   So, one ground rule I would suggest is that I post our standardised
chunks to Wendy regularly, though it will still be 'after the event.'

   If we use Kevin's list as the foundation, I would like to have the whole
list, and the chunk break-points in advance, so that I can consider the
lists at times that suit me, because my free time may not coincide with
divisions of the normal calendar.

standardised beginners' word-list.
    Perhaps from this experience, we will build on what we will have learnt
to refine the process to facilitate the processof coming up with the larger
standard dictionary.

*   Yes, mathematically, I can understand your need for rapid throughput:
how many starters will stay the distance, over four months?  If a chunk
takes twice as long, then we are in for an eight-month stint.  I guess your
haste is called for.

*   OK!  Charles has stated his reasons for using the upper and lower cases
.. as they are in the existing Glosa 6000 dictionary, so thats three in
agreement, so far.
    Using Word, I can change slope and embolden text, but I have not, as
yet, learnt to change case.  for me going from 
       kani     dog

to     KANI     dog

would involve retyping.

*  It is my belief, since spending time on Conlang, Auxlang and Glosalist,
that the key skill required for auxilliary language development is critical
thinking - rather than having a mind full of academic ideas about language.
   While I have both a small Greek dictionary and a small Latin one, these
are used in emergency, rather than as major sources for Glosa words.  As my
main tool, I do use the Glosa 6000 dictionary to check my recall of some
words.
   However, the whole thing about world communication is that it must be
fun, and it must work .. in a pragmatic, rather than an academic, sense.
So, I have been in touch with the Ugandans Ron and Wendy contacted, and
found their enthusiasm for a Lingua Munda refreshing.  Unlike
English-speakers who have the luxury of being able to commune across
oceans, Ugandans need a string of interpreters when they travel around
their own country, which is full of native languages.  They must be
wondering what is holding us up, with completing the language tool that
they need now for internal communication.

   The most significant recent piece of Linguistics, relevant to auxilliary
language formation, seems to be the discoveries about pidgins and creoles:
the formation of these trading and 'naturalised' languages is the closest
to the processes involved in  forming Planned Languages.  The first users
of pidgins and auxilliary languages are adults, who struggle to get their
minds around the foreign vocabulary and syntax; subsequent users are the
traders' children and primary-school pupils.  It is the young minds which
convert pidgins and auxilliaries into creoles and living languages.  So,
auxilliary languages must go through a similar two-step process to pidgins
and creoles.
   We, in the Glosalist are obviously in the first stage, which is
equivalent to pidgin formation: we cannot hope to have the plasticity of
mind we had when learning our native tongues; so we must do the best we can
in setting up the 'rules' for Glosa; but  must be prepared for the up and
coming, younger generation to 'normalise' and 'naturalise' the language
before it has the feel of a "native" tongue.
   In short, the present generation of adult Glosa-pe do not have the 'last
word.'  Only when children creolise it, can Glosa become a true living
language.

this is the address of part of my GE dictionary collection from various
sources - contains g1000, g6000, core and other stuff. There is some
repitition , similes, omissions etc but it might be useful perhaps. It
contains only words beginning with "a" as I had a lot of trouble trying
to get the full dictionary in.

The format is basically so that my computer could work on it. "+" is a
Glosa word, "*" is english and "^" is for comments. "r l x q " draw
attention to their presence in case they may cause problems for some
speakers, "PC" or "pc" indicate a plosive followed by another consonant,
again difficult for some speakers the numbers in "[]" show how many times
the word has appeared on glosalist or in PGN - and so on.

Do as you wish with it, if more is wanted I shall try to oblige - I have
the EG version also and it could be sent in bits if desired. I make no
claims for these offerings but they might prove useful in some way

*  I appreciate your concern, Sid,

   Some people do learn native languages that 'linguistically cripple'
them for learning new languages that make fuller use of the human vocal
range.


   However, I cannot see any sense in restricting the possibilities of
global communication for this reason.  The children of people whose
native languages lack P, L, N, Q and X will subsequently, as world
civilisation washes over them, develop the necessary vocal skills, or, if
not, will remain in a linguistic ^backwater^ with their parents.


  I am not being hard-hearted or cruel; this is just pragmatism at its
worst.


  My experience is from living in Cabramatta, the Asian enclace of
Sydney.  Jack can't really speak English: I am assured by other Chinese
immigrants that he comes from an area from which everyone has trouble
trying to learn English.  I met his wife and him the other day, with
their baby.  The child, going to school in Australia, will not suffer
linguistically as do its parents.  Su, a science teacher from China, does
not pass the telephone test for English.  He lived at my place for six
months during which time I attempted to coach him to improve his
pronunciation; however, it is now the same as it was when I first met
him.  After a visit to China, he returned with his wife and three
children.  While Su and his wife are failing with English, his children
would now be able to learn to speak Glosa.

*  Very Interesting!
   While I never thought it would go this far, I am quite surprised to see
that the heavy addition of tense does make the odd parts of speech appear
more understandable.

   However I still feel that the problem belongs to English, not Glosa.

   The Chinese have been struggling with a no P-o-S language for at least
one millenium, and it hasn't stopped them from comprising one sixth of the
World's population.

Thanks Sid,

Robin

I started work on my word list last September. Since then,
*everything* I have written using Glosa, on this list and
elsewhere, has been confined to words and roots from that
list. 

That includes discussions of the language itself, computer
issues, etc. Speaking from experience, Glosa 1.5K works
just fine for everyday use. I think I'm about 50 words
short right now, but many of those missing words aren't
even in GID-Basic, so I've just worked around them using
multiple core words. 

I have absolutely no interest in abstract research.

For the most part, you have done a good job of describing
the process I had in mind when I wrote "vote" (in quotes).
I understand your desire to give Wendy veto power, and am
willing to try it, with a bit of reluctance.

A new chunk would be issued every two days. People could
wait and respond to a three-week-old chunk if they wished.
Of course, their input might not have as much impact if the
main discussion has already taken place.

It's ok, as long as:
1. It doesn't slow us down too much. I'm concerned that
additions might require more debate than tweaks and
deletions.
2. Everyone is ok looking ahead in the list. I suppose
that's actually true for deletions as well, so if we're
doing deletions in the first pass (and I would like to),
then we should probably do additions as well.

Robin and I have agreed, in principle, to a process that
should produce a roughly 1.5K "core" list of Glosa words.
However, this process will be most effective with
participation from other Glosa-pe (as many as possible). 

Is anyone else interested in participating? If I sent out a
chunk tomorrow, would anyone else respond?

I assume Charles does not like the proposed process. Does
anyone else have major concerns about it? 

Does anyone have a new proposal, different from Charles'
"algorithmic" method, and different from our proposed
"consensus" method?

    The person with IQ 110 can guess where the action is: "I" am a man, the
"house" is a brick box; do people have to be told that the funny word
between "me" and "home" is the 'action'?   No!

*  According to my "Gangster English Dictionary and Phrase-book,"
 the "I gun police down," statement is IQ 60 O.K.  But when we rise up the
IQ scale a bit, your self respecting IQ 110 gangster would know there was a
P-o-S marker missing.  He would obviously say:-
   "I gun da police down."
   While there is the sneaking suspicion that the "da" noun marker is
sitting on top of a silent "-ed" marker that fell off the word in front,
the same self-respecting IQ 110 gangster would only use a "did" before the
verb for emphasis, not for tense indication.
  EG  "Yeah Boss, I did gun da police down."
   And while this is all good Linguistic stuff, it has little relevance to
Glosa, because there will be no gangsters in Glosaland.

is very functional!
  Though does it look awkward simply because it is unusual: and could this
simply be a learnt, cultural response, and not necessarily an indication of
some deep psychological truth?

*  I still believe that in an uninflected language, it is more important
than in other languages, to indicate - using punctuation - the starting and
finishing of phrases and clauses: the likely suspects are the same as they
always were, commas, colons, and semi-colons.
   Well, in the "Glosa 1000" booklet of 1984, starting on p22, there are
 five pages about Verboids.  
EG esthe fatiga = tired; dona chromo = colour, stain; lose gyra = stops
spinning.  The first word is the verboid, and the second, which is not a
functioning 'verb', is called the "amplifier"; together they form a 'verb'.
   This form persists in presnt-day Glosa with words like 'gene', 'habe' 
'ki', 'dona' and 'dice', which can all take amplifiers, such as 'anti',
'tele' and 'akuto'.
EG  dice anti = malign; ki tele = go far; dona akuto = sharpen.

   In "Interglossa", starting at p171, there is a whole chapter of them,
EG  Fe acte grafo auto nomina in bibli.
    She is writing her name in the book.

   It is my belief that Clark and Ashby played down the verboid+amplifier
pairs, because they were too hard to explain, and made the dictionary
entries too complicated.
   The authors moved away from compounding roots with verboids to form
'verbs', and went towards the single substantive 'verb'.
EG Fe grafo fe auto nomina in u bibli.
   She writes her own name in the book.

  However, the form is retained in some concepts like "ascend."
EG  Fe pa ki ana u monta.
    She ascended the mountain.

*  I will agree that, apart from the Websites, Glosa dissemination is based
on fairly old technology.  
   We need cassettes, fun comics, and even games using Glosa.  Also, the
pictorial side, at present, does not even compete with the modern media.
   So, as well as making the learning of Glosa a fun activity, the whole
thing needs to be put onto a business basis: people who create Glosa
materials ought to be able to expect a royalties deal with the GEO; few of
us, these days, do something for no payment.
   Now that I have a laser printer, I will have to learn how to print small
booklets on it.  This means, of course I will have to create worthwile
content in a format suitable for printing on a lazer printer.

   The 'Grammar' Ron tried to avoid was page after tightly typed page of

   He did know that all language calls upon the mental function known as
'grammar,' but he tried to streamline the process so that we could leave
Glosa's grammar-load in the brain, where it always had been, anyway.
   It was only as a result of constant requests for hints on Glosa's
grammar that I attempted to tabulate it, deducing it from articles in the
PGN, as would an anthropologist on discovering a new native tongue.

Though we Glosa-pe do not want to imposed tense/mood/aspect distinction on
Glosa learners, I believe that it could be very helpful for those of us who
would write instruction in Glosa, to be aware of this tense/aspect divide.
Were you to give examples of the different English words, and equivalent
Glosa ones, in these three groupings, it could add new understanding to us,
concerning the unconscious mental functions that we, and others, use in our
formation of VERB PHRASES.

Sorry, I'm not qualified to teach.

It's not so complex; just the 3 tense particles, FU PA NU,
and the 2 aspects, DU and a missing particle I call "HA".
Every sentence should use one of them before the verb,
maybe use a pair of them when "precision" is desired.
Aspect particles act like the English -ING and -ED,
except they're pre-positioned instead of suffixed.

> Please make out a full line of possible contents of a VERB PHRASE.  I
> have not previously seen such a schematic representation of what could be

As I understand it, the verb phrase has several "slots" that can
be filled with certain particles or concept-words. Generally only 2
or 3 slots get filled, but it is possible to stuff in quite a few.

   [subject phrase]    [verb phrase]    [object phrase]
   The big black cat   was not eating   the white mouse.

So, ringing changes on the verb phrase, it's apparent that the
tense particles precede aspect:

   is eating, was eating, will be eating <--- NU DU, PA DU, FU DU vora
   has eaten, had eaten, will have eaten <--- NU HA, PA HA, FU HA vora

But from the glosaref.html examples, we know the negative particle
"NE" precedes the tense particles:

   wasn't eating <--- NE PA DU vora

Bickerton said the one essential mood particle is the "counterfactual",
which I take to be SIO in Glosa; it fits between tense and aspect:

   would have eaten <--- PA SIO HA vora

But now I'm troubled by the passive -- is it GE or ES or what?
Using 5 preverbal (auxiliary) slots we could say:

   the mouse wouldn't have been eaten <--- u mio NE PA SIO HA GE vora.

One can imagine an "intensive" companion for NE, maybe "JA".
Glosa has a bunch of so-called "modals" to accompany SIO,
but some don't look like true mood particles to me ... and
there are a bunch of "verboids" to consider, plus adverbs.
So, the entire scheme would be something like this:

1. negative NE, intensive JA
2. tenses: NU, PA, FU
3. modals: SIO, ...
4. aspects: DU, HA(?)
5. passive GE(?)
6. verboids
7. adverbs
8. the true verb

Slot #8 is obviously mandatory, and either #2 or #4 are also
needed for non-telegraphic sentences. The rest are optional;
use of more than a few would be rare and annoying.

Wheresoever this may be unclear, just refer to Bahasa ...

Yes, very clear, and I agree that HA would be a nice
addition.

Also very clear. Thanks for explaining it so well!

It seems to me that #2 is needed "quite often" (and I know
some folks would say it is only needed "rarely". Either
way, I think that #2 can usually stand without also having
a #4. Do others see it that way as well?

   . There must be a more suitable word than 'purists' for such people, and

   . The construction "u-mi" nouns the adjective, converting ~mi~ [my]
to ~u-mi~ [mine].  While I find it an awkward sounding construction, and
thus use it rarely, I think of 'u-mi' as 'the (of) me'.

   Calling on the `Rule of Parsimony` we avoid any unnecessary
phrase-markers, and keep the ~mi~ simple, as it shoild be
   And, amazingly, this .. correct .. Glosa version maps directly onto the
correct English syntax!!!

that the speaker is talking about his own language, and that it is the one
he/she picked up from their first culture, not necessarily from the lips of
his/her own mother, in very obscure cases a distinction - as you indicate -
can be made, to avoid confusion.
   The Modifying Prepositional Phrases would be used, if such distinctions
were needed.

I've been putting together many of the words in various Glosa
dictionaries and trying with much trouble to get them on a web page. So
far there is the above address with the words beginning with "a", the
other letters are hiding in the wings. If anyone wants me to try more I
will do so. There is much to criticise in it  and a fair number of
omissions but it's a start of sorts.

Subject: [glosalist] a tutor perhaps
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 15:51:23 EST

below - if this perishing thing behaves itself for a change- is an idea I 
shall work on for a tutor. It will be different from but complementary to 18 
steps. I have found tht many tutors etc sart you off with a long list of 
rules etc and bog your memory down - here you start with a sentence and an 
analysis follows - if analyses are not your cup of tea , the analysis can be 
skipped or skimped ....... 






"U an nima es Jon Smit e an nu eko in Glosa-landa".

Dictionary:-
an=he/his, e=and, eko=live/dwell, es=is, Glosa=Glosa, 
Glosa-landa(30n30u!)=30deg north,30 deg west(uest), in=in, Jon=a name, 
landa=land/country,  nima=name, nu=now, Smit=a name, u=a/the

His name is John Smith and he lives in Glosaland.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Construction:-
"u an nima" is the first word group, its main word is "nima"
"es" is the second word group
"Jon Smit" is the third word group, its main word is "Smit"
"u" introduces group one, it implies the number "one", there can be a number 
of names.
In group 3, there can be a number of "smit"s
"es" implies time, here it implies "now"
We have a number group, a time group and another number group
The first (number) group is the subject of the sentence.
The second(time) is the verb.
The third(number) is the object of the sentence.
S V O
The "an" in G1/S adds to the meaning of the main word "nima".
The "Jon" G3/O, adds meaning to the main word "Smit"

"nu eko" is G2/V in the second part of the longer sentence.
"nu" introduces V and implies the present time, "eko" is the main word of  V.
"an" is the subject(S), there is only one person.
"in Glosa-landa" is the object(O), "in" is an introductory word, "landa" is 
the main word and there is only one land, Glosa adds meaning to this main 
word.

"Si tu nu skope a tu carta bibli, tu fu detekti (; ke) Glosa landa pa no 
existe. "

a=to, bibli=book, carta=map, detekti=find, existe=exist, fu=future, no=not, 
nu=now, pa=past, si=if, skope=look, tu=you(singular) 

If you look at your atlas you will find Glosaland does not exist. The 
reference is in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!

the sounds of IPA for Glosa will follow soon - I shall record them so there 
should be no copyright problem

I think that there is a glosa dictionary on the following improbable sounding

http://hometown.aol.co.uk/sydpidd/myhomepage/baby.html 
The dictonary is far from perfect but could be useful - it may go from a to e 
or even as far as z if Iam lucky. I think I've merged most of the stuff I 
could find up to about 6 months ago, if there are more places with more 
entries, I'll try to merge them too. Next a G to E version is due.

And it's more difficult for me to read. I have to actually
bring the message up into MS Word in order to view the
message body, because it comes through as RTF.

Actually, that may be because I recently upgraded to a
newer version of my browser (I use web mail). Still, this
RTF stuff is really hard for me to work with.

Sid: Can you configure your email to only send "plain
text"? If you use Outlook or Outlook Express I can describe
how to do so.

Robin: Same question--can you only send plain text?

Subject: [glosalist] hyphens and dictionaries - problems
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 14 Feb 2002 10:39:00 EST

What are we to do with hyphens in dictionaries?
If we include each word with its hyphens as one item, our dictionaries become 
almost impossibly large. If we omit the hyphens and use each hyphenated part 
as one entry, the dictionary becomes more manageable but we lose some 
independant items. Take "puta-me" (com-pute-r) for instance, we have "puta" 
and "me" ( think and mechanism) - "I am working with my think mechanism" ! 
"my with think doer". Would the word "putame" be acceptable? It would soon be 
recognised and would it matter if the word stress  came on the second 
syllable? "putAme". It is important for Glosa that (";" here?) there is a 
wide choice of expressions but from as small a word stock as possible
ad-in , ad in , adin
agri-vegeta , agri vegeta , agrivegeta (perhaps no mare than 5 syllables)
akti-seqe , akti seqe , aktiseqe
akti-verba , akti verba , aktiverba

In full Outlook, go to Tools/Options, and click on the
"Mail Format" tab. Change the "send in this message format"
drop-down to "Plain Text". This will configure Outlook to
send all message in plain text.

Alternatively, you can just change an individual message to
plain text while you are creating it. In the message create
window, there is a Format/Plain Text menu item.

In Outlook Express, you can configure individual entries in
your address book for plain text. Bring up the address book
entry, and check the "Send email using plain text only"
box.

I believe Outlook express also has one or both of the other
features I mentioned in Outlook, but I don't have it here
in front of me. I can check tonight if it will help.

If you're not using Outlook, can you tell us what app you
are using, so one of us might be able to give you specific
instructions for it?

Kevin

*  Thanks Marcel,
   I have printed out many of these files, and will be checking over ideas
of derivation, synonyms in "Core" and missing words.

   The last quarter of Simsyn will be incorporated soon, I hope.  
   Did you start working from the top?  And is the last quarter, to go, at
the tail end of the alphabet?

   Reckon we should wait until you finish this Simsyn --> GID upgrade
before attempting to compile a meld of all the Core Dictionaries.  Also
will communicate with Wendy to inform her of our plans.

Saluta,

I'm not sure I understand the problem with the current
approach, which is that the word list includes root words,
hyphenated words, and words connected with spaces. The
benefit is that it allows readers to make direct
connections between native language words and glosa
"phrases". 

I plan to continue with this approach in MiniG, unless
there is a problem with it. My list will probably have 500
roots and perhaps 1500 non-root entries consisting of more
than one MiniG word.

> Would the word "putame" be acceptable? 

In some cases, perhaps. But generally I strongly favor
keeping the hyphens. They allow for easier root
recognition, both written and spoken (because of accents,
as you mentioned).

Kevin

Excellent. I will work my way through the MiniG words, and

I like this concept. I think it could be very effective.

I assume this would not be the first entry, because it is
quite complex. If you build up to this slowly, it could be
great.

"Word derivation" ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/gwds.htm ):
  Here I was on the wrong way.  I just updated the file.  It should be
  simply like this -- if one likes it or not -- :

#  Glosa words are built from
#  - English foreign words, ...
#  - ... which have Latin or Greek origin and ...
#  - ... which have cognates in the other world languages Spanish,
#      French, German and Russian.
#  - Spelling is simplified (ph --> f, th --> t etc.). 
#  - And: Glosa words are mainly ending on a vowel.

"Synonyms in 'Core'": ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/cosyn.htm )
  http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm is the file I am working on now.
  By this work, parts of the other "word-kitchen-files" have become
  obsolete.
  Removing synonyms of Core, Kevin did a great job, I think.  His work
  should influence all other word lists.

"Missing words" ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/gidmiss.htm ):
  A lot of the "missing words" belong to the simple circumstance, that
  English has more part-of-speek markers than Glosa.  E. g.
    > disappointment (disapunkta - disappoint; disappointment,
    >   but frustra - disappoint)
  ... should be easy to fix: frustra - disappoint, disappointment.

Subject: [glosalist] GE and GENE
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Fri, 15 Feb 2002 07:38:28 -0800 (PST)

Nick has suggested (in a private email), that ~ge~ and
~gene~ are redundant. That they both mean "get, become,
receive", and could be used interchangably. If that is the
case, I would drop ~gene~ and keep ~ge~.

I wanted to get other input on this. At first, they seem
quite different to me. One is "become", and the other is
"receive". But Nick suggested that to "become" is merely to
"receive" a new state. Because Glosa doesn't have different
words for different parts of speech, this actually does
seem to work.

  I become hot
  I receive hotness (heat)

  I become old
  I receive oldness (age)

He suggests that certain English uses of get could be
translated differently:

  I get angry
  I start feeling anger

  I become dead
  I stop living

Or (I can't think of an example now), in some cases "get"
might be translated as "change to" (~muta~).

Thoughts? Should I drop ~gene~?

Kevin

there seem to be 2 different constructions  for ge - ge-verb(aktiverba) and 
ge-noun to get an adjective - confusing.
I suggest that the ge-verb allows one to put the object at the front of the 
sentence - a useful device and that is what this use of "ge" is . U flora pa 
ge-dona per u andro - forget all this passive tense/aspect/mood stuff - the 
flower was the object  , after the verb, is still the object but before the 
verb. Further, If "ge" means that the first noun phrase was the subject, why 
not use it as a particle  immediately in front of the noun phrase it affects?

We need to distinguish between the "by" (source) ~ex~
and the "by" (means of) [instrument used] ~per~ 
markers.

~U flora pa gene dona ex andro per aero-posta.~

where the man is the ~dona-pe~ and 
so ~u dona andro~ 

and the flower is the  ~ge-dona-ra~ 
and so ~u ge-dona flora~.

The word order change, sid proposes, doesn't
seem to aid clarity greatly, but ~ge~ could
certainly be transfered to be used as an
object-displaced-to-before-the-verb
marker, if this is liked.

Can you give some examples? Theoretically, almost 
any Glosa word can be either verb or noun, so is 
there really a difference?

A flower was get-gifted by a man. This particular 
example sounds confusing because 'give' and 'get' 
are natural opposites in English. We should 
probably use a different example to discuss this 
case.

U kani pa vora u flora
U flora pa ge-vora per u kani

A flower was get-eat by a dog
A flower became ate by a dog

That is one way to look at it. But it seems like 
a more complicated way to me, for some reason.

Ge flora pa vora per kani

(Passive) flower eat by man. Hmmmmmm. Seems hard for me to
parse. If ge is modifying the verb (which I still think it
is), then it should go near the verb. Very few things in
glosa affect the whole sentence (qe is the only one that
comes to mind).

~per~ is still wrong here, (say I pedantically).
It should be

~U flora pa gene vora ex kani.~

Compare

~U flora pa gene vora ex andro per kultela e furka.~
A flower was eaten by a man with/using a knife and fork.

~ex~ the source of the action, the "do-er"
~per~ the means by which it was done, the "tools"

The dog did the swallowing, so it is the "do-er".

Hmmm. While probably technically correct, it is hard for me
to mentally translate ~ex~, (which I think of as meaning
'out from') as 'into'. Because ~ex~ and ~extra~ have a
similar sound, I mentally hear:

 The flower was eaten out of a dog. (yuck!)

Perhaps it should be:

  U flora pa gene vora a u kani.

or

  U flora pa gene vora in u kani.

  U flora pa gene vora a u andro per u furka.
  U flora pa gene vora in u andro per u furka.
  U flora pa gene vora de u andro per u furka.

or

  U flora pa gene vora per u andro; uti u furka.

or

  U flora pa andro gene-vora.
  U flora pa andro gene-vora per u furka.

Actually, I would probably just turn it around:

  U andro pa vora u flora per u furka.

It is reasonable (in my mind) for a language to discourage
OVS structure.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 17 Feb 2002 08:51:35 -0800 (PST)

I just noticed the Glosa sample at:
  http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.html

First, it seems to have a sentence structure that I do not
recognize. Second, it does not seem to use "modern" Glosa
vocabulary. Shouldn't we submit an updated fragment?

  Mi pote qe kompar tu ad estiva di?
    Tu es ma kali, e ma modera.

Here's the translation, without which I would have
scrambled to grab the GID word list:

  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

kompar: not in GID
estiva: 1+G (vice termo-tem 1++)
modera: no 1, +, or G

It doesn't help that the original text seems to rely on the
ability of the English word 'temperate' to be applied both
to weather, and also to personality in a complimentary way.

Also, the link to Marcel's site doesn't mention that it is
now available in English, and links to an old URL that
requires a redirect.

I assume Marcel can submit a correction for his link. Can
someone choose a new sample, run it by the group to make
sure it is a good example of how we wish to present Glosa
to the world, and then submit it?

It's all about the marketing, folks.

This is an extract from
http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/shakesp.htm
a page prepared for the Web by Paul O. Bartlett, (1996)
from "PLU GLOSA NOTA" n. 69, Novembra/Decembra 1994

Poetry never obeys the normal rules of syntax, and has a
vocabulary all of its own. The translation is trying to copy
the rhythm as well as convey the meaning.

I agree, a more standard Glosa sample would be preferable.

Saluta,
Nick

Thank you for the advice (My fault: I was sure, I have mailed him.
Now I scanned my "sent messages", and recognized, that I wrote to him
before I had the new domain.).  I will write to him swiftly.  Please
suggest a better sample.  What about:

I would prefer plastika.  "plasti-ma" is not useful, as long plasti is
not in Core (see Kevin's method-page), and it is not clear
("form-material", at first site I would think it is plasticine).
I will change it in my word list in the next update:

  platika --> gets X (expired)
  plastika --> new item, gets ++*G (new Core-word)
  plasti-ma --> new item, gets only G (Greek origin)

Please write, if you do not agree.  Thank you.

Perhaps 'ex' should really be 'extra de'? Otherwise, this
seems reasonable.

Lots of very small words, which has pros and cons.

This has several words that aren't in Glo, so I like it
less.

Does 'eko' really not require a preposition, because the
'in' is built in? It sounds strange to me. Also, I would
put another 'u' after proxi, but then I generally err on
the side of too many articles rather than too few.

Of these, I think I guess 'Paris' is my favorite. I'll take
a look at 18 steps and the GBR and see if I can spot any
other candidate passages.

We have 2 main noun phrases. S and O
normally the order would be SVO, sometimes we want to change that order to 
OVS.
If the particle "ge" is in the verb phrase, the order is OVS, if there is no 
"ge" particle, the order is SVO. There is no need for "per" nor "ex" to 
express passive/ word order change.
U kani pa vora plu flora - Plu flora pa ge vora u kani
U kani du vora plu flora - Plu flora ge vora u kani
I know English and no doubt others mess about with the verb phrase and add 
"by" to what was the S, But there is no need for Glosa to slavishly imitate 
E.
The flowers were/are being eaten by the dog - the Glosa is much neater.
- and dogs do eat grass and flowers, it's good for their digestion( if they 
are the  right flowers - dogs are not daft)

I'm not feeling very creative this morning. Here are a few
more candidates out of 18 steps. I'm not sure I like any of
them better than 'Paris', but they all seem reasonable to
me. Some words might have to be cleaned up.

On further reflection, it would be nice to have an upbeat
sentence, so let's not go with dying fish.

While we were going up the mountain, it started to rain.

But it can also be used with an adjective:
  ~ge-grafo~ = written. 

There is no SVO context at all here--just a word, so the
ge- rule can't be quite that simple.

But it looks like it is? the 'active' form of written (excuse me, i'm not so well 
in English grammar) is writing isn't it?

a writing man
a written letter

so, if you more precisely say:

if you apply ge- on a glosa word used as a verb, it conserves the very same sence 
of the verb with the only difference, that in sentences S and O are exchanged 
with adding the necessary helpverbs and prepositions: (excuse me again, i joined 
glosa only a few days ago):

a person writes a letter
u pe grafo u grama   

a letter iswrittenby a person
u grama ge-grafo u pe

and this adjective would not be written but bewrittenby, so

a writing person
a bewrittenby letter

this is what i think glosa means by simple concepts

(Here are some semi-technical terms to play with.)

> We have 2 main noun phrases. S and O normally the order would be SVO,

There is always one main noun phrase, the SUBJECT/TOPIC.
The rest of the sentence is called PREDICATE/COMMENT.
Glosa chooses the most common alignment, known as
TOPIC-COMMENT or SUBJECT-PREDICATE phrase order.

> sometimes we want to change that order to OVS.

We can use HEAVY TOPICALIZATION via LEFT DISLOCATION:
"The canary, the cat ate it." But there are two other ways
to do it, a bit more complicated.

Using prepositional CASE MARKERS we can rearrange more
than just the S and O, and mesh more smoothly with the
DISLOCATIONS above: "About the canary, the cat ate it."
"To the cat, I give the bird." "In the cage, a canary was."

The 3rd possibility is use of grammatical PASSIVE VOICE:
"The bird is given to the cat by me." English and Glosa
both seem confused about which particle to use for this,
BE/GET or ES/GE(NE).

> But there is no need for Glosa to slavishly imitate E.

CASES (prepositions) are needed anyway, to distinguish
the different passive constructions. It's even possible
to eliminate the COPULA and VOICE particles entirely.

> dogs are not daft

Not if they're cats. (How many "core" animals would
the vocabulary minimizers allow onto their ark?)

In my unofficial core list, I had about 20 fairly specific
types of animals. 

In Glo, I have none. It just seems unfair to include 'cat'
just because "we" happen to keep them as housepets. Or to
include 'horse' but not 'elephant' and 'camel', which serve
a similar purpose in other parts of the world. Once you
start including specific animal names, where do you stop?

If you need to refer to an animal that doesn't have a name,
you can describe it: "big grey long-nose working animal".
You can also give it a name at the same time that you
describe it for the first time. "This is a story about
three Ursu. An ursu is a large, furry animal that can be
very ferocious".

Hi Kevin, thanks for your suggestions.

But it's striking (dramatic).

Lots of very small words, which has pros and cons.

I do not like relative clauses without pronoun.

I would add an ";" before "seqe-co".  Else fine.

Now I have just mailed to Richard Kennaway and suggested

1) An ne pa pote memo plu verba; seqe-co an pa merka u
   verba-bibli.
   [He couldn't remember the words so he bought a dictionary.]
2) Tem na pa eko in Paris; mu pa visita na bi kron.
   [While we were living in Paris, they visited us twice.]
3) Plu piski pa lose bio; kausa un aqa pa ki ex piski-va.
   [The fishes died because the water leaked out of the tank.]

I wonder, which (or whether) he will choice.  Greetings - Marcel

I feel that if we have a particle that tells us the construction, it would be 
wiser to use it the one way. In the case of "ge" it might be better to do 
something else for the adjective - don't know what .....

Saluta,
  P.S.  I will force the message into .txt format when I save it, and will
be interested to see how it turns out.   R.

 P.P.S.  The long-named attachment was made first; the "Plain" file was

And it's more difficult for me to read. I have to actually
bring the message up into MS Word in order to view the
message body, because it comes through as RTF.

Actually, that may be because I recently upgraded to a
newer version of my browser (I use web mail). Still, this
RTF stuff is really hard for me to work with.

Sid: Can you configure your email to only send "plain
text"? If you use Outlook or Outlook Express I can describe
how to do so.

Robin: Same question--can you only send plain text?

Grati,

Kevin

From: <hzi{at}uol{dot}com{dot}br>
Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 19:11:58 -0200 (BRST)

Hello-

	Please remember that Microsoft Word .doc files are not an
international standard, because it is a "closed" (i.e., proprietary)
standard. Is is not an internationally recognized and adopted
technical standard.
	Only users of the Microsoft Operating System can view these
files properly (also, Word-compatible products). Windows is not the
only operating system in widespread use today, even though you might
think it is. 
        Word files are also inadequate: they waste too much disk space
and bandwidth. If you, like me, must triage 500-plus e-mails a day, you
do not want them taking close to 10 times the amount of space and
bandwidth that is really necessary.
	Additionally, from a technical point of view it is an
unreliable format, with horrible backporting. No garantee you will be
reading your files in, say, 10 years time. Plus, they are a well-known
ideal media for the spreading of viruses.
	So in respect for those that are not victims of that monopoly,
please choose to send your files in internationally accepted
communication formats: you might send the in plain text, or, in the
case special formatting is needed, send an HTML file.
	Word files are easily converted to HTML. Just choose "Save
As..HTML" and we'll all be fine.
	Please be so kind as not to "push" your choices to other
people. This is nothing but good old Netiquette.
	
	Thank you,

	Henry

*  I don't think so.

   Such contractions have caused the devil of a problem in Esperanto.

   Please note: we do not hear the actual hyphen in spoken language;

but, the space it occupies represents a BREAK in the sound.  So, in the
same way that "break-in" and "breakin'" are sounded differently in
English, then ~puta-me~ and ~putame~ will be sounded differently in
Glosa!

   If my e-mail program's 'underlining' works on your computer, you will
see that the first Glosa word has two accented vowels, while the second
Glosa word has only a single, but different, accented vowel.         


        p<underline>u</underline>ta-m<underline>e</underline>     versus 
   put<underline>a</underline>me


   Can I say these look and sound quite different, and, possibly, they
could be different, semantically, as well.

*   No!  The use of a semi-colon in Glosa before a relative pronoun is to
^signpost^ the start of an ADJECTIVAL CLAUSE.

    EG  An dice de Glosa; qi habe boni soni, dona hedo a mi oti.

                      ^   [ ..............]   Clause modifies "Glosa"


        An dice Glosa ta forti, ke plu-pe; intra plu peri strada, pote 

                           ^    [ ........]                       [.... 

audi an.

...... ]  Clause modifies "forti" - probably an ADVERBIAL CLAUSE.


N.B.                                       [ xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ] This
clause is an ADJECTIVAL CLAUSE: it is introduced by a semi-colon, and the
words, "qi es" between the semi-colon and the "intra" have been elided.

   I do know that Paul Bartlett has said that hyphens have no meaning for
spoken language.  However, as demonstrated above, I will have to say that
I disagree with him, and that I believe the hyphen - in joining roots in
a compound - has semantic/syntactic value equivalent to that of the
normal marks of punctuation.

*  All I can say is that meaningful conversation and enjoyable letters
carry evocative description, and avoid repetition.

   I could try to exchange experience and ideas with someone using a
"toy" vocabulary, but I would soon tire of the exercise because of
lexical restrictions, and also, because I would find myself being
repetitious.

   All that being said <<ko dice-co>, I do understand that learners of a
language prefer to get into using it, by starting with small, meaningful
chunks: I prefer to think of Kevin's "MiniG" as a first chunk of Glosa. 
People can happily absorb this small, 500-word, vocabulary, and start
making valid sentences using it.

   As long as MiniG is a subset of Mega-Glosa, then everything works:
people can grow in Glosa usage by additively progressing from the
smallest vocabulary to the next, and so on.  With such a scenario,
uncertain learners could try themselves out with MiniG, then, as their
confidence grew, they could expand their usage to "Core Glosa", meanwhile
understanding more of Glosa's syntactic possibilities, as well.

   Adventurous souls would soon discover the need to expand their lexical
range beyond that of Core's 1500 words, and would obviously buy (or
download) the vocabulary that was the next step up, possibly a 'Mega
Glosa' or a 'Glosa 5000'.

   As long as the spelling and word range in all of these vocabularies
was consistent and additive, then we would have a comprehensive range of
vocabularies, and people could develop linguistic confidence in their use
of Glosa, in a progressive manner.

   I trust that the thoughts I have expressed, here, are congruent with
the thoughts of others on the List.


   Such graduation, within the Glosa-learning process, could cause
further complications for Wendy .. in the preparation of Plu Glosa Nota. 
But, we would have to find the ceative way around such a challenge.


Saluta,


Robin

*  I agree completely with Kevin.
   This sentence should be given as two separate ones to begin with.

   If this was to be a group effort, what sort of decision-making process
would work?
   For instance,  ~U an nima ~  is not the way I would say it:-
    . I'd start with ~An ~,
    . The GID favours ~nomina~ over ~nima~, and I tend to get with the
strength on this sort of thing.

   And then there's the question of which 'verb' goes with "having" a name!?
   I have thought that  ~An habe u nomina, Jon Smit, ~  is more in the
spirit of Glosa than using the 'name = Jon Smit' formula.

   So there, I haven't even got half-way through the sentence and I am
'quibbling' over usage.  Is there a workable formula to streamline the
process of finding the most suitable usage?  And can such a formula include
Wendy Ashby in an adjudicator's role?

   On the question of teaching strategy, I imagine that earlier sentences
might be:

      U-ci es u persona.

      An eqa un andra.   OR    An es un andra.

   Without going on further, I wonder what method we could adopt to 
come up with a teaching book that satisfies all.
   While the majority of Glosa effort has been put into the lexicon, when
are we to sort out the syntax and usage?

   If we, as a group, have trouble in reaching consensus on the usage, then
the language will not work.  Most learners will take the usage that is
given to them, and will not attempt to creatively vary such given language.
 Were the members of this List to reach agreement among ourselves on the
usage, then the syntax we demonstrate, will be taken up by other learners
... as it stands.

   The question remains: can we Glosalistas come to agreement on how the
language should be used!?

Saluta,

Robin

Of course, I still disagree about this, but I know I won't
be able to convince you. 

I agree that using an occasional non-core word to express a
specific or complex concept, makes sense. My concern is
that by having a large vocabulary available, and using it,
we will force readers to have to learn more of the language
than necessary. 

Frequent use of non-core words may be poetic, but it
impedes the flow of information. And for me, the ONLY
reason to be using an IAL instead of a native language it
to maximize the flow of communication worldwide.

I do believe this is important, but also feel fairly
strongly that the few "radical" word changes I have made in
Glo should remain. If they are adopted by Glosa, that would
be ideal. If not, I suspect that Glo will remain slightly
different. Note that this only covers about five words, and
the Glo versions of those words should be recognizable by a
Glosa-pe.

As an aside, I would now propose that if the group is going
to step through a "core" word list, that we should step
through the Glo word list. At least in theory, those most
core of core words should be ones that we all agree should
be in the language, and they tend to be ones with fewer
questions about spelling and meaning.

   'I wish to hear from you' is an English-language idiom.

   ~audi~ & ~auxi~ are not the same category of things, so do not work
with the conjunction, ~e~.  Possibly:  Mi fo volu auxi, e vo gene ex tu
plu verba; tu puta ... ~ 


    In Glosa 6000, ~klu~ = "even".  I feel that ~inklude~ is the right
word, here.

   These compounds, which would be necessary to describe airplane and
milk, are better left out of MiniG: as a very first vocab, there would be
plenty of 'Mega Glosa' words to play with; also, such compounds add
confusion, in that they would have to be unlearnt, and replaced with the
MG words, when the learner expanded his vocab to 'Core' or 'Mega 
Glosa.'


  Either MiniG is presented without the possibility of compounding and
the use of hyphenated generics, or it includes these higher-level
constructions.

  In the former case, learners would be introduced to the generics and to
the art of compounding, when they moved on from MiniG to something more
comprehensive; if, on the other hand, the art of the hyphen is included
in MiniG, it could cover only some listed compounds, or it could cover
listed compounds plus the generics (-pe, etc), however such inclusions
would detract from the elegance of MiniG as a non-inflecting,
non-compounding "toy" language.


  I, at present, see MiniG as a sort of ^piglet Latin^ version of Glosa. 
After completing, later to-day, <italic>Tri Ursus - in MiniG, </italic>I
will be in a better position to tell if this impression is the right
one.

According to the Eudora user manual (available from their
website):

You can select your preferences for sending text by going
to the Tools menu and choosing Options. Scroll through the
category list and select Styled Text. There, you can choose
'plain', 'styled', or 'both'. For this list, 'plain' would
be best, and 'both' (which is the default) should be ok,
but doesn't seem to be.

Note that by choosing 'plain', you will lose the ability to
underline, bold, set colors and fonts, etc.

The other important thing is to never send a message as an

This is an excellent question. And I would propose a
similar solution to my proposal for 'regularizing' the
vocabulary: Take a tutorial, work through it in chunks, and
attempt to build consensus. The tutorial could be 18 steps,
Glosa Basic Reference, or any new tutorial that Sid or
anyone else has created by the time we were ready to begin.

I'm inclined to think that vocabulary should come first,
because then we won't have to quibble (as much) about word
selection when we are trying to focus on syntax and
structure.

    The hyphen both maintains the integrity of the language, and informs us
that a compound has been formed.  Also, it leaves the reader in no quandry
as to the pronunciation of the constructed 'word.'

the vocabulary learning task for new-comers.  By including unlimited
compounding in the definition of MiniG, we end up with a miniturised

    Such a broad definition removes the concreteness of a non-compounding
"baby language" and causes the learner to use abstract thinking: this would

    Should I start re-telling The Three Bears using the 500 root-words

    Urgently, here, I put in a case for POETRY.  People will want to
write poetry using Glosa - using the language to convey the nuances of
meaning that the poet relishes.  So, the difference between 'stopping
living' and 'becoming dead' could be the crux of a whole poem: do we have
the right to deprive future generations of the subtlties permitted by
having a range of meanings in the semantic catalogue?

    In the same vein, creative communicators will wish to hold the
thought that their prose, in Glosa, as in other languages, can be
described as having poetic quality.  If we are to be "lexical
economisers", we might also function as "creative writer excluders."


>Or (I can't think of an example now), in some cases "get"

>might be translated as "change to" (~muta~).

>

*   For poetry, again, I would argue that there are many cases when the
concept of "change" is not interchangable with that of "becoming."  And
in a more mundane argument, I would suggest that these two concepts often
work, syntactically, in different ways.

    :A hot day:

         Id gene termo.

         U-c di pa habe fo termo.

         Nu-di, u meteo du muta ex frigi a termo.

         Nu, u temperatura eqa mo hekto grada.

         

>Thoughts? Should I drop ~gene~?

>

*   NO!

    And ~ge-~ is a perfectly legitimate abbreviation of ~gene.~

    While the use of ~ge-~ as  prefix represents the only bit of
inflection in Glosa - whereby tense (aspect or mood) modification is
attached to the substantive 'verb' - it does overcome an otherwise sticky
problem: the participle in Passive Voice.


   EG  U bola pa bate an.     An pa gene ge-bate ex u bola.

Certainly we do. (I write that about half with sarcasm, and
half with seriousness). As language designers, we choose
whether or not there is a word for the little flap of skin
between your toes. We choose whether to have different
words for wet snow and dry snow.

The degree to which we include synonyms in the language
goes right to the heart of why we believe one would use an
IAL. And you and I already know that we disagree on this
point. I trust and hope that this particular issue will not
prevent us from continuing to work together in other ways.

> If we are to be "lexical economisers", we might

If so, I could live with that. On the other hand, a
language with fewer words can require great creativity to
construct a sentence with just the right meaning. And
Glosa's (and Glo's) ability to interchange parts of speech
allows still more options.

Perhaps when I get back to translating the Tao into Glo I
will change my mind, but I doubt it. Of course, we must all
remember that I am only setting the course for Glo, and not
for Glosa. I expect Glosa will always retain its 2000 to
6000 word vocabulary.

Up until that point, I was pretty much planning to leave
them both in, with ~gene~ meaning obtain, and ~ge~ meaning
become and/or handling the passive voice. But as soon as
you tell me that they are interchangable, I feel an
uncontrollable urge to remove one of them.

Respectfully,

Kevin

*  I find that syntax is the final arbiter in Glosa.
   By syntax, I mean the natural order of the words; and by 'natural order'
I think of the way that the mind prompts us to sequence the symbols of
thought, which we call words.

   IE     "Ge flora pa dona per andro"
 glos.  [got-done flower did give by man]       
           Flower was given by man.*

     Note, in trying to make this unthinkable glos seem like English, I had
to import a VERB: this was "to be" in the form of 'was.'

     When Ron Clark acknowledged the need for a Passive Voice in Glosa, he
chose the construction:- 

         GOT/GETS  X-ed/en

      Now "get" is a perfectly respectable English word, and ~gene~ is a
fair representation of it.  So, Ron, harking to German, where, it seems,
the "-ed/en" of English is given as "ge-", he did some quick cross-breeding
of the languages, and declared that the abbreviation of ~gene~ , like some
weird "getted" or "gotted", would make the action into a particle, and thus
~ge-akti~ was "done".

  EG   An pa akti id.
       [he did do it]
        He did it.

       Id pa gene ge-akti ex an.
       [it did get en-act from him]
        It got done by him.   

  I find that the three-line example satisfies me in such a way that I can
relate my thinking in Glosa to my thinking in English.

  As long as the middle line, called the 'glos' in linguistics, relates
clearly upwards to the Glosa, and downwards to the English vernacular form,
I can see, imagine, and feel the relationship between the two languages.

  One trick is to be speaking (or writing) in Glosa and to be thinking in
English (or other native tongue) at the same time.  This is not
recommended; however, if it is possible, then a logic can be percieved in
Glosa, and the language makes sense.
  If there is no sensation of relativity between Glosa and a person's
native tongue, then he cannot develop a confidence in Glosa's rules, and
cannot learn to 'think' in Glosa; consequently, we would have to admit that
the Glosa Project had failed.

  On the other hand, if the syntax-based language, Glosa, can be shown to
have a satisfying, and people-friendly system of syntax - that can be
related to that of people's native languages - then there is still hope for
the Glosa Project.

I have not, as yet, seen a better Passive form, for Glosa, than that
concocted by Clark and Ashby.

Yes, in my mind there was a stronger marker before the e.

GID lists klu as: even; even (including); even (still);
including; still (even)

In Glo (formerly MiniG), generics are no longer a special
case. As with Glosa, you can add a hyphenated root to the
end of any other root or word. In Glo, I eliminated those
generics that conflicted with regular words (mo, te, ka),
and those that didn't seem very useful (zo). Others (fa,
fi) have become full words, and so can be used as generics,
or as regular words.

Why? Aside from the issue that ~go~ is not a Glosa word,
would it ever be incorrect Glosa to refer to a plane as
~vola-go~ (or ~vola-vagona~)?

Glo includes a core set of about 500 roots. Having learned
these, it should be possible to understand whatever
compounds a Glo author has chosen to use. I do not see the
conflict. 

It is important to have the compounds in Glo to give
writers ideas for how to translate English words into Glo
when there isn't a Glo root that meets the need. I have
split the Glo materials to have a separate "root word
list", as opposed to the list that also includes compounds.

Glo will be able to stand as a language on its own. It is
certainly not a "toy", nor is it intended to be training
ground for people on the way to Glosa (although some people
may end up using it that way, which would not bother me at
all).

I eagerly await your Glo version of Tri Ursu.
Unfortunately, Glo is a bit of a moving target at the
moment--I am still adding or removing perhaps two or three
root words a day. I'm assuming you will encounter some
words that you feel you cannot do without, and those would
be candiates for addition to Glo.

I also overhauled the internal storage of my website, so if
you had bookmarks to the old MiniG materials, you'll need
to update them.

Use compounds. Glo compounds are _suggestions_, not words.
As long as the reader can figure out what is meant, it
makes no difference whether your compounds are from the Glo
list or not. Just like Glosa.

If you like ones that I have listed, feel free to use them.
If not, make up your own, as long as they literally and
unambiguously convey your meaning. If you invent some good,
logical compounds, I'll want to add them to Glo.

My goal is to have a list of Glo compounds that covers at
least a few thousand English words. I'm up to about 2500
already. Most of the growth in Glo over the next few weeks
(?) will be in the form of added compounds.

--=====================_1014646243==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Mi Plu Amika,
  Here is a progress report: it is taking a little longer than expected -
with finding alternative, more generalised words - to replace the broader
Mega Glosa language of "Tri Ursus," but this is what it looks like so far.

  Yes, I AM struggling with the 500-word "toy" language of Mini Glosa, and
seriously suspect that five hundred words might be not enough.  Kevin's
selection of words, also, could be skewing this miniture vocabulary away
from an easy treatment of the mythical pastoral scene, when bears roamed
the forest of Europe.

 # I had trouble traslating "Tri Ursus" to "Tri Bruno Zoa" because of the
lack of the following words:-
    foresta
    ursus
    tabla
    spatula
    vesti
    sed
 
 # I took the liberty of adding some words because alternatives could not
be found, and they could not be otherwise constructed:-
    ju-fe
    voci
    plura 
    flori
    place

  As far as I can judge, such a miniture language would be beneath the
dignity of most adults, but would provide endless fun to children.  For
this reason, I believe that ~ju-fe~ and ~ju-an~ should be in it, together
with ~juve.~  The natural world got too brief a look in for me, with too
few parts of the body, many natural daily activities not covered, and parts
of the day plus seasons of the year absent.
  While I'm not saying that telling children's stories is the main part of
Glosa's task, I would suggest that it is an excellent place to start; and,
also, the case for Glosa will be won, or lost, in the primary-school
classrooms of the world.  Eventually, IF those in charge decide to run off
a trial, of the short-list of Auxilliary languages, the test population
will not be Linguistics Professors, but primary-school children from around
the world: I believe that our "Starter Vocabs" should be purposely designed
to be 'child friendly' for this reason.

The first third of "Tri Bruno Zoa," which ought to be in the body of the
message, and which was typed using Wordpad, follows: ........

As we discussed, specific animals are problematic in any
language with a small vocabulary. Even in full Glosa, we
don't distinguish between breeds of dogs, for example.
Bruno-zoa seems fine.

>     tabla
plano-stru [Note: The use of ~stru~ here may be the most
controversial Glo root yet. I wanted a word that covered
both furniture AND fixed appliances and implements (such as
a bathtub or fireplace). 

~mobili~ was too long (since furniture is so common), and
~-mo~ conflicted with ~mo~. So the current word ~stru~
means "constructed item, furniture, fixture, implement
(n)". 

If Glosa-pe feel it is too misleading to redefine ~stru~
this way, and if nobody can come up with an existing Glosa
word to fill this purpose, then I might end up having to
invent my first ever Glosa root.

I hope not. I guess each person can decide for him or her
self.

I've added quite a few words of nature, but it's probably

I have added them.

I absolutely agree that they should be child-friendly, for
a variety of reasons.

Thanks for submitting it in pieces. It helps me get a sense
of direction. My initial cut of words was done VERY
quickly, so I'm still trying to sort out the final list.
Originally, for example, I was woefully short of materials
and textural qualities. Hopefully most of the major gaps
have been filled, but I still have a pending list of about
20 major concepts that I'm trying to figure out how to add
in a sensible way.

will be able to read it.

That's impossible; more plausible would be:

Actually, GENE appears to be a "passive voice particle",
whereas GE is a "passive participle". GENE can now be
confused with ES, and users can wonder if there is also
an active participle (as in English). I'd prefer to:

1. drop GENE and instead use ES (for the passive voice)
2. keep GE but also use DU (for the pair of participles)

In that case, "es dona per" would be sufficient.
The "participles" might also serve as the "aspects",
but it would need testing ... still not comfortable
with the placement of the passive voice particle:

U flor pa es ge dona per/ad Jo.  =  A flower had been given by/to Jo.
U flor pa es du dona per/ad Jo.  =  A flower was being given ...
U flor pa es dona per/ad Jo.     =  ...  was given by/to Jo. (no aspect)

Just idle speculation, of course. (Jo was a unisex nonce-name.)

Thank you very much for this. I found it to be very clear
and well-written. I have a large number of suggestions,
some of which are specific to Glo, others which would also
apply to Glosa, and some which areas that my own language
skills are lacking.

I took a quick glance at the original Glosa version, and I
find this Glo version to be much easier to read. Perhaps
that's just me. I would be interested in comparisons from
other folks, especially after my Glo suggestions have been
incorporated (or not, at Robin's discretion).

I don't have the ability to add an attachment to this
email, so I'll paste my comments (entwined with the story
itself) below.

Again, thanks for doing this Robin. It's great. I'd love to
put it up on my website when you finish.

literal.

lived in a building, or if this is a cave (~kavita~), or
perhaps just a living place (~eko-loka~).

~heli-proto~ and ~pre-meso-di~, but I like ~proto~ better
in this context.

change ~plu ungu~ into ~plun ungu~, so why have exceptions

I now see that he wasn't merely choosing. He was dictating
that the family WOULD walk. So ~judika~ still works, or
perhaps you could work ~krati~ in somehow.

Thanks, sid, for the miss-attribution!

I was quoting Robin, and saying that there
should not be a ~ge-~ in this sentence in 
standard Glosa.

ie  it should be ~An pa gene bate ex u bola.~


Personally, I don't see a compelling reason
for the change you are proposing, but I 
agree, it is quite possible to do things in
this way, with ~Ge~ marking an inverted
word order sentence paralleling ~Qe~ marking
the change from normal word order to question.

Saluta,
Nick

sorry, I just selected, copied and pasted - the editor did the 
mis-attribution

An pa gene bate ex u bola.~
I agree, we don't need both ge and gene, in this sentence "gene" tells me 
that the subject/object order has been reversed - passive voice/tense/mood 
etc are needless complications in explanations
I was suggesting that "ge" or even "gene" at the front of the sentence echo 
the particle at the beginning of a phrase pattern in Glosa and would make 
things even more regular. As it is, placed in front of the head verb means 
that we have got well into the sentence before we learn that the S "an" is in 
fact the O and have to sort things out afresh - rather confusing.
