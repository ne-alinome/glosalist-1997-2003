I think we can discount the "one of possibly many" 
meaning of 'a', as "'the' city" is also "one of possibly many." 

So, it's 'the', if it's already been mentioned, and 'a' if it's
not previously known or specified. So, that means the 
context decides which is appropriate. Therefore, it is
redundant.

Nick

Salutam karo Charles!
I'm sorry to write such a small messge, with a great number of mistakes, but
I had no time.
I think that we must use "plu" or "u" for the starting of noun-phrase.
The three phrases in Russian are very similiar. They don't use any word for
meaning of article. And in glosa they should use only "u" for singular and
nothing else.

Alex without time.

I agree. U/PLU are just singular/plural markers, not really articles.
Asians will prefer to elide them in many cases. To express definiteness
requires different particles (determiners). Any determiner can serve
to mark the beginning of a noun phrase (mainly, the direct object).

One feature I want to add to my word list is to indicate
which words automatically begin a noun-phrase, and which
automatically begin a verb-phrase. I'll be looking to y'all
to help me figure those out.

*  Plu Amika,

     I agree that the meaning of "determinants" and the functions of "u" and "plu" do not necessarily match up.

     However, because for me, an English-speaker, the "a" and "the" of English are part of my thinking pattern, I have uncritically accepted the Glosa dictionary listing:-

        U  =  the, a

      PLU  =  the (plural)


     And, in general, I find no difficulty in locating these particles at the start of NOUN PHRASES where they seem appropriate.  But, where a numerator is used, it is fairly obvious that either U or PLU are not needed.


    Plu ju-an pa trans u via.    ( a number of boys; one road )


    Tri ju-an trans bi via.      ( 3 boys; 2 roads ) 


BUT  Plu tri ju-an; qi habita u proxi viki, 

    [the  3  boys  who live-in the nearby village]


    pa trans plu bi via; alelo na viki. 

   [did cross the 2 roads (which are) beside our village]


   Did I use ~plu~ as a "determinant" in both of these cases, or was I simply trans-scribing my English usage into Glosa?

   If there are only three boys in the next village, these are they.

   If there is a particular pair of roads running beside our village, then these are the same two roads.


   But hey: the next village is full of boys, and our village is at a cross-roads of at least five roads.  So, I might say:-


     Tri ju-an; qi habita u proxi viki, 

    [ 3  boys  who live-in the nearby village]


     pa trans bi via; alelo na viki. 

   [did cross 2 roads (which are) beside our village]


       We can't actually specify the boys, but we do know they are three from the nearby village; and, they did actually cross two of the roads, which run by our village.


   Perhaps in English there is also such mixed usage of "the" and "a": determinant and comfy 'noun-marker.'

 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

   Real problems used to present themselves for me in Glosa, when I specifically wanted to use the "a" [one of] function, and also when, in English, I would naturally say "some" [an amount of].

   Nowadays, I use ~uno~ [= one of the] to specify an un-named singularity.

  EG  Uno andra pa kine-auto to un antero de u grega.

     [a man did move himself to(position) the front of the group]

      A man stepped to the front of the group.


   We do not know who he was, so we cannot say "the" man, but he was probably the group's spokesman.


   And for years I thought there could be a Glosa word, like ~des~ [of the] to translate the general usage of "some" in English.  But, in trying to fit in with the Ashford dictionaries, I decided that Glosa did, in fact have two "somes"

   IE   plura = several   ......  for COUNTABLES, and

        mero de = part of   ....  for NON-COUNTABLES.


 EG  Tem intra u kuko-ka, plura de plu gyna pa fago (u) mero de u kasea.

    [while in the kitchen several of the women ate a part of the cheese] 

     While in the kitchen, some women ate some of the cheese.


     Well, this sort of word game keeps me happy ... and it might be good Glosa as well.


Saluta,

*   All true.

    But isn't it a little terse, Charles?

    I have not followed the thread, so don't know who made the prime statement.  I do not know which "it" we are talking about.


    However, the general rule in Glosa is that context is highly significant, because, with the lack of morphological grammar, the placement of the words is more important in Glosa than in most other languages.


    The gist on "determiners" is that 'U' and 'PLU' are quite handy as NP markers, and probably should be used if there is nothing else to 'flag' the NOUN PHRASE. 

    However, if you have other words (more substantial ones) leading up to the 'noun' (= substantive word functioning as a noun), then 'U' and 'PLU' can happily be elided - as long as the remaining words leave the reader/listener in no doubt about plurality, or otherwise ... if it was the intent of the utterer to be specific about this.


    EG  Kloro dendro tegu kumu, iso tele de uno-pe pote vide.

        Green tree(s) cover hill(s) as far as one   can  see.


   On the simple functioning of syntax, and on the sequencing of words within NOUN and VERB PHRASES, please check out Seminars #1 & #2, if you have not already done so.

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

Using particles is really equivalent to affixes. Glosa's basic grammar
is not a problem. There are other natural langs that work similarly.

Your "seminar" notes are very helpful.

You can visit Alexander's work, the translation of the first step of
"18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa" in Russian, on

   http://www.glosa.org/brevi/g18sr.htm .

(Certainly interesting for Non-Russians, too.  Glosa-pe can use it as
a first 'Step to Russian' as well.)

And you are not wrong to do so. ~U~ and ~plu~ can almost always
be translated by 'a/the' and 'some/the' in English. But there 'real'
function
is a noun phrase markers. And they don't show the definite/indefinite
distinction English speakers are used to.

My contention is that this distinction is redundant. This may be trying
to prove a negative, which, I believe, is impossible. So I've been
attempting to get someone to provide an example that proves the
hypothesis wrong and that shows the distinction is significant.

Thanks for your interesting examples.

Note: The word list definitions -
~U(n)~ = a, an, one, the, any
~Plu~ = more than one

>Plu ju-an pa trans u via. ( a number of boys; one road )
>But, where a numerator is used, it is fairly obvious that either U or PLU
are not needed.
>Tri ju-an trans bi via. ( 3 boys; 2 roads )

Agreed.

>BUT Plu tri ju-an; qi habita u proxi viki,
>[the 3 boys who live-in the nearby village]
>pa trans plu bi via; alelo na viki.
>[did cross the 2 roads (which are) beside our village]

>Did I use ~plu~ as a "determinant" in both of these cases, or was I simply
trans-scribing my English usage into Glosa?
>If there are only three boys in the next village, these are they.
>If there is a particular pair of roads running beside our village, then
these are the same two roads.

Great example.
~Plu tri ju-an~ [More-than-one three boys]
Here ~plu~ doesn't map to 'the'. The English
phrase is definite because you know how
many boys live there. If you wish to wish to
communicate this fact then why not say,

~Panto tri ju-an; qi eko in certa proxi viki~
[All three boys, who live in a particular nearby village]

>Real problems used to present themselves for me in Glosa, when I
specifically wanted to use
>the "a" [one of] function, and also when, in English, I would naturally say
"some" [an amount of].

Interesting. Robin thinks of ~u~ as primarily meaning 'the',
and Charles (in another posting ) thinks of ~u~ (and ~mo~) as
meaning 'a'.

>Nowadays, I use ~uno~ [= one of the] to specify an un-named singularity.
>EG Uno andra pa kine-auto to un antero de u grega.
>[a man did move himself to(position) the front of the group]
>A man stepped to the front of the group.

Here the man is 'indefinite' in English because
he hasn't been mentioned before. In the next
sentence he will be 'definite'.

"The group became silent to listen to
what the man had to say."

I think this is clear from the context.
If it was a different man who was
being listened to, it could just be
~hetero andro~ instead of ~un andro~ .

>And for years I thought there could be a Glosa word, like ~des~ [of the] to
translate the general usage of "some" in English. >But, in trying to fit in

>While in the kitchen, some women ate some of the cheese.

I would say that ~plura~ is more specific than 'some',
meaning 'a small number of', and that 'some' is just
~plu~ [more than one] in the first usage.

'Some of the cheese' = ~ex kasea~
'A piece of cheese' = ~mero kasea~
'All the cheese'= ~holo kasea~

~U mero de u kasea~.
This seems to me to be an unnecessarily close copy
of the English 'a piece of the cheese'. (Note: one ~u~
is 'a' and one is 'the'). ~Mero kasea~ seems sufficient
to me.

>Well, this sort of word game keeps me happy ... and it might be good Glosa
as well.

Good Glosa is Glosa that communicates the intended meaning.

Poli saluta,
Nick

Also, ~ex kasea~ sounds like something popping out of the
cheese--like a child of the cheese--which is not something
I want on my dinner table. 

My list has ~mero~ as meaning "portion". So I guess I would
tend to use ~mero~ to refer to some portion or fraction of
the cheese, and ~blocka~ to refer to a piece of chese.

So I might use ~mero de kasea~ (portion of cheese), and
~kasea bloka~ ("cheese block"). I think the "de" is
important here, if you're going to put the adjective
(cheese) after the noun (portion, block). Just a guess on
my part.

I'm ok with some level of ambiguity here. English itself is
pretty vague when you refer to "some" or "a piece" of
cheese. Those could be slivers or huge piles. If you want
to be more clear, add more words: ~mega~ ~pusi~ ~proxi
semi~ ~bi kilograma~ etc.

I would like to raise the possibilty that the use of the terms 
noun-phrase and verb-phrase, is importing English grammatical
categories into Glosa, where they only approximately fit.

Similarly Latin grammatical terms and patterns where artificially
applied during the beginings of the study of English grammar,
because that's what people were used to thinking about.

Consider: ~Mi grafo poesi~.
~Mi~ is the first word, so the start of something.
But is it 'I' or 'My' or somewhere in between?
~Grafo~ is 'write', so ' I write' or 'My writing'.
And here we have already assumed that the default
tense is the present tense. It is more natural to speak
or write about something that has already happened, 
rather than to commentate on what's going on in the 
present moment. So 'I wrote' or 'My past writing'.
Or is the writer omitting the tense marker to suggest
a timeless fact, 'It is my custom to write' or 'Something
that is, was and will be characteristic of me, is my writting'?
~Poesi~ is 'poetry', and so also 'poetically'.
'How' I write or 'what' I write or somewhere in between.

Note: ~Mi ge-grafo poesi~ 'My written poetry'
~Mi poesi grafo~ 'I do-poetry in the form of writting'
               i.e. not oral poetry.       
or 'My poetry writing' (Answer to the question 'What do you
like best about yourself?')

So, what conclusions follow.

Pronouns can mark the beginning of a noun-phrase-equivalent,
or indicate the next word is the beginning of the verb-phrase-equivalent.
But the pronoun can be preceded by a 'quantifier'. 
So ~panto na~ 'all of us', ~tetra mu~ 'four of them'.

All verb-phrase-equivalents can start with ~ne~.
But ~Ne mi.~ 'Not me' (Answer to the question 'Who likes cabbage?')
Affirmative verb-phrase-equivalents can begin with a 'time marker',
~nu~, ~fu~ or ~pa~.
But  ~pa di~ 'yesterday', ~fu anua~ 'next year', ~nu di~ 'nowadays'.
The 'aspect marker' ~du~ can begin an affirmative 
verb-phrase-equivalents, if no 'time marker' is being used and
the action is 'progressive or continuous'.
{Is ~du~ considered to be a different word from ~dura~?}
Affirmative conditional verb-phrase-equivalents begin with ~sio~.
{Is there any other known use of ~sio~?}
Verb-phrase-equivalents can begin with 'helper verb'.
'Helper verbs' can also be full verbs, or nouns or adjectives or adverbs.

~U~ and ~plu~ would show that start of the noun-phrase-equivalent.
      ~Mi grafo u poesi~ (the stuff) compared 
      with ~Mi grafo ko poesi~ (the manner).
And there is another set of words that can be included here but which 
may have other uses also, ~oligo~, ~hetero~, ~pluso~, ~certa~, 
~plura~, ~poli~, ~mega~, ~sati~, ~panto~, ~holo~, ~mero~, ~mikro~,
~uno~, ~ali~, ~singu~, ~pusi~, ~solo~, ~speci~, ~nuli~, ~qo~.
And the ~u~/~plu~ compound words, ~u-ci~, ~u-la~, ~plu~ci~, ~plu-la~.
But these can also be 'pronouns'.
Numerals, ~mo~, ~bi~, etc can start the noun-phrase-equivalent.
But ~u bibli penta~ 'the fifth book'.

Conclusion: Either this is a lot more complicated than expected or
we are looking at it from the wrong point of view.

Saluta,
Nick

This was an absolutely brilliant, insightful post. It has
given me a great deal to ponder.

> Conclusion: Either this is a lot more complicated than

Or both.

My first reaction is some combination like "looking at
Glosa through my language culture and biases, it looks very
complex" along with "Glosa seems to be able to transcend
our rigid word-parts in ways that are simple and
beautiful".

Unfortunately, I'm not sure I can get to that simple place
from where I am. It looks like it would take almost a
complete change in my way of thinking and communicating. So
for now, I'm stuck with the complexity.

Hmmmmm..

OK. On it's own, it does sound unappetising. :-)
How's it sound in context?

~Mero~ can be thought of as meaning 'a-part-of', and
act as 'quantifier'. Compare 'enough cheese', 
'too much cheese', 'a lot of cheese'.

To appeal to "context" is to admit you can't think of a way

No. Noun and verb phrases are absolute linguistic universals.

Not "we". A study of linguistics would help dispel confusion.
Definiteness is always expressible in a language. Articles are
just one way to do it. Context alone does not suffice.

'Absolute' universals are very few and far between in linguistics.
For example - 'All languages have vowels'.

Noun and verb phrases are so called because the head of the
phrase is a noun or a verb. That raises the question as to what
is a noun or a verb. Harder to answer than might be thought.

It could be said that a noun is the name of something. But
is beauty a 'thing'? Isn't the adjective 'red' also the name
of a colour?

So definitions based on meaning have been replaced by
definitions based on structural features, that signal the 
way in which classes of words behave in a language.

Glosa's lack of inflexions and use of words in multiple
grammatical word classes, make this determination of
the class of the head word less than obvious, and allow
the possibility that Glosa can have phrases that are not
definitely noun or verb phrases.

Nick

Currently, my word list has:

du: continue, continuous, continuing
dura: durable, lasting, tough, durable, endure, permanent,
last (v)

I am increasingly feeling like having a verb marking word
may be a good idea, but I sure haven't figured out what
that word should be.

This morning I was thinking about ~ti~ (shortened from
~akti~).

No. Glosa uses pre-positioned particles instead of inflections.
They serve identically the same purpose.

Only in your fantasies. I retract the advice I gave you

    Except that noun-phrase and verb-phrase structures, by whatever
names and whatever structures, seem to be pretty much linguistic
universals.  To be sure, in some languages (such as English to some
extent) a given word may serve as a noun or verb in different contexts,
but regardless those languages still have noun phrases and verb phrases.

After speaking/writing a few such sentences, you will certainly
drop it in favor of appropriate tense particles and auxiliaries.

I see no problem with the verbs as long as those aren't elided.
There is a similar problem with some people attempting to
forego any sign of the noun phrase -- it doesn't work.

Glosa is not unique. It is a sort of English-Chinese-Euro pidgin.
Pidgins/creoles have a known structure. This isn't quite like Lojban,
an unconstrained toy/experiment. It has to follow basic linguistic
principles and be a real human language.

Conlangers are free to go elsewhere (as I sometimes do myself)
and indulge their imaginations. Glosa is supposed to be serious.

After writing fairly extensively in Glosa, I'm still using
~du~. In fact, I'm using it more now than when I started.

I agree. A real _workable_, _usable_ language. I have tried
to write quite a bit of original material and especially
translated material in Glosa. I don't think anyone can
judge  how effective Glosa is (or is not) unless/until they
have done so.

And that's where I'm stumbling at the moment. Glosa seems
to be a bit too complex (or ambiguous, at the writer's
discretion) if you follow conventional rules and thought
patterns. 

Nick seems to be pointing out that Glosa may be suited to
thinking about such things in a different way, and at the
moment, I'm inclined to agree. 

Now whether Glosa can still be used effectively with a
conventional mindset is another question. And whether a new
mindset suited to Glosa is possible or desirable is yet
another question.

For now, I am certainly open to the possibiliy that Glosa
may currently be structured in a way that allows for (or
encourages?) phrases to be neither clearly noun-phrase, nor
clearly verb-phrase. 

Perhaps they must always be more one than the other. Or
perhaps there are ambiguities in the language that should
be "fixed". Or perhaps there are desireable ambiguities.
Or...?

I am not a linguist. I am enjoying learning about languages
and how they affect (and are affected by) our thought
patterns. I am mostly interested in finding, and using, a
simple and effective IAL, whether it follows universal
rules or breaks them.

Kevin

Whelp, after about a year or so of lurking on this list, snorting at
obvious absurdities and inanities, this post finally convinced me to
unsubscribe once and for all.  Glosa will fail the reason Esperanto
failed: because those involved with it are often pricks.

Well, perhaps, I could put it another way.

~Mi grafo poesi~ can be analysed in 4 ways.

1. ~Grafo~ is VP and ~poesi~ is direct object NP.
2. ~Grafo~ is VP and ~poesi~ is adverb.
3. ~Grafo poesi~ is a compound VP, on the ~dice qestio~ [to ask] &
                 ~lose bio~ [to die] model.
4. ~Mi grafo poesi~ is NP and therefore a 'minor sentence' meaning
                 [My writing poetry (is an event that exists).]

My secondary point was that the omission of the 'time marker' 
could be intended to indicate that the 'event' is 'timeless' and
that it is, was and will be a characteristic of the speaker's
behaviour.

My tertiary point being that the ambiguity could be intentional,
but that Glosa has structures that can remove the ambiguity if
it is not intentional.

Saluta,
Nick

CCC> Definiteness is always expressible in a language. Articles are

Still, Russian does not use articles. And I couldn't say that Russian
is less precise than English, in general.

One example has come to my mind. It is concerned with general
obligidary grammar features, rather than definiteness itself.

In Russian, verbs in past tense are inflected on gender. Thus, when I
hear a sentence 'Ya shla domoy' (= 'I went home'), I know, that the
speaker is a woman ('shla' is feminine singular past form). The phrase
'Ya shyol domoy' means the same ('I went home'), but says us that the
speaker is male. I doubt that such information can be expressed in
English in some normal form (that is, in a form which can be found in
real speach). Does this mean that English is a defective, non-complete
language?

On the other hand, in English, nouns (or, precisely, noun phrases),
have obligidary definiteness markers, which are absent in Russian. And
the differences betweeen 'Washington is a capital' and 'Washington is
the capital' dissappear in Russian translation...

Sorry, if you cannot catch what I mean. I couldn't express my thoughts
more clear :(((

I believe that all natural languages can (and must) express
all the same things. Over time, they all have converged to a
similar level of expressiveness balanced with difficulty.
(But an artificial language can be designed to be easier
to learn by adults as a second language.) I'm sure Russian
has ways to express definiteness without articles, just as
English can express gender without inflections, and like
Chinese expresses number without our style of plurals.

I guess that Russian would use "one" or "some" to indicate
indefiniteness when necessary?

Many of the English uses for articles can be elided without problems.
My example illustrated the difference between "X is one of the Y"
and "X is the only Y", which must be easy to express in any language.

Perhaps, you are right, and I just don't see those ways.
Of course, we have construction like 'That very X, who ...'. But in
other cases we normally don't use any words to express
definiteness/indefiniteness.
I would like to study this question. I suggest that you give me a
number of sentences, in which definiteness is very significant. And I
will tell you how they are translated in Russian...

We can say 'somebody', but it's third person. In 1st and 2nd persons
gender specification is obligidary and cannot be skipped.

CCC> Many of the English uses for articles can be elided without problems.

In Russian these two sentences would be normally translated the same
way. Say, 'George Bush is a President' is just 'George Bush -
President' (copula is omitted in usual speach). 'George Bush is the
President of the United States' is 'George Bush - prezident
Soyedinennyh Shtatov' (look at the absence of any determinator before
'Soyedinennyh Shtatov' = 'the United States').

Thanks. I had problems not only with my English, but with putting my

Charles pointed out that inflexions have been replaced 
by pre-positioned particles in Glosa. Whilst these are
more likely to be omitted, than are inflexions, in texts, 
they do give a route to a definition of word class based 
on a word's relationship to them.

For example one could start to define 'nouns' as any word that
occurs as a head word in a phrase beginning ~u~ or ~plu~.

~u mega tabla~ [table]
~u bibli tri~       [book]
~plu poda de u zoa~   [leg] [animal] etc

But then one might meet with

~u vora~     [meal/eating]
~u kanta~   [song/singing]  etc

Are these words in the same word class?
Would one need to restrict the 'noun' class to words that
*don't* occur as head words in phrases being ~du~?

How about ~U ju-an du pa nasa u kuko.~?

What class would ~nasa~ be? Is true to say it's a noun 
being used as a verb? Or should be there be a separate 
class of words that can do this? Are the following
sentences correct?

~U nasa de flori es gluko.~    [smelling a flower is nice]
~U nasa de andro es rubi.~    [the man's nose is red]

Poli ami saluta,
Nick

PS I've now been reminded that ~plu~ occurs after 
the possessive pronoun in standard Glosa texts, so it is not 
always guaranteed to be the start of a noun-phrase-equivalent.
Exempla - ~mi plu bibli~ [my books]

ISTM that there are only two word classes in True Glosa,
particles and the content words. This corresponds to the
Chinese distinction between "empty" and "full" words.
Similar to linguistic terminology that categorizes words
by degree of "semantic bleaching", i.e. particles are
words that have had most of their meaning bleached out
so they can perform syntactic/grammatical functions.

What makes VORA a "verb" is placing it in a verb phrase.
In a noun phrase it becomes a noun. The terms "noun" and
"verb" are dispensible in teaching Glosa, which always
seems to please grammar-hating students. Just show them
a few sentence patterns, and they get the idea. Anyway,
that was the design goal of the authors.

So, rather than sub-classing the concept words, we should
be looking at the noun-forming and verb-forming particles
and arranging them into a neat table or list of lists.

As Charles pointed out (more or less), a Glosa word may be
a 'noun' in one sentence, and a 'verb' in another. Words
represent concepts, and may be used as verbs, nouns,
adjectives, or adverbs, as long as the meaning makes sense.

This is a fair question, so I must take a swing at it:
Imagine we are walking around the lake, you and me (both male)
and Jan (a female), when suddenly we encounter a pack of coyotes.
We agree to use the word "KANI" for "coyotes". Usually I just
chase them away, but tonight we will practice Glosa instead.

Jan:  "Plu mega kani!"
C:    Yes, I think the plural marker should precede the adjective.
P:    Why waste time with articles? Reduplication is better here.
Jan:  "Kani! Kani! ... Mega kaniiiiiiiii!"
Kani: "Boni gusta, u gina."
N:    See, context is sufficient! But ambiguous too! Cool!
Kani: But I want to specify whether any or just this one is "boni".
M:    No problem. We can eliminate article "u" 3 lines above.
C:    "Boni gusta, gina" sounds like a command to the victim.
Syd:  We can use a preposition to separate it from the verb.
Jan:  You mean like "Boni gusta de gina"? That's descriptive ...
Kani: No. I definitely meant "Gina pa gusta boni ad mi".
C:    We need to try a less treacherous verb than "gusta".
Jan:  "Bate kani."
P:    There, that's perfect! No extraneous particles.
C:    Which one? "U maxi mega kani? Fe kani? Tri kani?"
N:    All of them, "Panto!"
Jan:  Excessive, I love my pet dog at home. "Bate justi kani-co."
C:    That's cheating, Glosa has no morphology.

Sorry. That's what happens every time I try to write in Glosa.
I think there are many different cases where we need specific
"determiners", and I'd prefer a strictly defined closed set
of them, clearly described with examples of each. But it's
not so easy to do that.

Well, any language has indicative particle... That's the way both
Russian and English do. In English I'd say 'this woman' (without
article).
In Glosa we can say 'u-ci gina', can't we?

I don't argue that a language needs a way to specify definiteness. But
I think this can be voluntary, used only when it's needed.  And in
most cases some more specific words could play their (articles') role
better.
If I understand you correctly, you insist on using articles
'English-like' way, as obligatory part of a noun phrase... I think,
this is redundant...

But I see a problem here, in words representing just concepts, without
determining them as basically 'nouns' or 'verbs'. Because nouns and
verbs are different mental entities, and mixing them is a kind of
trick, IMHO...
Let's take Nikc's example:
NH> ~u vora~     [meal/eating]
The basic meaning of the concept is 'eating', 'to eat' (act). When
using it as a noun, it should be naturaly mean 'the act/process of
eating'. But in one text about Glosa (can't recall which) I've met the
sentence 'Mi vora u vora', where 'u vora' mean 'food' (object of
eating), not the act. I beleave that 'eating' and 'food' are
_different_ concepts, and my intrinsic feeling of language says me
that they belong to different classes...

The things are even more complex, when we take words, which are
'basically nouns'. If we start from 'food' = (say) 'sito'. Is it a
noun or verb? Whan does the phrase 'Mi du sito' mean??? Does it mean
'I am cooking' or 'I am eaing', or 'I am feeding (somebody)? Or 'I am
being a piece of food'? :)))

Another example, which comes to my mind, is 'manu' = 'hand'. What
should it mean when used as a verb? The dictionary interprets it as
'hand over, pass, manage'. Why not 'to beat'? Or 'to gesticulate'?

I mean that for many (most?) words which are 'basically nouns', there
is no 'normal' way of interpreting them as verbs.

Yes, and I think U-CI is probably the best answer for this.
Or maybe use just "CI GINA" if number is not relevant?

Yes, I agree, I like non-mandatory particles for all these things.
When any one of them appears, it marks the beginning of a noun phrase.
Otherwise prepositions can do that job. Actually, the only problem is
the accusative, because all other cases are marked by prepositions,
and we can use "de" (or "em" or something else) for that.
But I still think Glosa needs better definiteness particles.

Well, I prefer case markers myself. But this contradicts one of the
main Glosa's principle (relying on strict word order in a sentence).
If a reform of Glosa would be done, I would definitely vote for
case/slot markers :) They could play role of default
noun-phrase-markers, by the way.
Say, we use 'sa' and 'em' as subject and object markers respectively
(words are selected for an example only):

Sa mi nu vide em ci gina = Em ci gina sa mi nu vide = ... etc

Isn't this nice? As a russian, I like it :))))

P.S. I don't think that such a reform if _necessary_, anyway. As a
software developer, I know that there is a moment when we must freeze
the project and stop chaotical 'improvements' ...
P.P.S. But personally for me, some changes would definitely improve
Glosa :)

From: Mikhail Adigeyev <madigeyev{at}yandex{dot}ru>
Date: Tue, 6 Nov 2001 12:55:15 +0300

Saluta, Glosa-pe!

I've almost finished my translating short info about Glosa into
Russian. I have one problem and would like to consult with y'all.

What is the precise difference in meaning between

It got broken. = Id pa gene frakti.

and

It is broken. = Id es ge-frakti.

?

BTW, I found some othe features which look odd for me.
Is Glosa's 'gene' a complete equivalent of English 'get'? For me
merging both 'to become' and 'to obtain' in one word is rather
illogical... For Russian student it would be rather difficult to
understand why phrases 'Id gene frakti' and 'Mi gene u feli' use the
same verb...

Some other features came to Glosa directly from English, I belive.
Say, in Russian weeks is suuposed to start from Monday, so calling
Mondi 'di-bi' (second day) is rather odd... (Though I dont know how it
can be fixed. Perhaps, using names for days of week would be more
convenient).

Another strange thing is 'Nona minuta po tri horo'. I think, that
Russian-style construction '3 horo 9 minuta' is more logical (we dont
call 6th of November '6 days post October' :))))

I'll try. It will be interesting to hear other ideas.

For me, "it got broken" means that there was an action
sometime in the past that caused it to move from a
non-broken state to a broken state. "It is broken" merely
says that is is currently in a broken state, with no
indication of how. It might have been built broken, or just
deteriorated over time.

I agree. This is one of many places where Glosa has
inherited English idioms (or at least English thought
patterns). I don't know if it's worth changing, but it's
worth considering.

Since ge- is so commonly used, if it were to change I would
hope that gene would have to retain its "become" meaning,
and lose its "obtain" meaning. But we don't really have an
alternative already in the language.

On the other hand, we have the basic word ~esce~ which does
mean become, so ~gene~ could mean obtain, ~esce~ could be
become, and we could keep ~ge-~ as a legacy word no longer
directly derived from gene.

This is a common problem in IAL's. Some start with Sunday,
others with Monday, and others use names (usually
Romance-derived). None of the solutions are great. Although
I prefer Monday = 1, I wouldn't change Glosa at this point.

English allows either form.

Very interesting comments. Thanks!

Saluta,

I've met a number of mentions about Hogben's Interglossa. As far as I
could understand, it had many interesting features, some of which are
similar to those of my own toy conlang.

Are there any online resources available, which contain wider info
about Interglossa's grammar?

No contradiction, the order within a noun phrase is fixed:
case (ad, de, etc), possessives (mi, tu, etc), deictic (ci, co, etc),
number (u, plu, etc), gender (an, fe, etc), other adjectives, noun,
and then those horrible suffixes (-bo, -pe, etc).

We have a "subject" (really "agentive" or "ergative" or "ablative"): PER.
And for accusative object, either add EM or just use DE. This is
not really reform, just re-analysis.

If it isn't broken, don't fix it. Glosa is broken in a several places.
But its syntax is workable. Just adding a few missing particles would be
a very minor "reform". Fixing the main vocabulary, though, that is major.

It did become broken.  <---- dynamic event

It stays in a state of breakage.  <---- static state

Good point. So use two different (auxiliary) verbs.
But actually Glosa has both GE and GENE for English GET ...
GE is auxiliary "become", but GENE seems more like "obtain".

Mi pa gene tri feli. (obtain)
Id (pa) ge frakti. (become)
Id es (ge) frakti. (state)

You didn't ask the harder question about "fall" vs. "drop".

Saluta, Charles,


CCC> We have a "subject" (really "agentive" or "ergative" or "ablative"): PER.
For me, PER corresponds to _instrumental_ case. If we use it to mark
nominative, we wouldn't say sentences like 'Mi bate u kuni per mi
manu'...
Also, Glosa is based on nominative/accusative case system, rather than
ergative/absolutive. Am I wrong? I don't think we could use PER to
mark subject in intransitive sentences ('Mi ki a loka')...

Rick Harrison scanned in several pages, but just checking at
his web pages I couldn't find them anymore. You might write
to him and ask. I found it all very disappointing in detail.
But the basic idea of English-Chinese word order is still good.

You should also look into the Lingua Franca, a real pidgin
that served Europe for over 800 years; it has nearly the
same design.

Hogben's biggest mistake was using Greek vocab, I think.

Please send it, when ready.  I am looking forward to it.  It would be
great, if you could put it directly into my HTML-code

Sunday as first day is Jewish and Christian tradition.  On the other
hand, the word "weekend" implicates Monday as number one.  In Germany
both ways of counting are in use.  I think, Sun=1 is acceptable.

    I have never been aware of much actual material online abut
Interglossa other than references.  Somewhere, if my memory serves
correctly, I read that the late Ron Clark actually acquired the
copyright to the book "Interglossa."  Occasionally used copies are
available from used book dealers.  I located one through the Advanced
Book Exchange, which is a valuable resources for finding used books in
English: http://www.abebooks.com .  There may also be another resource
at http://www.bibliofind.com , although I have never used it.

    Opinions vary about Interglossa.  Having looked at it, in some ways
I like it better than Glosa.  Charles has expressed his opinion that
Hogben's use of a predominantly Greek vocabulary was a mistake.  I
simply disagree, and neither of us is likely to convince the other. 
Interglossa came out during World War II and never really got a good
trial.  Sorry, I would say, although I doubt that Interglossa is likely
to get much of a trial at this late date.

I think of it as an unfinished project; Ron+Wendy did a fair job
of revising it, but it still remains incomplete and should be
majorly revised one more time. As far as vocabulary source,
certainly Greek is the braver and more interesting choice,
but Ron decided to include Latin as well. I'd prefer it to
draw from either Greek or Latin, but not both.

Yes. This is copying the English usage. 'I eat a meal'. While a meal
is an act-of-eating, you can't really eat the act. There is a tendency
in natural languages for the names for actions (-tion words in English)
to become 'concrete' nouns, for example, publication, the act of
publishing, becomes, the thing published, a magazine,etc.

In Glosa, the action can be made concrete by using an appropriate
'generic', for example, ~vora-ma~.

Primarily 'to feed (somebody)'.
But it's back to looking at the context again here. Or being more explicit
~Mi du dona sito (a pe)~  [I'm feeding (somebody)]
~Mi du gene sito~ [I'm eating]
~Mi du prepara sito~ [I'm cooking]

The verb is basicly ~akti per manu~, and so allowing lots of possible
meanings, and also implicitly saying that the 'noun' meaning is the primary
one. ~Manu~ = 'to manage' seems to have got in there on etymological
grounds, and I would not want to keep this meaning. ~Kontrola~ seems
better for 'to manage'

> I mean that for many (most?) words which are 'basically nouns', there

There are some general interpretations
1) to use as a tool  ~akti per~
        hammer/to hammer         ~malea~
        telephone/to telephone    ~telefono~
2) to use a means of transport  ~ki per~
        train/to go by train           ~trena~
        car/to drive (go by car)   ~vagona~
2) to provide with  ~dona~
         frame/to frame (a picture)  ~qadra~
         colour/to paint                   ~kroma~


An early Glosa word list (1984) divides 'content' words into
'Things' (box,cake,fish,page,star,owe,death,victory, etc) and
'Concepts' (buy,flood,plough,sweat,funny,busy,green,too,sleep, etc),
with 'concepts' being usable as nouns, verbs and adjectives. Not
sure that is helpful. Perhaps that's why it was abandoned!

~Gene~ is 'get' in the passive sense of receiving something.

~Mi pa gene u grama~ 
I got a letter. I received a letter. A letter was delivered to me.

~Mi pa gene frigo~
I got cold. I received coldness. Coldness was given to me.
I became cold.

~Mi poda pa gene frakti~
My leg got broken. My leg received an act of breaking.
My leg was the object of an act of breaking.
An act of breaking was applied to my leg.

Note: ~frakti~ = 'breaking' and ~ge-frakti~ = 'broken'

Actually, Hogben also used both Greek and Latin words in
Interglossa, extracting them from the elements that make 
up the scientific terminology.

Glosa's vocabulary is very similar to Interglossa. Ron and 
Wendy put in some shorter words as replacements for
some of Hogben's choices, for example, 'postula' (still in 
Glosa 1000) was replaced by 'si' as word for 'if'. Hogben 
thought that longer words give more time to think, and lead 
to better expression of one's ideas and less semantic change.

Saluta,
Nick

Well, I'm not so interested in vocabulary. One thing that interested
me was the concept of 'light' verbs (I'm not sure about the term).
When I myself was pondering about a logical language construction,
I've come to similar concept. So I'd like to know more about Hogben's
construction...

Thanks for explanations.

NH> ~Mi du dona sito (a pe)~  [I'm feeding (somebody)]
NH> ~Mi du gene sito~ [I'm eating]

If so, I think it's better to treat 'sito' as a noun, and use the
above constructions to make a verb. Using just 'du sito' can lead to
confusing...

I'd unite the former two into one class - 'to use'
The last would include also cases like 'to turn into'.
I see one more variant - 'to be/become'...

Since there several ways of interpreting a noun as a verb, I'd prefer
use special 'light' or auxilary verb to 'verbify' (is it a term?) a
noun...

The most common pattern in language is to use topic-comment order
and a nominative alignment, so Glosa might as well do it that way.
What we usually call "subject" may be either the doer or receiver
of an action, and comes first in the sentence, and has no zero
case marking (i.e. no "preposition"). So the only way to indicate
a difference logically is to mark the verb as "active" vs. "passive".

The dog bites.   The man is bitten.
Kani morda.      Andro ge morda.

The dog bites the man.   The man is bitten by the dog.
Kani morda (de) andro.   Andro ge morda per kani.

For transitive sentences the "object" follows the verb and is
zero-marked for accusative, else has a preposition to show case.
This shows "agentive instrumental" is equivalent to "ergative".
And if an accusative marker is wanted, "de" works nicely.
Glosa's nominative and accusative are both normally zero-marked,
consistent with its tendency to elide particles when possible,
but they are available when necessary.

That was the nose of the camel under the tent.

It used to be popular to appeal to "international scientific
vocabulary" but with today's poor educational system, that
fashion has receded. There aren't enough elements among the
"scientific combining forms" to make an IAL.

Yes, he had a lot of silly ideas like that. As I said, Ron
and Wendy improved it greatly, but it needs a version 3.

I agree. Light verbs are the best way to design an IAL.
It minimizes the number of lexical items to be learned and
gives the users maximum leverage and power. It is possible
to analyze any English verb into a light verb construction.
I've posted several relevant URLs before ...

The truly important word classes are not the classic Latin ones,
but more like these:

head word (the bulk of the vocabulary)
particle (implementers of syntax)

Particles should be subclassed, like:

tense/aspect/mood: pa, du, ...
auxiliary verbs: es, ge, pote, ...
light verbs: face, moti, ...
(etc)

case prepositions: de, ad, per, ...
determiners: mi, u, u-la, ...
numbers: mo, panto, nuli, ...
(etc)

Ideally, all the particles can be arranged in a neat table
that displays their proper syntactic order and automatically
guides a learner in constructing sentences. I made one in
HTML with pull-down boxes once, then tried to sub-class
the main vocabulary items too, which would make a sort of
online interactive dictionary. Too much work ...

Glosa uses ~per~ to mark the instrument and ~ex~ to mark the agent
in the case of a passive participle .

~U drama ge-grafo ex William Shakespeare~ [A play written by William
Shakespeare]

These are what Hogben termed 'verboids'. They remain a feature of
Glosa, although, as one doesn't have to appear in very clause as it did
in Interglossa, they are less noticeable.

Quoting from "Central Glosa"

20 VERBIODS

These are 20 very interesting verbs, because, amazingly they play a
part in the action of all the many thousands of other verbs. They
are very useful as they will provide precision when there is a possibility
of mis-understanding.

AKTI             act, do, perform
AKUSTI        hear, listen
APO              remove
BALI             throw, send
DONA          give
DETEKTI      find
DICE             say, speak tell
EQA              be a member of
ESTE             feel
FACE            make, build, construct
GENE            get, receive, acquire
HABE            have, possess
KI                  go, move itself
LOSE            lose

Karo, Glosa-pe!

Few days ago I've finished my translarion of brief info about glosa
into Russian and have sent the text to Marcel Springer.
Marcel detected traces of virus in the page I've sent him. I've
checked my computer with an antivirus software, but no virus was
found.
Since I've just edited english variant of the page that I've
downloaded from www.glosa.org, my guess is that the server might be
infected. Marcel cured the file I've sent him, so
http://www.glosa.org/brevi/ruski.htm is free from viruses now.

But Marcel has no time to check other pages in the site. So he asked
me to warn all of you that there is a possibility that Glosa site i
infected. He can check the site in 7 days only, not earlier.

    However, since your first language, kevin, is English, this reasoning
can't be relevant.  I suspect that you have found a mental pathway which
suits you, and find it apt.
    But the spirit of the language is the avoidance of unnecessary words,
and in the case of the SIMPLE PRESENT tense, the bare word being used as a
verb is the clean form of the language.
         ~Mi ki ad u boteka.~      SIMPLE PRESENT
         ~Mi du ki ad u boteka.~   PRESENT CONTINUOUS

    Also, between these two forms, I feel there is a functional semantic
difference, EG
         ~Singu di-mo, mi ki ad u boteka.~    ETERNAL PRESENT
         ~Mi ki ad u boteka, kron id habe aperi.~  "     "
         [ ................  when it is open]
     cf  ~Mi fu ki ad u boteka, tem id aperi.~   SIMPLE FUTURE
         [ ................     when it opens] 

         ~Mi age u vagona longi u via, e mi du ki ad u boteka.~
     OR
         ~Mi du age u vagona longi u via, e mi ki ad u boteka.~
     BUT NOT NECESSARILY
         ~Mi du age u vagona longi u via, e mi du ki ad u boteka.~
     NOR
         ~Mi age u vagona longi u via, e mi ki ad u boteka.~

   While I have no idea what the Linguists call this sort of intuitive use
of language, but I simply call it FEEL.

*   Well, if written badly, or hastily, Glosa can be more than ambiguous;
however, the intention of the authors was that the language, when used
well, is quite specific, and capable of only one interpretation - where
that was the writer's intention.

*   The difference is a form of standardisation; thus Glosa is supposed to
use a sort of "universalised" syntax.  EG   to have , or to be.
       In French,   "L'eau habe froid."      =HAS (THE PROPERTY OF)
       In English,  "The water is cold."     =IS

    I believe that the French usage is the universalised form, and was
convinced of this by Ron Clark.

       In Glosa,   ~U hidra habe frigo.~  =HAS THE PROPERTY OF COLDNESS    

>Now whether Glosa can still be used effectively with a

>
*   Yes, these are three good questions.
   1. Conventional Mindset: I suspect that such a mind is set in the
conventions of its First Language; if people translate their national
idioms, metaphors, and natlang idiosyncratic syntax into Glosa, they are
likely to write Glosa which is hard to read for people from other
linguistic traditions.
   2. New mindset suited to Glosa: yes!  When you learn a new natlang, you
must try to get into the style of thinking of the native speakers of that
language.  This is also true of an auxlang, but it is a bit harder, because
there is no existing auxlang culture (of course the Espirantists would say
that one does exist), and an auxlang is supposed to be suitable for people
from all cultures to be able to wrap their minds around.  When a person can
confidently "think in Glosa" they have acquired the mindset suited to Glosa.
   3. A new minset suitable or possible: maybe not; possibly the world is
not ready for a concept-based language that uses raw syntax, without
morphological grammar .. now, or will be never ready .. ever.
      And maybe the hard-wired linguistic pathways that have evolved in the
human brain are not designed to express such 'raw thought.'
      However, when we put our mind to something, and if the gain is worth
it, we can step up to a higher level of mental functioning.  I'd say that
when people learn computer programming, they move up a gear, or two,
mentally.  And, using Glosa is a bit different from using natlangs, but not
as removed as computer programming.
   
>For now, I am certainly open to the possibiliy that Glosa
>may currently be structured in a way that allows for (or

*   I'd say "essential" is the right word.  The secret of a language with
'syntax-based grammar' is that the ancient trick of "parsing and analysis"
has to work, and the clause and phrase structures need to be clearly
definable.
    However, Glosa has pretentions of being an auxiliary language, so, as
well as being universalised and standardised, it needs also to be
natural(istic) too.

>Perhaps they must always be more one than the other. Or
>perhaps there are ambiguities in the language that should

*   While ambiguity is the lifeblood of language, and Glosa can do it as
                 well as any other language, it was proposed primarily a
standardised language for science; thus metphor and idiom should be avoided.

*  And I will agree, Glosa is worthy subject of such study: much of the
problem is that Linguists are having trouble deciding what are the
'universals', or if there are any; and then, when they do come up with a
finding, it is often expressed in a language unintelligible to the common man.

*   Ho Patrick, 
    If you havn't already gone, I would like to know if you tried
expressing yourself in Glosa .. or have spent time reading it?

    While I will agree that most people's idea of the function of a mailing
list is to facilitate discussion, I originally set up this List with the
hope that it would stimulate actual writing in Glosa.

    Perhaps the clue to your displeasure is captured in the Latin, but I
will have to have this translated to learn what message you might have for us.

Saluta, 

Robin

My acid test is whether I can read what I've written. The
sentences I've written without ~du~ tend to be very
difficult for me to parse. In my mind, as I'm writing it,
it's obvious. But even two minutes later when I re-read it,
I often stumble.

~Mi~ means both 'I' and 'my', so that next word (e.g.
~hedo~ could be a noun, an adjective, an adverb, or a verb.
I don't want to have to read the whole sentence to figure
out what that second word is. 

If there are certain words which we choose to say CANNOT be
used as anything other than a verb, then I would omit ~du~
before them. Perhaps ~ki~ is an example. But that means we
cannot say: ~mi du ge-turba per tu ki~ [I am bothered by
your movement(s)]. 

This would set up exceptions in the language, which may be
helpful and necessary, but which would add complexity for
people learning it.

I agree there is a difference, so perhaps we need a true
verb marker. On the other hand, we accept that Glosa does
not distinguish between 'a' and 'the', so why should it
distinguish between simple present and present continuous?
(This question is serious, because I don't really know
enough about language issues to know the answer).

The writing I have done is to translate my essays (mostly
related to software development), and to write notes to
this list. No fairy tales for me (yet).

I've done more translating to Glosa than writing in Glosa,
but have created at least a hundred original Glosa
sentences (probably quite a bit more). After I write in
Glosa, I usually translate that material to English as
well. 

In most cases I can roughly translate in either direction,
but there are definitely times when retelling is required.

This sounds like a request to translate Patrick's message
into 
some non-idiomatic form. I took it as something like:

~Mi pa skope u e-lista tem proxi mo anua. Mi pa ridi a plu

The first is not clear, because it can mean "my going to the store"
as well as "I go to the store". That's assuming "KI = to go".

I'd prefer to see KI as an auxiliary or light verb, and KINE as the
full concept word for "going" (and FU as redundant and ugly).

The use of pronouns like MI as possessive also is leading to
a lot of syntactic confusion.

That is what must always happen with any IAL.

The design of the IAL must allow for easy translation in both directions.
Simple translation is 95% relexing. The best IAL does not try to force
people to think in a different way, it aims for transparency.

A clear definition of 200 or so particles should be all that is
necessary to learn at the outset, then all the rest is just
filling in the vocabulary of concept words as needed.

    And the clean form of the language, in the avoidance of unnecessary
words, is to omit 'u' after 'ad' in these two instances, as 'ad' must
be followed by a noun structure.  Therefore, 'u' as a noun marker is
superfluous.

This seems to be almost exactly opposite of the GID
meanings. 

GID:
ne     omit
no-    (opposite formed)

My own interpretation is that "ne-" is the lack of
something, and "no-" is the opposite, so:

ne-amo    don't like
no-amo    hate

ne-kali      not pretty
no-kali      ugly

Mi pluso pa pute; 'da' fu pote indika; proto akti-verba
frase. Alo, mi pluso amo alo 'ta', 'i', alo 'to'. Qo-ra,
hetero Glosa-pe du amo?

Exempla:
Mi sibi tako lekto
Mi sibi du tako lekto
Mi sibi da tako lekto
Mi sibi ta tako lekto
Mi sibi to tako lekto
Mi sibi i tako lekto

I also thought that ~da~ could indicate the start of a verb
phrase. Or I also like either ~ta~, ~to~, or ~i~. Which do
other Glosa speakers like?

Example:
My sibling(s) read(s) fast
My sibling(s) is a(are) fast reader(s)

> pluso il es plu de dubito per plu de pe de "u-mi"/"u mi",

Qe, tu du sugesti; na pan-tem uti 'de mi' pro ~my/mine~? Mi
ne volu koerce u-la forma. Deskribe-verba poli kron loka
pre u cef verba in Glosa.

Are you suggesting that we always use ~de mi~ to mean
'my/mine'? I don't want to enforce that form. Adjectives
and adverbs usually go before the main word in Glosa.

Kevin

>From GID:

fatuo 1++        absurd; foolish; silly
stulti ++        fool; foolish
stupidi 1++      absurd; ridiculous; ruffian; stupid

I think ~no-intelige~ covers 'stupid'. 

I want to choose a single Glosa word to mean 'absurd,
foolish, silly, ridiculous', but I'm not sure which of
these would be best. I couldn't find any Greek roots for
them, and none seem to conflict with other Glosa words.

~fatuo~ has the ~uo~ that might be hard for some people to
pronounce? Perhaps it could evolve to ~fatu~, but that
sounds close to infatuation, which is almost an opposite
meaning.

~stulti~ is a bit hard for me to pronounce, but otherwise
seems fine. I can't think of a related English word, so I
couldn't look up the roots of this word. It seems to be a
spanish word, but I don't know if it came from Latin,
Greek, or elsewhere.

~stupidi~ is awfully close to the English 'stupid', so it's
probably not the best choice for 'foolish'.

I guess I'll go with ~stulti~, but would like feedback.

Also, 'ruffian' doesn't seem to belong on that list, since
it means 'bully', or someone who is mean or coerces others.
I'll probably just leave 'ruffian' off my list, and let
people build a word that conveys what they mean, such as:
~no-ami~, ~anti-pe~, ~koerce-pe~, etc.

Perhaps:

There are alternatives, of course:
Mi pa kausa ge-nati u babi. (?)
Mi fu fero u grega a sporta.
Mu du face u ciklo peri agrio zoa.

I like ~ze~ instead of ~ne~, but ~ze~ is only in GID basic
as a suffix, so it would sort of be adding a word, which I
have so far avoided. I guess the other existing option
would be ~nuli~:
  ~nuli-boni/nuli-mali~ = indifferent
  ~no-boni~ = bad
But I like ~ze~ much better. But then, if someone asks you
a yes/no question, would you answer ~ja/ne~, ~ja/no~, or
~ja/ze~?

Unfortunately, I discovered that ~anti~ can't mean both
'oppose' and 'opposite', as they are quite different:

~anti-pe~ = opposing-person (opponent)
~anti-pe~ = opposite-of-person (?)

~anti-face~ = opposing-construction
~anti-face~ = opposite-of-construction (destruction)

> words using "-", how about compound phrases with "_"

Ugh. I don't like them in computer programming, and I would
really dislike them in a human language.

Doesn't this mean "An old woman was a mother of the youth, who lost in
the city"? In that case it's an example of what I meant be 'to be'.

My knowledge of Glosa is not enough yet. There some cases in Russian,
where a noun-derived verb (derivation was made with standard suffix
for verb derivation) means 'to become' (e.g. 'zverj' -> 'zveretj').
In English I could find 'ice' (verb: to turn to ice)...

Theoretically it can. But I cannot create an example of a realistic

I'd say "An old woman 'mothered' a boy (acted like a mother to), 
             who was lost in the city".

And "The old woman was the mother of the youth."

Yes. That makes sense, but Glosa doesn't seem to do this. 
~Geli~  freeze, ~glacia~ ice.

That's because people don't actually talk or write in isolated
unrealistic sentences. I think the best/easiest thing is to translate
usenet postings in the colloquial way of writing/speaking.

> Perhaps, context always excludes all wrong interpretations?

I wish that were true but it isn't ... A real and useful
auxiliary language must be able to meet a higher standard,
Glosa cannot claim to have any special exemptions. Every
natural language has ways to specify with great precision.

So, I think that "good Glosa in practice" must use plenty
of those mono-syllabic particles for unambiguous syntax,
and use only multi-syllabic concept-words:

U gina pa kine ad urba (pro plu boteka).    (for the shops)
       ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fe kine ad urba pa es sumptu.    Her trip to town was expensive.
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^

The general drift of all European languages has been toward
compound/periphrastic verb tenses, and Glosa followed that.
I believe it is the best way to go, for any IAL based on
"international scientific vocabulary". All case markings
are prepositioned, all compounding is head-last order.

In all these essential design elements, Glosa is similar to
my favorite IAL, Occidental. I'd like to see Glosa become
a more-highly-evolved version, with more carefully selected
particles and roots than at present. But there remains the
problem of converting all the familiar derivational suffixes.

I think there is no real difference, except possibly, that the
present continuous throws more emphasis on the fact that
somethings is happening now.

The related English word is 'stultify', which comes from
'stultus', Latin for 'foolish'

I rather like 'fatuo'.

Yes. Agreed. I can't see the reason for it, either.

~ne~ not, ~no~ no, and ~ze~ none.

There is an example in 18 Steps in the Richard II translation
where ~ze-pe~ is used for 'no man'.

There is a difference in the words. 
Compare ~ne-ge-game~  unmarried
    ~no-ge-game~ divorced
    ~ze-ge-game~ never-married

But ~nuli~ is none, too. And ~no~/~ne~ seem to confuse just
about everyone at some point. Do we really need to
distinguish "not married now" from "not married and never
was"?

What if we pulled ~ze~ in from basic as a real word (not
just as a suffix), and generally used it instead of ~zero~.
Then, we also get rid of ~nuli~ because ~ze~ means the same
thing. Then, we avoid ~ne~ because it also means
(essentially) ~ze~. Finally, I'm tired of having ~no/non~
forms, so we don't have ~non~ either.

We would then have:
~no~ = opposite
~ze~ = zero, none, lacking,
~anti~ = oppose, against, etc.

~no-kali~ = ugly
~ze-kali~ = lacking beauty
~anti-kali~ = favoring ugliness, or preventing beauty

~no-memo~ = forget (used to know)
~ze-memo~ = no memory (never knew)

~ze-lo~ = nowhere, no place
~ze kron~ = never, no instance
~ze tem~ = instant, no timespan

~ze-fono~ = silent
~no-poli~ = few
~ze-dina~ = powerless, weak

I think I like it. It seems to be much easier to decide
between ~ze~ and ~no~ than it ever was to decide between
~ne~ and ~no~.

Does it mean 'adopt' in this case?
Is it a standard interpretation of 'matri' as a verb? The GID
interpretes 'matri' as a noun 'mother' only...

Wow, I've looked in my English dictionary and found that in English
'mother' can also be a verb... Never met this meaning before... Does
Glosa inherit this interpretation? If so, it msut be specified
explicitly, IMHO... For non-English speakers it not so obvious (for me
it wasn't).

I have some sympathy with patrick if not with his mode of expression.
glosalist seems to be swamped by english, nit picking, hair splitting, 
jargon, esoteric linguistic terminology and so on all very friendly. the 
nits, hairs and so on are very interesting and useful, no doubt some of the 
terminology is if I understoood it. 
could we say to ourselves that  we should have at least 60% of glosalist in 
glosa, try to use glosa if possible ( I am sure that some of those offering 
thoughtful contributions could master enough of g - it is quite easy - to put 
some of their offerings in g and make note of where g fails them - good for 
the developement of g), if you are not a beginner, perhaps you could check 
whether your english would upset the ratio and withhold it a little while. 
what about the more experienced among us contribute things in g that are not 
about g even if a mite trivial - all contributions gratefully received.

Beware of the difference between mothering and fathering!

Greta mothered Bill (acted protectively of)
Mark fathered Jenny (impregnated Jenny's mother)

So Glosa probably should not inherit either one.

English often uses sentence patterns like this:
They are two separate problems for translation but
I just happened to combine them in the example.

1. at/in some time/place/condition, subject verb etc.
2. person thinks/believes (that) such-and-such.

The 2nd case should be simple enough in Glosa
if the elided THAT is restored; or one could try
to add "serial verb constructions" to the syntax.

The 1st case can be "fronted" similarly, since it is
a common enough tactic in many languages. I think.

the time1 is related to time0. In part-sentence/time1, "thought" happened 
before  
sentence/time0 was written/spoken/signed, "will think" will happen after 
sentence/time0 and "think" overlaps, happens with s/time0, so we have 
part-sentence/time1-before, after or with time0 .

Going back to sentence/t0, the first part-sentence "I" existed before 
p-sentence/t1 otherwise "think" wouldn't have happened at all so it is 
part-sentence/before time1, "something" could not exist until "think" allowed 
it to, so it is part-sentence/after     time1. We now have a time order - 
ps/before t1, ps/t1, ps/after t1.

This, I think, is independant of the language used to express it.
Glosa uses this time order for its own word order. This too is independant of 
any other language

   Is it book three of a series, or the third book when counting?
   I can't recall if there is a general affix to mean "number of a series",
as we have -th in English: it could be ~-ra~ [thing] in Glosa;
but I have a thought of something more like ~-me~ or ~-ime~.  But "TH" is
very close to "the" and "thing", so, ~ra~ could be it :-)

 U #3 bibli  OR  #tri bibli       U bibli-tri  .... ~U~ can be elided
 The No.3 book   No. three book    Book three

 The syntax for the NOUN PHRASE should be followed where it is logically
possible to do so:-

  NP indicator  - Numerator  -  Quantifier  - Qualifier(s) - 'noun'
 #determinant#
 OR 'pronoun'

*  It all depends on whether you are thinking in English or in Glosa!

  The nouned verb - or GERUND - is a very handy concept in English, and
while gerunds are functionally nouns in english, everyone knows they come
frome the verb class.

  English                        Glosa

 I like singing.               Mi amo kanta.

 I like to sing.               Mi amo kanta.

Please, please note:
  The Gerundive and the Infinitive in Glosa look and function the same:
they are interchangeable!
  It is only when you decide to translate the Glosa into another language,
OR think in that other language, that you need to place the Glosa
substantive, gerundive/infinitive into one class or another.

  However, for the simple 'nouning' of a Glosa substantive word, I would
say that the simple 'noun' meaning should be assumed - unless context
indicates otherwise.

IE  u vora  =  a meal; an eating    Possibly  u vora-ra ...
                                 to strss the tangible rather than 
                                 the more abstract gerundive concept.
    And then there are always the specific meals: eo-vora, meso-vora 
and vespera-vora.
    But there are always the gastronomes and the gluttons who like evry
meal: their situation may be covered, in Glosa, by saying ...

  ~Mu gluko singo vora-ra: mu simpli hedo vora.~ 
  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
    u kanta  =  a song; a singing

  ~Mi fo hedo audi tu kanta; e mi ski tu fo amo kanta.~
[I very much like to hear your singing/song; and I know you very much love
singing/to sing]

  I can't really say the problem only arises when you try to convert the
Glosa into English, but I'd like to.
  Ron Clark used to say, '' IT IS ALL IN THE CONTEXT: the listener comes
halfway towards the speaker; we never have to treat language as stand-alone
.. there is always CONTEXT!''

  For the Glosa learner, the skill is in intuiting into the language:
perceiving the intent of the authors; and seeking out the various
'universal' constructions that were incorporated to make Glosa universal in
its functioning.  Above all, attempt to THINK IN GLOSA.

>~U nasa de andro es rubi.~    [the man's nose is red]
>
*   On checking _Glosa 6000_, I discovered:-

       TO SMELL  nasa, olface

And, checking the other way:-

       OLFACE  smell

       NASA  nose

So, I'd say you can take your pick (no pun intended).

   However, my feeling is that a 'nasa' is more the thing on one's face,
while 'olface' is more the abstract quality that goes with detecting
smells.  So, for my own idiosyncratic view of language, saying " .. to nose
something .. " sounds more primitive than to " .. detect the olfactory
qualities of something .. ".

   Thus while, in Glosa, I definitely understand and enjoy reading that the
~ju-an pa nasa u kuko vora~, I would, myself, prefer to express it as ~u
ju-an pa olface u kuko vora.~

   But that skirts the question.  While there is a vast bunch of words that
might function as names, actions and descriptions, and sometimes all three
- called "substantives" in Glosa lore - it is patently obvious that some
words are much more related to things, others to actions, and some to
descriptions of things or actions.  So, although Ron Clark said any word
can funtion as any part of speech, the statement is not actually true, but
becomes so when you add two little words.
   Thus the mantra can be:-

          "In Glosa, any substantive word can function, WITHIN
            REASON, as any part of speech."

   So there, we get back to asking the communicator to think, and be
reasonable: maybe this is a tall ask. 
  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
   I would like to comment on Nick's examples, which look, on the face of
it, to be identical structures but with very different syntactic
undercurrents:-

>~U nasa de flori es gluko.~    [smelling a flower is nice] ... (1)  
>~U nasa de andro es rubi.~    [the man's nose is red]  ....... (2)

   And, sorry to say, I do feel it necessary to rearrange the words to
bring the underlying syntax to the surface.

(1)  Un olface de u flori dona gluko.
    [the smell of a flower gives sensory pleasure]

(2)  Un andro nasa habe rubi.
    [the man's nose has (the property of) red(ness)]

   Sad to say, I gave the overused "IS" a drubbing.  Actually, speakers of
English readily use the variant meanings of the word "is" without analysing
the situation.  But, "is" is basically a simple 'equals' sign.  And, if you
keep your English language usage of "is" to that, your use of language
becomes more colourful - and more accurate.

   If you learnt to speak French, you probably got a shock to find that
objects, in French, HAD or MADE qualities, not WERE qualities!

  English                  French             Glosa

The weather is cold.    Il fait froid.    U meteo habe frigo.

>PS I've now been reminded that ~plu~ occurs after 
>the possessive pronoun in standard Glosa texts, so it is not 
>always guaranteed to be the start of a noun-phrase-equivalent.
>Exempla - ~mi plu bibli~ [my books]
>
*   Agreed this does seem like an analogy.
  In the NOUN PHRASE, ~Mi plu bibli~ the pronoun takes precedence over the
plurality indicator.  Once the plurality of the books has been established,
the plurality marker can be elided, leaving the more semantically colourful
word, ~mi~, to do the dual work of starting the NP and establishing ownership.

>>Charles pa grafo tem 2001-11-04:

>>>> Still, Russian does not use articles. And I couldn't say that >>>
RG> Russian is less precise than English, in general.
I agree that Russian is less precise in things like modality, aspect
etc. But Russian adjectives, and, in some cases, verbs can express
subtleties which cannot be expressed in English.

RG> *  This is a very meaningful challenge, and I will be interested to see how
RG> things turn out.  Here is a slew of test sentences from me:-

RG>   a. Id pa es u partikulari kapita-ve; qi un andra pa vide gene ge-vesti
RG> ex u kausa-mort-pe.
RG>    [it was the particular hat, which the man saw being worn by the murderer]
"Eto byla ta samaya shliapa, kotoruyu, po svidetel'stvu muzhchiny,
nosil ubiytsa".
In this sentence "the particular ..." is translated like "ta samaya
..." ("that very ...")

RG>   b. Plu bi kanis pa viole plu tri felis.
RG>     [the two dogs attacked the three cats]
         Dve sobaki napali na tryoh kotov.
(just the same meaning as in English, except there are no articles).

RG>   c. Bi kanis pa viole tri de plu felis.
RG>     [two dogs attacked three of the cats]
If this mean that the dogs attacked three of a previously known group
of cats, in Russian it could be translated as
        Dve sobaki napali na tryoh iz nih.
        [Two dogs attacked three of them]

But if we don't have a special intention to be absolutely clear, we
would say it in the same manner as in (b). The listener can understand
which cats are meant, by context.

RG>   d. Bi de plu kanis pa viole plu tri felis.
RG>     [two of the dogs attacked the three cats]
Similar to (c). In usual speech it could be said as in (b).
But in speech 9not in writing) we could emphasize the intended meaning
my pronouncing "Dve" ("two") emphatically.

RG>   e. U-ci pa eqa u tali di.
RG>     [this  was   such a day]
        Eto byl takoy den'
A demonstrative is used here (similar to English).

RG>   f. Plu agri pa habe plu vario kolori de grasi.
RG>     [the fields had the various colours of grass]
RG>      The fields were the various colours of grass.
In Russian it would be expressed in a slightly different manner:
         Trava na plyah byla raznogo tsveta.
         [The grass on the fields was various colors]
No special particles are used here.
         
RG>   g. Fe loka plu ge-hidra vesti epi u grasi, habe kura de ne loka mu epi u
RG> suela.
RG>     [she puts the wet clothes on the grass, having care to not place them
RG> on the soil]
RG>      She puts the wet clothes on the grass, taking care not to place them
RG> on the soil.
         Ona kladyot mokruyu odezhdu na travu, starayas' ne polozhit'
         eyo na zemlyu.
No special particles are used.
BTW, what is the meaning of articles in this English sentence? Is it
different from
         She puts wet clothes on grass, taking care not to place them
         on soil
?
         
RG>   h. Loka plu sperma intra ge-hidra suela.
RG>     [place the seeds  in     wet    soil]
RG>      Put the seeds into moist soil.
         Polozhite zerna v     mokruyu zemlyu.
         [Put      seeds into  wet     soil]
No special particles are used.

RG>   i. An logi: homi nece casa bufalo.
RG>     [he understands, mankind must chase buffalo]
RG>      He understood, men need to hunt buffalo.
         On ponimayet, chto lyudi dolzhny ohotit'sya na bizonov.
         [He understands, that people (men) need to hunt buffalo]

RG>   j. Tem seki grasi; an gene benifici exercisa. 
RG>     [While cutting grass, he gets beneficial exercise]
         Podstrigaya travu, on priobretayet poleznyj opyt
No particles.

RG> * k. An pa don id a uno-pe.
RG>     [he gave it to someone]
         On dal eto komu-to
         [He gave this to someone]
If 'this' cannot be used here, than we should use either masculine
(he), or feminine (she), or neutral (it) pronoun, depending on the
gender of the object, referred by 'it'.
         
RG>   l. An pa don id ad u persona; qi es intra u kamera.
RG>     [he gave   it to a person, who was in  the room]
         On dal ego/eyo cheloveku, kotoryj byl v komnate
     lit.: [He gave "it/him/her" to man, which was in room]

RG>   m. Uno-pe pa loka id la: mi demanda ke an, alo fe; qi pa akti so, sio
RG> place loka id apo]
RG>     [someone put it there, I ask that he, or she, who did so, (would)
RG> please put it elsewhere]
RG>      Someone put it there, would he, or she, who did so, please remove it.
         Kto-to polozhil eto zdes'; Ya trebuyu, chtoby tot, kto sdelal
         eto, polozhil eto kuda-nibud' v drugoe mesto.
   lit.: [Somone put this here; I demand, that that[person], who did
         this, put this somewhere in another place]

Well, in Russian I'd put it in another manner, not so ugly as it
sounds in literal translation :)))

RG>   m'. Uno-pe pa loka id la: mi demanda ke u persona; qi pa akti so, sio
RG> place loka id apo]
RG>     [someone put it there, I ask that the person, who did so, (would)
RG> please put it elsewhere]
RG>      Someone put it there, would the one, who did so, please remove it.
The same as in (m).

RG>   n. U ciani radikali ( -CN) es mo de plu toxi.
RG>    [the cyanide radical is one of the poisons]
         Radikal tsianida - [eto] odin iz yadov
        [Radical of cyanide is one of poisons]

RG>   o. U ciani radikali es u toxi; qi kausa tanto imedia morta.
RG>    [the cyanide radical is a poison, which causes almost immediate death]
        Radikal tsianida - eto yad, kotoryj privodit k pochti

        [Radical of cyanide is poison, which causes almost immediate
        death]

RG>   p. U ciani radikali ne es u solo toxi.
RG>    [the cyanide radical is not the only poison]
         Radikal tsianida - ne edinstvennyj yad.
        [Radical of cyanide (is) not only poison]
Russian has different words for an adverb 'only' and an ajective 'the
only'.

RG> WITH ELISION
RG>   p'. Ciani ne es u solo toxi.
RG>      [cyanide is not the only poison]
          Tsianid - ne edinstvennyj yad.

Saluta!

Glosalist Archives at Xoom no longer exist. Robin, it is definitely

some time ago, and then later NBCi decided to drop its member

The meaning that goes with the context.

This is standard Glosa. See page 7 of "18 Steps", and page 12
of "Central Glosa".

5 books            penta bibli
the 5th book        u bibli penta

Also see "18 Steps" page 27

Change into 4th / 3rd gear        Kambio a tako tetra / tri.

I feel compelled to comment that "gear" seems to have been
literally translated to "tako" from the English bicyle
idiom "speed". Although it's probably still understandable,
it doesn't seem like the best translation.

I'm not sure we would really have to translate physical
gears grinding away, but it seems like there should be some
concept of discrete gear settings. Perhaps:

 ~Kambio a tako-gradu tetra~

Or on a bike, where the rider is very aware of the gear
wheels, maybe:

 ~Kambio a denti-ciklo tetra~

But then I start to question ~kambio~, which seems to be a
literal translation of "changing" gears, as if it were like
"changing" money (exchanging). Perhaps it would be better
as "shifting":

 ~kine a tako-gradu tetra~

Or, if this is a car and not a bike, perhaps even:

 ~kine u dina-me a tako-gradu tetra~

Or, if we accept that you are really "changing" something:

 ~muta u tako-gradu a tetra~

Yes. I agree with you that both ~tako~ and ~kambio~
seem to be the wrong choice here.

Like it.

> 
>  ~muta u tako-gradu a tetra~

I thought about ~muta~ as well. But this would be transforming
something into something else, so that the original thing is now
not available to change back to and has to be re-created. At least
with 'exchange' you are just swapping between use and non-use.
Even if it sounds like you might need to call in a car mechanic to do it!

How about ~Elekti u ratio tetra~ [Choosing the fourth ratio.]?

Saluta,
Nick

Ne-risko-semani:  http://www.glosa.org es puri e ne habe virus!  Place
sti visita plu pagina itera; kron vi volu.  Saluta ex Marcel.



[And here is the story, which has otherwise nothing to do with Glosa:

Mikhail Adigeyev grafo, 2001-11-09:

When I received Mikhail's translation of the Glosa short information
( http://www.glosa.org/brevi/ruski.htm , thank you, Mikhail!), it was
infected with a virus.

I checked my computer and it was clean.  Mikhail checked his one, and
it was clean, too.  So, the virus could have been on www.glosa.org ,
where he has downloaded the text from, or on the way of e-mail
transfer.

When Mikhail wrote to me, his computer were clean, I knew, I would
have to warn any possible visitor of the site and then exclude the
possibility of an infected www.glosa.org .  But just when I got his
reply, I was in a hurry.  I was just about to leave home for eight
days and for that I had unsubscribed Glosalist before.  So I myself
could not warn you and asked him, if he would do me the favour to do
it.

Now I am back and I have downloaded all files from www.glosa.org and
have checked them with the latest version of the antivirus software
F-Prot ( ftp.complex.is/pub/fp-311.zip ) -- and no virus was detected.

Then I have had a look at all 65 *.htm-files, searching for any
scripts or suspicious attachments -- and I found nothing wrong.

After this I am convinced, that there is no virus on www.glosa.org !

Although Mikhail and me were lucky having no data damaged, this
testing was an annoying loss of time for us and I am very sad about
this world full of destructiveness.  Remember the rebounce for Glosa,
when Robin's PC got a virus and a lot of valuable Glosa material was
lost.]

We need a huge word list when translating from Glosa. We
should use a small word list when translating into Glosa.
My word list tries to serve for translating into Glosa. The
GID serves to help oneunderstand written Glosa material.

I have already worked hard on my list. Perhaps it could be
our initial small list, that we would modify?

Probably you used a HTML editor instead of a plain text editor

I agree, at this point. I would select Latin verbs in the infinitive,
and derive the Glosa form, something like this: (and it's tempting
to use "-re" to mark the finite verb or true infinitive in Glosa)

docere --> doce = teach
dolere --> dole = suffering
ducere --> duce = to lead
durare --> dura = hard, lasting

It is possible to eliminate all of KQWXYZ in spelling the Latin roots.
But there are still many FL FR GR GL CT NG SP ST etc combinations.
Simply allow for a pronounced (but unwritten) schwa to break them up.
Spelling the Latin roots *correctly* in Glosa adds educational value,
and makes vocabulary learning much easier in both directions.
But the Greek roots are impossible and must be eliminated.

I agree. For example, Ptero could be pronounced roughly
'puh-tero'. Xeno can be spoken as 'zeno' or roughly
'kuh-seno'.

I still have mixed feelings about eliminating q and x.

I completely disagree. There are already plenty of
Romance/Latin clone IAL's out there. People who want a
Latin-based language can choose one of them. Glosa's use of
Greek makes it slightly more fair to non-Europeans.

*  Friends, World Citizens, Communicators,

  Despite "terrorism", the world is actually moving into a new phase.

  The thinking brains on this Planet are loostening up: is it something in
the water, an increase in cosmic waves, or just plain old evolution of
civilisation?

  The static thinking, of rigidified categories in a classification imposed
upon us by 'academics,' is being left behind.  People are starting to think
in abstract concepts and symbols: the old "a noun is a noun is a noun"
mentality is giving way to the 'idea of thingness.'

  Yes, we still have 'hard-wired syntactic structures' in our brains, but
people are ^pushing the envelope^, attempting to find novel ways of saying
things - and thinking about things and actions.  Perhaps, just perhaps, a
new and fluid medium for the expression of ideas is called for .. and
emerging .. despite the traditional restrictions of the  traditional,
'concrete' mediums of communication.

  We still don't uderstand the metaphor process, and can't accurately tell
when we are reaching the boundary between metaphors and real symbols for
things and actions --- but that still does not stop us from trying to
extend our use of metaphor and other colourful language (figures of speech).

  And maybe, just maybe, a new more flexible non-rigid communication medium
will emerge in the world .. possibly as a universal language type of thing
.. and possibly something like Glosa!!!

  Was Ron Clark right .. in attempting NOT to confuse people with a
prescriptive Glosa grammar-book?  Was he hoping that people had the
intellectual capacity to use the symbol for the concept they wished to
convey - neither as this part of speech, nor that - but as a 'unit of
thought' placed into a meaningful communication, and made sense of
according to its syntactical relationships?  Or was he running too fast, as
he rushed ahead bearing his 'communicator's torch' - leaving the rest of us
behind with our traditional views of language.

  And so, in less flowery language, Ron was attempting to say that a word
was a symbol for an idea, not a "noun" or a "verb".  Our brain tells us
that some symbols are predominantly understood to be 'thingy' while others
are 'active' - or even almost exclusively one or the other-
but, then, along comes the poet, the novelist ... the writer of modern
lyrics or the person who creates the names for American movies, and we
discover that the old categories and their boundaries can be breached - and
often meaningfully, and creatively, so.
  I suspect that this was the sort of thinking that led Ron Clark to say,
"A word can be used, within reason, as any part of speech."

  Perhaps I could write a fantasy in which, a small green bricks a fast, or
something like that - in Glosa, of course.  But this might be trying too
hard to test the boundaries of word categories.  But, back in pedestrian
language, the correct use of syntax, together with the avoidance of
non-literal language, should ensure that all Glosa sentences are clearly
understandable.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Tue, 20 Nov 2001 08:21:27 -0800 (PST)

I wrote to ask Marcel if I could get permission to update
the "18 steps" document to conform to my unofficial core
list (www.qualitycode.com/glosa).

His response politely suggested that perhaps I should not
tamper with this classic work of art (which other folks are
also working on at the moment), and that my time might be
better spent updating some of the other material.
[Hopefully that's a reasonable summary. Marcel?]

I composed this response to send to him directly, but then
realized that it is quite relevant to the whole group. So
here it is:

---

In my mind, one of the very large obstacles to adoption of
Glosa is that there are now FIVE distinct dialects out
there:
1. 18 steps/PGN
2. Glosa Basic Reference
3. GID core/basic
4. Syd Pidd's reforms (trailing vowels)
5. My own word list

Someone who uses words from any of the five will have some
difficulty communicating with any of the others. I hope
that material created based on my list would be the most
widely understandable because generally my list is a subset
of the others.

My big concern is that "18 Steps" is being listed as the
MOST official source, and it's also the only lengthy
tutorial available. The web page says it is "the best way
to learn Glosa." It is also the most widely translated
material. This will lead new people to learn from it
first...at which point they will find many, many words
which are not in any of the other references.

If "18 Steps" is really an unchangable work of art, it
should be described as that. People should NOT use it as a
first step towards learning Glosa. They should only look
back at it after they have learned "modern" Glosa to gain
perspective.

If we actually want people to learn from "18 Steps", it
must be updated, at least to GID Basic (Core would be
better), if not to my own list. It is disturbing to realize
that Russians will be learning what some of us consider to
be an obsolete dialect of Glosa.

My other option is to create my own tutorial, from scratch,
using my word list. Obviously this would be much more
difficult.

So I close with these questions, to which I would really
like to hear your own personal answers:

What are your goals for the Glosa langauge and community? 

What are the one or two projects someone could do right now
that would have the most impact towards those goals?

What do you see as the biggest weaknesses of the language
(and/or its community) right now? 

Kevin

I don't think anyone can/should "update" or otherwise edit
any copyrighted work without the permission of the author.
Marcel does have a working relationship with the author and
clearly tries to respect her wishes. We others are free to
produce our own works, of course.

But how can we write with any authority about Glosa unless
we have first obtained substantial agreement with many other
Glosa users and/or authorities? I've been on this list for
several years and witnessed very little (or no) agreement
about changing or extending Glosa. And I'd only consider
Wendy or her anointed successor as the true authority.
(I speak personally as just one among the heretics.)

> In my mind, one of the very large obstacles to adoption of

Not really. Only publications of Ron and Wendy are official,
the rest is "merely" amateur fan-club stuff.

It is merely your personal list. On the Occidental email lists,
learners are encouraged to create their own mini-dictionaries.
This is always very useful, but non-canonical. No language has
a closed vocabulary, unless it is dead (unused in real life).
I see the G vocabs as exemplary but provisional; the learner
is supposed to catch onto the patterns of word-formation.

> My big concern is that "18 Steps" is being listed as the
> MOST official source

Marcel is publishing many pages about Glosa on the web,
and surely more people will learn from there than from
any other source. Glosa isn't like a C compiler, it isn't
an exact science and never can be. Lojban has a sort of
automatic translator, though, and you might prefer it.
(I've also mentioned my own online tranlation page.)
But my understanding is that real language just doesn't
work like that (i.e., it is very unlike Lojban or Java).

> If we actually want people to learn from "18 Steps", it
> must be updated

I'd toss all the R&W stuff onto the obsolete v2 pile
and migrate to version 3, if there ever will be such.
I have found several other IALs to be far more usable
than Glosa in its current state, and by a large margin.

> 4. Syd Pidd's reforms (trailing vowels)

i look upon those reforms more as drawing attention  to/revealing  what is 
already there in glosa but is not always obvious. the trailing vowels are not 
enormously important and the experiment with "nng" is something I shall look 
at later, perhaps an item of curiosity. however the other odds and ends could 
be more useful.
my uti-lexiko, I have extended a little as the hyphens cause a problem or 
two. I have updated the web page to include items in glosalist of the first 
half of november and added a list of the words etc minus hyphens and another 
of hyphenated phrases. incidentally, when I write glosa, I use central glosa 
most and burrow into the collection of 6000 and core etc for a few words i 
need but are not in CC
syntax.....
it seems to me that g has something like the following
sentences/plu frasi
part sentences/ plu mero-frasi
these part sentences are ordered by time; the production and delivery of 
sentences  start and finish at definite times, the space between, I shall 
call "time 0"
one part sentence expresses time "think", "am thinking", thought", "will 
think". I shall call this "time 1". Time1 is related to time0. "thought/pa 
puta" started and finished before time0, "will think/fu puta" will start and 
finish after time0, "think" etc overlap, straddle or are with time0. to make 
it clear, i am using "du puta" here.

Well, I've been pondering about the problem few years ago, mostly in
connection with my interest in problems of AI and world
rpresentations... And I had come to a conclusion, that difference
between nouns and verbs is inherent to our human way of thinking. They
are basic categories, and we just cannot think other way. It's similar
to our 3-dimensional model of the world - we just cannot think in
terms of 4-dimensional space or 2-dimensional time...
More precisely, I've come to the following model. All 'objects of
thoughts' can be classified according to their ability to be located
in space and time.
Thus, we have 4 classes:
1) Time intervals: have hard location in time and no location in
space. E.G.: Year 2001.
Time intervals can be identified just be their position in calendar.
2) Spots: have hard location in space and no location in time. E.G.:
Russia.
To identify a unique spot, we should specify its location, relative to
other spots.
3) Situations: have hard location both in space and in time.
We can specify situations by locating them in space and in time (and
specifying the sort of situaion, eg: running, eating, etc).
4) Things: have no location in either space or time. Things are
identified by their unique sets of attributes. When we meet a person
twice in different locations and in different moments, we still
understand that he is the same person :)

To say roughly, verbs describe sorts of situations and nouns describe
sorts of things. This is always true. Say, noun 'rain' describes
a situation (it should be specified both in time and in space -
today's rain is not the same 'object' as yesterday's, and rain in
Washington is not that very 'object', as rain in Moskow, even if they
are simultaneous).

So, I believe that we _do_ think in terms of things and situations,
and any language should have this distiction in it.

Yes, because that was his intention and Hogben's, to escape
from Latin/Greek grammarians and the failed foreign language
teaching approaches of the postwar period. And yes, because
the pidgin-creole approach is probably the best/easiest/fastest
way to connect people of vastly different cultural backgrounds.
Examples: Lingua Franca (Sabir) and the Chinook Jargon.

Linguists say there are more like 50 or 100 "parts of speech".
They vary a bit in each language but with a lot of similarity.
Rather than give a philosophical name and description to each
official category, though, we could define them operationally,
by means of "sentence frames". This follows Ron's intuition.
I think there should be approx 50 or 100 of them ...

the FIFTH cat ... ordinal number
the FIVE cats ... cardinal number

that SEX-ACT was legal ... deverbal noun
he SEX-ACTED her ... transitive verb
she got SEX-ACTED ... intransitive-passive

the GREEN was ugly ... deadjectival noun
the GREEN colors ... plain adjective

I'm not good at collecting samples, sorry.  Anyway, what's
important is the left-hand side of the examples, and their
Glosa translations, not the right-hand side terminology.
A better set of frames came with WordNet, but I can't
find them now.

intro-vera should be intro-verba
basically, a g mero-frasi/part sentence would have:
intro-verba, word helping the next word, word helping the next word, head 
word, preposition phrases helping the head word. 
the next intro-verba or pre-loka-verba would point to the head word before it 
-
"the thin and very tall man with long and dark brown hair is ...... "
"the" introduces, "very" helps "tall", "thin" and "tall" help "man", "with" 
shows that "man" is the head word, "dark" helps "brown", "long" and "brown" 
help "hair", "is" begins the next part sentence.
"u tenu e fo alti andro ko longi e skoto bruno kapila es ......    "
plu de intro-verba:-
"pa" introduces a part sentence with time/mero-frasi-tem, also states 
relation between the time and the time of another part sentence 
"fu" does as "pa" does
"du" does as "pa" does but is less essential - as "es" is used almost always 
as mero-frasi-tem, it can be left out as the speaker wishes
"u" intros a mero-frasi-pre/po-tem, also carries single number
if pre-tem, it comes before the mero-frasi-tem, if po-tem, it comes after.
"ko" intros a mero-frasi-no-tem, single number. if plural, "plu" is also used.
"ge" is attached before the main word in a mero-frasi-tem. this indicates 
that the mero-frasi-po-tem (object) is before the mero-frasi-tem instead of 
after.
"the woman opened the door"   - "u gina pa aperi u porta"
"the door was opened by the woman"  - u porta pa ge-aperi per u gina"
also?
u porta pa subito ge aperi......
u porta ge subito aperi .....
ge porta pa aperi .....
???
I am trying to avoid using words such as:- present indicative, past historic, 
subjunctive, subject, indirect object, prepositional phrase, conditional 
clause, noun, verb adjective and a whole host of really juicy odds and ends 
that I've forgotten thankfully. I think that you'll find most of the above 
already in use in glosa so it's not too revolutionary.

*  Yes, Kevin,
   As I found (~1982-1992) things were a bit fluid during the 'evolution'
of Glosa.  I was very relieved when the _GLOSA 6000_ (1992) was published.
   Then, I still had to check from front to back of this bi-directional
dictionary to make sure I had the right word .. but I accepted this as a
part of the teething troubles, and assumed that a cleaned up version of
_Glosa 6000(Revised)_ would be produced with the aid of computer sorting
and the making of a standardised lexicon.
   It didn't quite happen this way, and Paul Bartlett was the first to
proclaim loudly that there were at least two or three varying "Glosa 1000"
word-lists.
   What had been a problem of the excesses of creativity, had become a
serious 'marketing' dilemma.
   Then, I attempted to form a standard Glosa lexicon by reversing the
GLOSA-ENGLISH list from _GLOSA 6000_, and this only showed that there were
more synonyms than we had bargained for.  Ron and Wendy, in their
enthusiasm threw in more Greek and Latin roots than were warranted.

   That was when I presented the problem to the Glosalist seeking
assistance; and, although we had long discussions about the optimal length
of the desired lexicon revision, each tended to follow his own inclination,
and ultimately a range of Glosa electronic dictionaries was produced.

   I felt a little exhausted by this activity, and thought, as Ron had,
that usage would tend to knock the rough edges off the language, as we all
started communicating in Glosa and writing stories and articles using Glosa.

   BTW, Wendy Ashby asked me to submit items for the upcoming PLU GLOSA
NOTA, so I would suggest that everyone supports her in this, and sends in a
short fictional work or an article for publication.  My guess is that Wendy
will edit items to be in line with Glosa 6000 spelling and standard PGN usage.
 - - - - - - - - - 
   But this is all a long way from "18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa."

   Yes you were right to open the discussion to all.  Perhaps "18 Steps ...
" is a "classic work of art", but it can readily be bettered as a first
reader.  So, I welcome your efforts, Kevin, and suggest that you have a
look at other introductory language readers, to give you an idea of the
different possible approaches.  When "18 Steps ... " was written, it was
aimed at the African learner of Glosa, so it was published in inexpensive
paper format.  Also, the economy cut both ways: Ron and Wendy could afford
neither the production of a thick printed book, nor the postage to their
enthusiastic learners in Africa of a wieghty tome. 
   Now, taking the world view, I imagine that Internet format is the
least-cost mode, and that printed versions can be run from electronic
master copies.
   The Web version of something like "18 Steps ... " could include HTML
coded hypertext links, some of which could call up sound.  I still have not
got organised into the technology of putting sound on the Web, but some on
this list might have the technology to do it.  
   The world has changed a lot since the production of "18 Steps ... ," and
while it can still be used to good effect, future learning materials can
range from possibly a little better .. to exciting audiovisuals, probably
in electronic format.

*   Where would you place _GLOSA 6000_ in this schema?  Do you have a copy
of this 1992 publication?  If not, I will organise to get one to you: all I
need is your land address.
    I must visit your website to see how your word list looks.

*   I did not realise this.  However, if the words they learn are valid
Glosa words, no harm is done.  I ought to peruse my copy, to see if these
words are instances of Old Glosa.

*   Basically, there should be 'no turning back.'  The only reason for
studying the formative publications is for academic research of Glosa, and
the world is not doing that, yet.  So, "18 Steps ... " can stay in the
archives while a more up to date 'First Reader' - Glosa-wise and
educationally -  is prepared.

*   This is all painfully true.
    I mean we could have a Glosalist competition for the most suitable
update of the "18 Steps ... " as it stands.  This would serve to give us
all a look at the way the different members of the group interpret it into
current Glosa .. leading quickly, I would hope, to a concensus version,
that all agreed was the best line through the 'versions' of Glosa you
describe - with the whole exercise acting as a standardising influence, as
well.

*   Probably better, but involving more variables, and a longer production
time.  I would go with the concensus upgrade of the historical "18 Steps
... " as a first task; this could be completed before Christmas.

*  1. Development of community of fluent users of Glosa - possibly written

   2. Availability of a group of Glosa speakers, so that IF, or WHEN, world
leaders call for selection of an International Auxiliary Language, Glosa
will be represented by a team.
   3. Fun.  Global communication has to be fun or its not worth doing.
   4. A meeting of progressive minds.

*  A. Preparation of one definitive Beginner's Lexicon - of possibly 2500
words, having synonyms for only a few common concepts.
   B. Preparation of a standard paper instruction book, but with standard
rules, reading passages, and short lists of questions for each chapter.
   C. Production of interesting Audio-visual sequences of Glosa
instruction, aimed at circulation through websites and on CD.
   D. Glosa comics.  This would be fun for the more visually oriented Glosa

>What do you see as the biggest weaknesses of the language

*  Language: Need for agreement on a standardised lexicon.
             As a concept-based language with syntax based grammar, Glosa
does not have the comfortable feel of a native language with all of the
usual inflections: speakers of Glosa have to think before they speak.
             The lack of a complete lexicon - all the vegetables,fruits,
animals, trees, etc. 
             Although well-written Glosa is a pleasure to read, because of
lack of morphological grammar, it is very extremely easy for the
over-confident learner to write very bad Glosa: the syntactic signposts are
in the head, not provided by visible and audible inflection.   

  Community: Appears to be stuck at the 'vocabulary formation' stage.
             Few fluent writers and speakers.
             African learners, especially in Uganda, are being starved of
contact with other Glosa-pe.
             + +  Development of Glosa segments to websites is a very
encouraging sign among the more affluent learners.

Saluta,

  P.S. I feel that with a more positive global intellectual climate there
would be exponential growth of Glosa usage.  Also, I feel that in the same
way that the world's knowlege should be freely available to all, such
global information could be available in one language medium, and Glosa is
suitable for this task.

deciding on an attempt at bringing "18 Steps ... " up to date.
   However, I do suspect that a combined Glosalist group revision would be
a very good idea.  As long as it was "rebadged" suitably, people would know
that it was a recent group effort .. possibly by reading the year: "18
Steps to Fluency in Glosa (Revised 2001)" (c) Glosa Education Organisation.

*   Actually, Kevin's word-lists fill in terminology that has not been
covered by the 'official' lexicon, but fairly soon needs to be; as such, it
is an adjunct to the existing lexicon.  I believe that the Glosalist group
ought to set up a mechanism that encourages subject- matter experts to
learn Glosa with a view to creating specialised Glosa lexicons in their
particular areas.
    If we can act like efficient scientists, we can agree on a mechanism to
discuss (ever so briefly) Kevin's terms and reach agreement, preferably by
concensus, to adopt them or the group-preferred alternatives - within a set
time.  We really ought to work to deadlines, so that no discussion drags on
endlessly.

*  Some how, with Wendy's agreement, the total group ought to be able to
reach concensus on the basic spelling  (and derivation) of each Thesaurus
item/lexicon entry.  After that, the release of different amounts of the
lexicon in Glosa 1000, Glosa 2500, and a revised and standardised Glosa
6000, could follow.

What's needed is an algorithm to select vocabulary. It could be re-run
periodically for updates. When I challenged the Interlingua "experts",
they were unable to describe any effective, repeatable, objective method.
But it's possible to derive the Glosa vocab according to clear principles
by a published computer program using public data sources.

Recently I've been experimenting with a "language sound change" program,
running English through it without regard to semantics, similar to how
language evolves. It's basically another "English spelling reform" but
with a few twists. Imitating what seems Ron Clark style, it simplifies
the alphabet and shoehorns all English words into easily pronounceable
CVCV-ish bisyllables. (C.S. people call it a hash table.)

The "euro-international" names of the days of the week are based on
astrology, sun-day moon-day mars-day mercury- jupiter- venus- saturn-.
But with usage they became smoothed out a bit. Here are some day names
cranked out by my program, just for fun, sorted by frequency:

26342   todu    today
19507   jeste   yesterday
9364    sundu   sunday
8310    satu    saturday
7783    joli    holiday
5540    fridu   friday
5286    mondu   monday
4406    vedne   wednesday
3722    fursu   thursday
3568    tesdu   tuesday
3247    birfu   birthday
1018    duli    daylight
555     midu    midday
536     duti    daytime
184     vekdu   weekday
49      dudra   daydream

This is just from the BNC corpus, English-only; one could include other
lists for a more international flavor. The words automatically "compete"
for their positions, no subjective judgement or hand-tuning is ever needed.
The top-3000 words would be the "core" list by definition. It looks like
8000 or so root-concept-words will cover the entire set (approx 100,000
distinct English words). This style of reform, basing decisions on an
objective basis, escapes the limitations of the "artlang" approach.

Very cool project...

But I don't think Glosa needs it. I think Glosa can be
gently nudged as needed, rather than completely overhauled.
If we overhaul it, it won't be Glosa.

If you do create your own auxlang, I would be very
interested in hearing about it.

I think one of the reasons this has not happened is because
there are too many words in G6000 and the full GID. As new
people learn a language, if they are given a wide choice of
words, each will naturally choose a variety of words.

I guess that's mostly because many people probably learn
Glosa by themselves, from word lists. There isn't enough
existing Glosa material, or enough ongoing discussions IN
Glosa for people to learn that way.

6000 words is far too many for everyday usage. I'm not sure
such a work should even exist, but if it does, people
should be discouraged from using it.

As you move beyond 1000-2000 words, almost all the
additions should be specific names of plants, animals, and
scientific terms, and/or compounds that build on existing
roots. We don't need twelve roots that mean "happy".

"GLOSA 6000" was published in April 1992.

The latest (3rd revised edition) of
"18 STEPS to FLUENCY in EURO-GLOSA"
was published in September 1992. This is the
version that Marcel has put extracts of on his site.

The book was first published in 1985, and also
appeared in a revised 2nd edition in 1989.

Saluta,
Nick

I would be willing to produce a version based on my own
word list. First, I would need to know that this would be
ok from a copyright standpoint--both legally and ethically.
Second, I would like to know that it would actually be read
by enough people to be worth doing.

Yes, it could. Is anyone else interested?

Oops. I forgot about those. I suspect G1000 would be pretty
close to the first (18 steps/PGN), although I doubt it fits
exactly. I would consider G6000 to be yet another, as it
must have so many words as to be completely overwhelming.

I appreciate this offer, but I don't think I have any use
for a 6000 word list. Honestly, I believe that in an IAL,
less is more. Easier to learn. Easier to remember. Easier
to look things up. Easier to be more clear (although less
precise) in your communications.

Please do. I have only had a couple bits of feedback so
far. http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa

Me too. I hadn't considered the spoken part, but I suppose
I could enjoy internet voice chats in Glosa.

As I've said before, this is by far my biggest Glosa goal.
I want Glosa to be a viable medium for exchanging
information across languages, and to get there it needs to
build a larger base of speakers.

Absolutely.

Yes. Mental stimulation. Teamwork. Great.

Interesting. I have trouble imagining a paper book getting

Again, I hadn't thought of moving beyond the written word.
These would certainly give Glosa an unusual edge.

Other projects I am considering:
1. Creating a true Glosa Dictionary. Each Glosa word would
have a definition written in Glosa.

2. Adding additional translations (besides English) to my
word list. I think I could pretty easily tweak my software
to allow any number of languages to coexist in the same
file (Spanish, Russian, etc).

How valuable to you all think either of these would be?

Agreed. But how can we reach "standardization"? Would that
require Wendy's participation and approval? Or has the
language community grown to the point where the original
author(s) become just one voice among many?

Participants in this list do not seem to be active or
involved enough to actually "vote" on issues that come up.
When issues do arise, I don't think we reach consensus very
often.

>           The lack of a complete lexicon - all the

That would be interesting. I have thought about having
multiple "add-ons" to the core word list. If you are
interested in technical issues, add the technical list.
Some people might add the anatomy list, or the foods list,
or whatever. That way, the core list can remain simple.

Well put. Some of my early Glosa writing is unclear because
I kept too many signposts in my head, instead of explcitly
writing them out. I'm very slowly going back and updating
that text (and at the same time updating the vocabulary to
match my streamlined word list).

>Community: Appears to be stuck at the 'vocabulary

Agreed. There seem to be about five or ten of us here. And
in the long time I've been monitoring the list, I think
that number has only gone up by one or two.

>             African learners, especially in Uganda,

Very interesting. I wasn't even aware of them. I assume
they have no (or very limited) internet access. My own life
is so tightly bound to the computer, I'm not sure I could
help there. Perhaps we could set up some kind of system to
automatically route any in-Glosa postings to a monthly
printed newsletter?

---
I would add a couple more community weaknesses:
1. Aside from the recent and very welcome influx of Russian
speakers, we remain very English-centric. I would love to
have a Glosa site similar to the Romanova site, which
offers information in MANY languages.

2. The members of this list seem more interested in
learning about (or debating :-) Glosa, rather than actually
using it.

I believe that all the GLOSA  6000 words are included in GID.

I agree. One of the major design aims of the Interglossa/Glosa
Project was to produce a language with "word economy".

See what Hogben had to say on the subject.
http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/paraleli.htm


The Glosa authors also very frequently stress that Glosa has
two vocabularies; Mega Glosa and Central Glosa.

Plu Glosa Nota 37 is a typical example

"We agree that to sell Glosa to bodies such as EEC, UN, 
UNESCO etc. MEGA-GLOSA, a large vocabulary is 
essential. Scientists, literary people and politicians require 
it. 

"We however insist that GLOSA 1000 must remain the 
Centre, the Heart of Glosa. Glosa is a truly International 
Auxiliary Language. It will appeal to the motivated Third 
World artisan only if it is simple to learn and accurate, and 
able to deal with all kinds of information exchange. Glosa 
will not be allowed to fall into the trap of becoming only 
a holiday language for wealthy people of the industrialized 
nations. The world will never be healthily united until 
accurate information is readily available to everyone 
everywhere, and everybody in the world has enough to eat, 
good shelter and a good all-round education - an education 
for living not merely for earning a living. The world has now 
the means (but not yet the will) to bring all this about quickly 
and thoroughly. 

"Europeans are used to large vocabularies, which can contribute 
to mis-understandings not only between nations but also 
between classes. We hope that although perhaps enjoying the 
variety and freedom of Mega Glosa people will at the same 
time work their way up to Central Glosa 1000."

Whilst Christians, Jews and Muslims have their 'special' day of the week on
Sunday, Saturday and Friday respectively. They are all in agreement that
Sunday is the first day of the week.

Interestingly, Hebrew also uses numbers for the names of the days of the
week.

Slavs think of Friday as the fifth day, for example Russians call it
"pyatneetza". And also some calendar printers put Monday as the
first day of the week, but this is far from being universal practice.

Year numbering is more controversial. But "Common Era" dates (C.E.),
which are the same as A.D. dates, are the most international, and, of
course, are not actually related to the birth year of Jesus of Nazareth.

I think Ron made the right decision. It is much easier to remember which day
to count from
than to remember 7 relatively arbitrary week day names in the right order.
Even more so
when it comes to 12 month names.

I just added it to my website. However, it's currently in
the raw form which gets converted to HTML by a Ruby
computer program (also posted on my site). If you can
describe a simple text format (or XML) that you would like
me to convert it to, I can write a program to make it
available in that format as well.

This sounds exactly like what I have started. My plan is
that each Glosa entry in my list can have separate attached
information for each language. The Glosa field would
contain a definition written in Glosa. It would have
English, Spanish, Russian, and any number of additional
fields for additional languages.

My computer program could generate HTML which would contain
any single language, any two languages, or all languages.

There may be a way to have a program automatically do the
translation from the Glosa list, and then I could write a
program to pull the results back into the list
automatically. Then humans could correct any
mis-translations.

Ah. Yes, I was right: it is overwhelming. So I would add
another dialect to my list:

6. G6000/Full GID

Hopefully G1000 is fairly similar to both 18 steps/PGN
and/or GID core/basic. I'm not sure if it's really close to
either, or if it would end up being dialect #7.

I'm using the word dialect as a layperson--I don't know if
it's technically correct from a linguistic viewpoint. Also,
it is really a gray area--I don't know if I would consider
something to be distinct only if it had a 1% variation in
words, or 20%. 

I just know that someone who uses 18 steps vocabulary will
have some trouble communicating with someone who uses GID
core (to pick just one example).

By the way, I object to calling each wordlist a "dialect".
It's especially unhelpful for an auxlang. Maybe if would be
fair to call Hogben's Interglossa one of the two dialects
of Glosa. Whoever takes over control of Glosa after Wendy
will probably generate the 3rd ...

Ron Clark did derive "Glosa 1000+" from Roget's Thesaurus.
There are now far better ways to select vocabulary, such as
EuroWordNet or other ideas I've discussed here previously.
The only wrong way to do it is to hand-pick as in an artlang.
For the survival of Glosa, and more so for any possible future
growth, it must become an ongoing committee-standardized and
regularly updated product (even if free, like Linux).

*   I could not agree more.

    At present, the subscribers to Glosalist + Wendy Ashby comprise such a
"standardising committee."

    Were the members of Glosalist .. using a suitable standard list, such
as that from _EuroWordNet_ .. to be able to agree upon an approx. 1000 word
list for Glosa, that would be a start.

    This should not be an impossability, but it would suggest the need for
some painful thinking on the part of those wishing to "improve" upon the
various, existing basic Glosa word-lists.

    Were we to agree on using one standardised list, such as that suggested
by Charles, _EuroWordNet_, then we would certainly add credibility to the
exercise; this sort of thing takes Glosa from hobbyist level to committee
level, and would give the project more authority - as seen through the eyes
of UN and EC committees that decide on things like Universal Standards.

    Wendy Ashby would have to be informed of our actions before we started
on such a venture, because she would need to be part of the process: were
she on the Net, I would CC: this message to her; as things are, I will have
to print out and post hardcopy of our deliberations to her.

    Please Charles, is a suitable version of the EuroWordList available for
forwarding to the Glosalist as an attachment?  Do other members of this
list have an alternative standard that they feel is superior to that
proposed by Charles?  If the selection of a standard is the first step,
then such a decision should be possible within one month; alternatively, if
there is no objection, the basic EuroWordList can be agreed to by majority
vote, or concensus, within two to four weeks.

    While Wendy is not getting too old to wait for further delays, I, at
65, might be.  If we, as a group, are to get serious, and to phase up to
the professional level, then there is no room for the luxury of endless
discussion: I would like to bring the matter .. of the embarrassing range
of "Glosa 1000/Basic Glosa" lists .. to a head, and suggest that we work -
to proposed 'deadlines' - to arrive at one 'basic' list.

    IF we can do this, then we can press forward to derive standardised
lists at the "Glosa 2500" and "Glosa 6000" marks.  Of course the obvious
approach is to create one comprehensive lexicon, of say 6000-odd words, and
snip backwards, selecting "Basic" and "Learner" vocabularies from this.
However, such an approach might assume a singularity of purpose beyond that
of the Glosalist subscribership: I believe that the formation of the
smallest standardised list would 'test' our integrity as a group, and, as
such, might determine whether, or not, Glosa has a future.

    The technical language extensions to Glosa, suggested by Kevin Smith,
are vitally important to the growth of Glosa as a potential Global
Auxilliary; but, such extension need to be built onto a firm foundation;
it is the lack of a standardised lexicon that prevents many Glosa
enthusiasts from progressing into normal spoken use of the language.  Once
the foundation is reasonably well set (of course with rules for alterations
to the language with cultural change) there will be a redirection of energy
into the creation of a "corpus" (collection of original works written in
Glosa), and the language will start growing again.

Saluta,

I'd like to see an official "Glosa Advisory Group" named by Wendy.
An official "GAG" should probably be 3 or 5 appointees. Concensus
should be defined as 51% or nothing will ever be agreed to ...
This e-list could be the place to discuss issues in public.
Something similar was done with Occidental and Novial approx 1930.

I want to be sure everyone realizes that I have two very
different word lists up on my site. First, I believe Robin
is referring to my "Techno" word list. I see this as an
adjunct, and not critical for Glosa's success.

The other (and more important) work is my set of three
"unofficial core" lists (Glosa-English-alphabetical,
Glosa-English-categorized, and English-Glosa-alphabetical).
This is the list that I would like to see replace (or
strongly influence) GID Core and/or G1000.

Does it have to be in book form? If I sent you a nice
printout of my unofficial core list, would you use it? What
if it were bound by a local print shop?

Um. You are agreeing that we should discard everything that

I would also be interested in hearing specific ways that
other IAL's are more useful. However, I will personally
disregard any argument based on Euro-ness being an
advantage, since I believe an IAL should not be Euro.

My point is that Glosa does not actually work, to the degree
some other IALs do. There are too many gaps in its definition
and it doesn't have a sufficient "speech community" to soften
rough edges by usage. So a thorough re-modeling is needed.
But I do *not* want to discuss other IALs here; I'm saying
that I know of (at least) one that does work well for me.
Some say no IAL or any IAL is "good enough"; I disagree.

> Um. You are agreeing that we should discard everything that

A more careful reading would not have lead to that assumption.
Glosa is better than Interglossa, but still needs more work.

	It may be that some issues are not amenable to "votes". I
	would think one would have to have extensive knowledge on the
	etimology of Greek and Latin words.

	I do no "vote" here, because I don't see my self as a person
	with sufficient knowledge. In fact, I tend to think such
	proposition - that a vocabulary should be voted on this list -
	kind of dangerous for Glosa.

	Just my 2 cents...

I don't want to discuss one IAL versus another, because
such discussions always become unpleasant disputations.
Actually, I like all of them, and so-called artlangs too.
My own experience to try many of them and eventually
settled on one as "best": Occidental, designed for those
who already know at least one other European language and
have at least studied some others. But if people want to
discuss other IALs, I urge that it be done off-list.

Glosa has a different idea, to use analytical grammar and
non-Latin roots, for a global audience that is non-European.
It more closely approximates a pidgin/creole like the
Lingua Franca or Chinook Jargon or even Indonesian, and
theoretically should be easiest to learn. I've seen a few
other projects somewhat like Glosa (Lingua Franca Nova, Tunu)
and believe that Glosa needs to be improved in many ways.

Yes.

Tunu was worth a peek--thanks for the link. LFN seems like
another Euroclone to me, but I agree with your earlier
statement: let's not discuss other languages in detail
here.

Should I search the archives for the things you feel should
be improved in Glosa? Or can you restate them briefly?
(Aside from vocabulary, which you've clearly stated you're
not happy with).

My opinions have evolved a lot, and continue to do so ...

Generally, Glosa principles need to be clearly defined.
Then it can be extended and updated by people other than
the author-artist. As it is, there are bits of everything
but no real system -- and lots of contradictions. In an
"engineered" language this is unacceptable, though as a
prototype it's an interesting experiment.

Should the "scientific vocabulary" and Latin prefixed verbs
and mangled Greek roots all be thrown together into the pot?

Should there be any affixes, and if so should they be
prefixed or suffixed? Why select derivational suffixes
like -DO when the full word is only 2 syllables and fits
the "no morphology except compounds" scheme? Why have
GE- for something like a past/passive participle but
not have any present/active participle? Etc.

As for vocabulary, why not stipulate that Roget's headwords
and/or Euronet's top ontology and/or Kanji-6000 as the
official set of roots? And then systematically relex them
to a pure bisyllabic CVCV scheme that fits the phonology?

And then let's see some realistic translations, without the
parochial English idioms, to compare with the equivalent text
in other languages.

Draconian pronouncements, e.g "all Greek roots" or "pure relex"
would be more acceptable to me than the current mish-mash.
Maybe what I'd like best is basically a renewed Lingua Franca.
Others will have very different preferences, naturally,
and it would be interesting to hear them.

are my emails coming through any better than they were? I have had one 
indication that it might be so and my PC has had some checking over and 
ajustments from mr Jenning's engineers.

a little rambling:-
glosa started as words from latin and greek plus syntax from england. This 
made it easy to use by europeans especially me, g is the easiest language I 
have come across.  The people who are using it and discussing it are , on the 
whole, a pretty brainy lot and can cope with several languages and technical 
terms etc. they tend to forget that that g should be aimed at simpler folk. 
But, g should become a language of its own, let us forget the latin, greek 
and english, it has, on various web sites and glosalist computers, a pretty 
comprehensive and useable vocabulary and hidden away to some extent, its own 
syntax. We should be making them all clear for our simpler folk like a 75 
year old englishman with patches of confusion and memory loss to trouble him.
Looking back over the last 60 years or so, g and glosalist can claim credit 
for a miracle or two, a german and englishman on friendly terms and working 
together, russians and americans doing the same - things were not always like 
that. Over the last few years I have exchanged ideas through glist and pgn 
and in g, with people from china, uganda, greece,   sweden, germany russia 
usa  for instance. g is a success , small perhaps but a success
it can stand alone, it has fledged, ............

There is a mass of data and it's easy to get lost in it;
prepare to wade through a lot of academic bureaucratese ...
what we want is the "1024 Common Base Concepts".

http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/data.htm
http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/topont.htm
http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/corebcs.html (164 top concepts)

At this point we should be adding words, not subtracting any.
But the personal efforts to identify "core" subsets are a good
exercise. In a full dictionary, the 1000 most frequently used
words should be highlighted. IMHO.

> Do other members of this
> list have an alternative standard that they feel is superior

There are several other good options, and they could all be
done independently and additively. The 6000 Kanji taught to
all Japanese students are a very good alternative. And the
example of Tunu shows how this might look:

a/an            SpE LDV SFL BNC  bija
ability/able    SpE LDV SFL BNC  nilo
about           SpE LDV SFL BNC  naju
above           SpE LDV SFL BNC  bamo / situ
abroad              LDV          mite
absence/absent      LDV          lalaju

The author has taken Rick Harrison's meta-list of English
vocabulary, which includes Special English, top-1000 of BNC,
Longman's Defining set, and Eaton's list ... at my suggestion,
BTW ... and provided the Tunu equivalents on the right. Tunu
is another analytic style IAL like Glosa.

I have several other English vocab lists from the time we last
discussed "what is core?" on this e-list. Let 1000 flowers bloom.

this is from "recruitable" a publication by an organisation to help get

"Recruitable helps people who want to work, to find a job"

auxi, volu, ergo, detekti are tem-mero-frasi/tem-verba-grupo/verbs

R is earlier than auxi, qi is earlier than volu-ergo, and also earlier than 
detekti so precede those verb phrases
pe is later than auxi, ergo-loka is later than detekti so are after the verb

pe and ergo-loka need intro-words

so:-
"R  du auxi plu pe qi volu ergo te detekti plu ergo-loka"

> what we want is the "1024 Common Base Concepts".

I just uploaded a reformatted list derived from the
EWN data files: http://catty.com/~catty/lang/bc.dat
and it looks like this using "set tabstop=20" in vi ...

Variant-1:          aim 2
Gloss:              the goal intended to be hit
Hyperonym:          end 5
TO3:                MentalObject
Literal:            04029556-n
SituationType:      3rdOrderEntity
Cause:              Stimulating
Phys/Ment:          Mental
Purpose:            Purpose

Variant-1:          aim 3
Gloss:              an anticipated outcome that guides your planned actions
Hyperonym:          end 5
TO3:                MentalObject
Literal:            04030116-n
SituationType:      3rdOrderEntity
Cause:              Stimulating
Phys/Ment:          Mental
Purpose:            Purpose

.. etc. Not user-friendly, but tractable and meaty.
The most important fields are just the top 4 (above "Literal")
but I included them all (except, empty fields were deleted).

Subject: [glosalist] vocab lists

I revisited the lists done in august 2000. They were 7 lists
of "essential" English vocabulary compiled by various people.
Any dictionary for Glosa would have to translate at least the
top few thousand items that appear in most of them, and I feel
that they should all be one-root words rather than compounds.

The sources were:
Paul Bartlett's list
Rick Harrison's metalist
Tunu vocab
General Service List
Top 10000 from the BNC
Kilgariff's list
Yang's learner list

I've now added the EuroWordNet set, but it wasn't very useful;
only 117 new entries, and just 650 or so in total. All 8 lists
were merged/sorted, and a count made of how many lists included
each word. I think that adding 100 more lists would not change
the results much.

193 words appear on all 8 lists, 832 appear on 7 (or more) lists,
1532 are on 6+ of the lists, 1990 on 5+, 2441 on 4+, 3310 on 3+,
5437 on 2+, 9629 in all. Those that appear only once include
some flaky stuff like abbreviations; the 3-or-mores look pretty
reliable. Anyway, it's uploaded for any who care, at:
