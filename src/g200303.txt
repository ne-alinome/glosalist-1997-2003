I am sorry for this warning: the Glosa books may disappoint you.

I just wanted to answer your letter and make a translation suggestion
for you.  But before sending it, I saw, you have been quicker:

I received a mail from you, 2003-03-01:

Thank you very much!  I wish you good luck for your business.  I just
registered.

Unfortunately the user community of Glosa is very small.  It would not
make much sense to devide the few communication in/about Glosa to two
discussion forums yet, I fear.  On the other hand, glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org
is not very comfortable and often spammed.

Please let me quote the text from your website and send it to
Glosalist.  It is certainly very interesting for the other
Glosa-people.

Hi again,

It has probably been realized by many but maybe someone has to say it and
that someone is probably me: Perhaps if organisations like Andy's Penpals
become interested in Glosa, then perhaps the worldwide Glosa community would
not be so small as I think it probably is at present. Andy's Penpals is not
exactly small with over 16,000 members, though not all active, and over
14,000 unique visitors to all sites per month, but then not exactly big by
Internet standards. But our problem is that our Users tend to be very
conservative (with a small c) as anyone can see from the small numbers of
members who are joining the Forums. But a few signed up followed by a few
more and so on, so perhaps the few will turn into the many in time. Maybe
it'll be this way with Glosa.

Anyway, getting the books is not going well, so I've written a letter to the
Organisation in Surrey for a list of books and hopefully I'll receive a
reply soon. Marcel's web site is invaluable and I congratulate him on a job
well done. I had no hesitation in linking to it. Why Glosa? Well, it's
something new and perhaps we and our users need something new to revive us.
And, of course, an international language is a very attractive proposition
for any international organisation. We'll stick with it until hell freezes
over and the results will probably be what the results will be.

I'll end by sincerely apologising for posting in English and maybe I'll be
able to post in Glosa soon. Maybe someone can translate this post into Glosa
for me?

With very best wishes,
Anthony

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sun, 2 Mar 2003 11:19:32 EST

Beause of memory problems, I have difficulty with languages new [and 
sometimes old] to me. so.....

"The quick":- here we have an NP introducing word and what might be the 
phrase's head word, the noun. i.e. ' The quick of my thumb hurts' ......
"The quick brown":- no, 'quick modifies the head noun 'brown'  highly 
unlikely! ......
"The quick brown fox" 'fox' is the head 'q...', 'b...', are modifiers.
"The quick brown fox jumps":- we have a verb. 
"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog":- we now have a meaningful 
sentence.
However, those of you with better eyesight than mine will have noticed the 
lack of a full stop after dog. To finish the sentence, we have, 
"   ...................... dog are very high.   ". The subject head noun is 
now 'jumps'. 
I've had to wade through the sentence forming ideas of the structure, 
cancelling them, reforming them and so on.

"The jumps, fox quick and brown, over the dog, lazy do have the height, 
great"  intro word, head, modifiers 
"The fox quick and brown does jump over the dog lazy"
I know by the second word in the phrase which is the head/important and can 
pay less attention to the modifiers.
To rob glosa,
"U vulpe tako e bruno nu salta su u kanis indole.
To mathematically maul the Roget thesaurus,
'na jikeju gasi je kiga  vi goki  su nu jiki pavufo -'

Are there any conlangs that use intro + head + modifiers as a construction?

I think you've identified the main problem with Glosa in its present form: 
sentence parsing.  Hogben was quite clear originally that syntax is one of the 
main stumbling blocks in learning a new language, and especially in a language 
like Glosa, in which a single word can be used as different parts of speech, a 
rigid syntax was necessary.  Hence his use of verboids.  But verboids have 
largely gone by the wayside, and now Glosa can extremely difficult for beginners 
like me to parse.

Perhaps some system of marking words for their roles in the sentence would help, 
for example the German convention of capitalizing nouns.

Anyway, this list and Glosa are moribund. And we

Hey,

Windows is only vulnerable to viruses if you don't have an anti-virus
program.

Anyway, the virus was probably not sent from the email it says it's from.
What the Klez virus and its variants does is to select an email address from
the infected computer's files and uses that as the from address.

But what it does mean is that someone who is on the glosalist list is
infected. Symantec has a free on-line virus-scanner at
http://security.symantec.com/ using Norton anti-virus. Also the Downloads
link has free downloads of removal tools. Go use it if you think your
computer is infected. (if you don't have an anti-virus program, it probably
is).

Best wishes,
Anthony

Attention! VIRUS!!!

Another attack ... 

Please do not open the files, which has been attached to the

It is infected with the virus W32/Klez.H{at}mm{dot}

Not me either. I have Norton anti-virus, my ISP has the Brightmail virus
scanner and all my outgoing email is virus-scanned.

BTW I got the books and am now going to learn Glosa. 1,000 words shouldn't
be too difficult. What I'm wondering is what is "pen pal" in Glosa? Pen pal
translates as stilo ami. But probably the European version of pen pal, mail
friend, translated to posta ami is more accurate.

But what's email? eposta?

Best wishes,
Anthony

For those still remaining, who haven't noticed the pattern,
but might like to get the spammer kicked out by his ISP,
here are the incriminating header lines for the last 6 msgs:

Message-Id: <200303252309.h2PN9Q102356{at}alpha{dot}esper{dot}com>

Message-Id: <200303270120.h2R1KPD30716{at}alpha{dot}esper{dot}com>

This list has been demolished by spammers and flamers.
What's needed is a *moderated* email list with enough
active participants to maintain real discussions.
But there's no point in beating a dead horse ...

So the spammer seems to be customer of www.esper.com.  Yesterday I
received a kind e-mail from Mr. Richard Queener, who has got an
esper.com e-mail address and who seems to be also a glosalist-member.
Perhaps this is a little chance:


Dear Richard,

As you may know, glosalist, the mailing list for Glosa, is overspammed
at the moment.  Origin of some of these mails is the provider
esper.com, which is also your ISP.  Please be so kind and make a
virus check on your computer.  Please find out, whether your PC is
infected with the Klez-virus.  That would be in your interest.  Please
tell your results to the group glosalist{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au .

Good anti-virus software is freely available on the internet.  I
personally use F-prot from www.f-prot.com .

Thanks in advance e saluta

Marcel

Karo pe; qi es ci a-nu,

Because of the spam and virus attacks in glosalist, I tried to learn
more about mailing lists the last days.  Here some lines about it:

The EZMLM-program, that runs glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au,
(manual: www.ezmlm.org/ezman-0.32/ ) is available in two versions: the
simple EZMLM and the more functional EZMLM-IDX, which allows
moderating.  That would be the easiest solution for us, if the
list-owner (Robin) would moderate glosalist or if he would set in a
co-moderator.  (I just sent this letter also to Robin and to
glosalist-owner{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au ).


Another thing: I tested 3 mailing-list providers:
  http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist , glosalist{at}yahoogroups{dot}com
  http://uk.domeus.com , "glosa-forum",     glosa-forum{at}domeus{dot}co{dot}uk
  http://www.kbx7.de , "glosa-forum",       glosa-forum{at}kbx7{dot}de

If you feel like it, you can play with them: subscribe, send a test
mail, receive it again and unsubscribe.  These groups are not
moderated yet, but all of them offer the possibility to do so.  My
impression: yahoo is the best of them (switch the option "Do not
convert to HTML"!).  Two things I dislike:

 * I tried to forward the messages of the old glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au
   into these new forums, but that does not work.  All of them filter
   the EZMLM-postings out.  That is sad, because when we would change
   over to a new provider, the Glosa community would be splitted.
   Some will remain in the old system, some will leave Glosa
   completely.

 * The old glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au is advert free - though it is attacked
   by viruses and spam mails.  The companys above allow to moderate
   and to sort out the bad mails, but they get their money from
   adverts attached to the mails, what we would have to accept then.

Other possibilities:
www.yourmailinglistprovider.com , advert free, but only one mail per
  day, or more mails per day and then 2.50 EURO/month.
www.jpberlin.de , a "political provider", perhaps not expensive,
  on vacations at the moment.
www.listserv.dfn.de free and no adverts, but only for scientist who are
  member of DFN.
Some universities, ... but only when you are student or staff there.


I think, the situation in glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au is not acceptable any
longer and we have to act.  I would say: change over to yahoo is better
than staying here.  Please tell me, what your opinion is.

Nuli-tem despera, saluta

Marcel

Oops, that was not correct(?).  I just received my mail back from Kbx7.
( http://www.kbx7.de , "glosa-forum", glosa-forum{at}kbx7{dot}de ).  But I
did not get double mails of Nick and Walter from Kbx7, -- strange.
Unfortunately Kbx7 attaches not only advert-footers but also
advert-headers to the mails.

Please let us discuss what to do.  Gratia pre e saluta - Marcel.

Good work Marcel.. Thank you.
I agree that a change to yahoo! is a very good idea.  I say, do it!

Agreed. I'm subscribed to 50 or so lists on Yahoo, have most
set to no-mail (website only), the remainder set to mail digests
(no HTML, right!), and, naturally, only have enough time to
actually participate in a very few.

If you avoid the website, reading as email (especially digested),
the adverts aren't very obtrusive at all. It works very well.
Maintains the archives too, and in an easily searchable fashion!

The problem here is not the software, it's lack of administration.
Anybody can maintain a newsletter using any plain email program.
So the real question is WHO, not WHERE. And then, unless he is
willing to filter out Jay-style flames, it still won't work.

Ok, hmmm. Everyone is agreed that the present glosalist is no good at all.
But any change must be regarded in terms of what is lost and what is gained.

Personally, I think a change to a Yahoo! group is an excellent idea. What we
lose is the discussion list where we can send an email to all members on the
mailing list. But what we gain is a discussion group with web-based
discussions (although Yahoo! provides members with the ability to receive
discussions by email and [I think] to post messages by email. Also what we
gain is the ability to promote the group to Internet users and possibly to
bring in new members.

I think it should be done, and fast, because my anti-virus program is on
overdrive at the moment!

But, just a thought, let's consider those amongst us (me) who are fledgling
Glosa speakers and not yet confident to post in un Glosa lingua. So let's
allow English in the new group.

Anthony

Karo John, Bill, Charles e Anthony.  Gratia de vi grama!

Charles grafo, 2003-03-29:

Yes, you are right, that is another possibility.  But the solution on
one's own PC is only good, when he has very long online-time or better
a 24-hour-server without vacations.  Otherwise a direct discussion -
like we rarely had also on glosalist - is not possible, when the
list-owner switches off his PC and goes to bed.

I see obvious differences between the mailing-list providers and
between the different software-solutions.  When we start new, why not
take the best one?  But you are right, our virus attacks do not
belong to the EZMLM-program or Zeta.org.


 > So the real question is WHO, not WHERE.

It is all the same to me, WHO.  My first choice would be, Robin would
moderate the existing list.  My second, anybody else would moderate a
new mailing-list, perhaps someone, who can start an advert-free
list.  My third, if nobody feels like doing it, take the yahoo-group I
started ( http://groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist ,
glosalist{at}yahoogroups{dot}com ).  With the simple option "No attachments"
we can solve the virus-problem very easily without any work of
moderation.

I just do not like the situation of glosalist, that could easily be

Jay has followed me (and others) from list to list, sabotaging
every one with his personal verbal attacks. He is a mini-terrorist.
Most people fear to engage in discussion with him, but I don't.
Bystanders like you sometimes mistake victim for perpetrator.
I'm real tired of that, too. But don't worry, I have no intention
of joining your new list anyway, because I lost any hope for Glosa
once Wendy reasserted control and involvement, such as it is.

Assuming that I haven't misunderstood, I'll have to disagree.
A Yahoo! group can be used exactly like our current listserver.
If you join by sending an email to the group, you can use it
just like a regular mailing list and you never have to go to
the website. If instead you choose to use the website (in which
case you'll have to register (it's free)), you can still use
it just like a regular mailing list, or turn off the mail and
just read and post online, or both, search the archives, etc.
There is also a files area for each group where we could store
dictionaries and samples and such.

For example, concerning those many lists I've subscribed: the
ones in which I'm most active and/or interested I receive as
emails or email digests, while for the others I've disabled
the email and just pop into the website occasionally to see
what's new.

Over the past few years Yahoo! has absorbed several other list
servers, some of which had themselves absorbed others, such as
OneList, eGroups, etc. That's how I ended up on so many Yahoo!
lists! Whether that's good or bad I don't really have an opinion,
but in truth it works as well as did the other smaller ones.

One advantage to Yahoo! is that it is large and well-known. People
would be more likely to find glosalist while searching for lists by
keywords such as glosa or interglossa or international language.
If we mentioned Greek and Latin and Esperanto we'd be even more
likely to attract some new members.

It is possible to have multiple moderators on a Yahoo! list. Some
lists choose several moderators located around the world to increase
the probability that one will be awake and ready to moderate at any
given time.

Salata,
Bill

... it sounded like you were interested in a new email list.

Well, I wish you luck with Glosa. A new list can only help.
Especially if new members can feel safe to post without
getting insulted, so they'll participate instead of lurking.
But my own interests have drifted elsewhere.

Marcel,
This is uncalled for, I see my name is again 
badmouthed on this list and I really wish
this be stopped. I've not used vulgarities,
which Charles has, I've not insulted others
as Charles has, I've not put down Glosa
as Charles has. I've supported Glosa
for a number of years, I've put up info
on it on the web when there was little
of it, I was one of the first folks to join
this list. Now please, I am not happy 
that the person who has abused my 
name time and again remains on this
list. I've sent a request to unsubscribe
and received no confirmation as of yet.

I'm virus free thanks to my anti-virus
program, which automatically deletes
any messages which it flags as infected.
I also filter out anything coming from
Charles and it ends up where it belongs,
in the trash bin.

Now, I'm requesting that Robin unsubscribe
me from this list if Charles is to continue on
it. He's shown time and again he's not interested
in the promotion of Glosa and only demeans
the language and those who use it. Robin,
should make a decision. Mine is already 
made.

Sincerely
Jay B.

Hi,

Unfortunately, you cut out my little bit on the ability to send and receive
messages by email. All you've done is to expand on it, and very greatly.
Same with my bit on the ability to promote glosalist to other Internet users
through Yahoo! groups. But I don't mind plagiarism if it does some good.

But we do lose the ability to send email to all members of the list, i.e. to
those who have chosen to not receive posts by email. For those, we depend on
them going to the group web page and reading the messages, if they don't
lose interest or forget about it.

But a Yahoo! group is a good idea and I'll be joining.

Anthony

Dear Jay and Charles,

Jay wrote,

I am really sorry about that.  My comment was stupid and I really
want to apologize for it.

You both have much in common:  you both love auxlangs, you both have
helped Glosa, you both have another favourite auxlang than Glosa, and
- that is sad, but seems unchangeable - you both hate each other.  I
think, all that is okay.

With my silly joke ("jayandcharles{at}yahoogroups{dot}com") I just wanted to
say, that I cannot understand, why grown-up people who hate each other
cannot communicate directly without misusing a public mailing-list for
it.  Or better, why don't they simply avoid each other?  Again: sorry
for it.  I did not want to offend any of you both.  War-time and
hate-time is not joke-time, we do not need awkward jokes but
understanding, peace and love.  And for that we need a world language
for better communication very quickly!

I ask both of you, please stop it.  I would be very happy, if noone of
you will answer this letter with explanations, that the other is the
"perpetrator" and so on.

Glosalist has problems enough:  If we stay at zeta.org, we will loose
members by virus attacks.  If we change over to another provider, we
will loose members, because not everyone feels like passing a new
register procedure.  Glosa will lose anyway.  Please do not make it
worse.

I now have started to forward manually all mails of
glosalist{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au to yahoo.  So if you read
groups.yahoo.com/group/glosalist you will be virus-free, you will not
miss a message, but you will have a delay.

Sad, that the new archive started with personal attacks already.

Saluta - Marcel

Plagiarism. Sheesh. Newbies. Sheesh. Top-posters. Sheesh!

Ah, well, see, I did preface my comments with "Assuming that I haven't
misunderstood". That was your cue to clarify, and to politely correct me
if I was in the wrong. Apparently I did misunderstand; your argument is
that we would lose the guarantee that all who are subscribed will receive
the email messages. True. A bit of expansion would have been helpful there,
eh? Your statement was poorly written and unclear.

Building upon your thought (gee, am I plagiarizing again?) this means that
with Yahoo! they will be less likely to unsubscribe, since they have the
option of disabling email and only checking in when they feel like it.

Hmm. Besides the frequently arriving virus, I'm now hit with childishness
and personal attack. Perhaps it's time to leave.

Salata,
Bill

Sheesh and furrfu and sheesh again! In the brief time that it took
