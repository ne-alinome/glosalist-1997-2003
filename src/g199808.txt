*   The Cobuild approach is 'descriptive', whereas other dictionaries are
'prosriptive', telling us how we ought to use the language.  School
teachers prefer the latter, which uses th older authoritarian paradigm.

*    Taking the 'forti' example, I agree with Paul Bartlett's thought of
eliminating synonyms .. at least for beginners!

*    I prefer not to think of playing games with the synonyms, especially
imagining infixes to the Glosa words: I doubt that we can find any way of
warping "vis" to "robora" to "forti", even non-seriously after a long day
at work.  Have you suffered the Linguistic variety of "snow-blondness",
called "word-blindness" as a result of spending too long over the Glosa
word-lists?

     The antidote to word-blindness is writing letters in Glosa to
Africans.  In time, as I get permission from the Africans, I will publish
contact details of such antidotes on this list.

Saluta,
