    My apology if some of my comments on version 1.3 of Robin's
Glosa grammar description seemed too strong.  There are certain
matters that I do have strong opinions on, and I may have
phrased myself inappropriately.  However, I would like to see
the most effective presentation for Glosa in whatever that form
takes.  The better the presentation the more likely it is that
other people may become interested.

Strong criticism intended to help improve Glosa
cannot be bad ... It is better to solve problems
at the beginning, and it looks like Glosa will
be making a new beginning soon.

I do think that a rigorous modern grammar like
that of Rick Morneau will be needed, as it exposes
all problems from the start, so a complete grammar
will never need to be patched in the future.

It is also easier to specify a minimal set of rules
in B-N notation, understandable to all students of
linguists and computer science, than any other way.

    A new beginning in what sense?  This might almost risk a schism in
what little Glosa movement there is.

    Although it is based on minimal evidence, my suspicion is that Ron
Clark and Wendy Ashby would have nothing to do with anything like this.
I for one still do not know their position on anything going on about
Glosa on the 'net and what they might intend to do about if if they
disagree.  However, along the lines of a couple of my posts in reply to
James Chandler on AUXLANG, I do not think that "scientific design" is
the only thing to consider.  Although he was a polyglot, Zamenhof was
not a professional linguist, and like it or not, Esperanto has been
beating the pants off all competitors for a century.  So much for
"scientific design."  I think some things can be determined
empirically.

    I worked professionally with computers for years, and B-N notation
is rather opaque to me.  My experience was -practical-, not
theoretical.  I am concerned with what works, not theoretical elegance.

Call it a new awakening, then. Or whatever.

It won't contradict them, they won't argue.
I don't really much care what they think anyway.

I do not contemplate any new design at all.
I suggest a rational, transparent analysis of
what already is there, at least in Robin's head.

That is what I call science.

B-N is practical; please read the URL specified earlier.
RM gives a partial B-N for English, to serve as a start.

I am suggesting that Robin's grammar as written is
not sufficient, whereas B-N is; but only Robin seems
to have the intuition of how Glosa really is.

     The Burd paper does nothing to stop me from continuing to use the

"Royal capital" when describing "linguists" as 'Linguists.'

     Linguists are very intelligent - no disputing that: are they using
this intelligence to delude others with their seeming superiority of
intellect; or are they deluding themselves with the sound of their own
terminology?

**   Well, on my second run through Burd's paper, I started to get the
gist.  He does differentiate between the syntactical distinctions made
within some languages (marking Head & dependent lexemes differently)

and semantic distinctions within languages (marking Predicate & object
lexemes differently) and does suggest that there is a matrix that shows
different combinations of these parameters among the different
natlangs.

     Burd does mention clauses acting as linguistic units equivalent to
individual words, and he does mention, only briefly, the concept of
"modifiers", but restricts following discussion solely to adjectives.


     He gives one nice example of VBP-speak (Very Bright Person) :-

   "noun: a lexical item representing a semantic object (saturated
predicate) which is without further modification a syntactic actant."


     Before commenting on this work, and revealing Glosa's place in the
grand sceme of things, I would - for non-VBP's - rewrite Burd's matix to
make it immediately understandable to the non-Linguists on Glosalist:-


      Semantic -----> Predicate/object sensetive

 Syntactic         +---------------------+--------------------+

 |                 |       Yes           |       No           |

             | No  | Salish,Chin. (V=Adj)|Tong.,Mund.(V=N=Adj)|

             |     |  N, V/Adj marked    |   None marked      |

             +-----+---------------------+--------------------+


 [I hope this formatting comes across on your screen; otherwise,

   I will repost
with~all~whitespace~filled.]<color><param>0000,ffff,0000</param>
~~~~~~

</color>

   So, as was stated, all along, Glosa is in the fourth category with

Tongan and Mundari, where the Parts-of-Speech (Verb, Noun, Adjective
forms of a concept) have the same lexeme.


   What Burd has done is to alert us to the dichotomy in linguistic
understanding, between the syntactic analysis - based on word
positioning, and the semantic analysis - based on the meaning that is
being conveyed.

   However, Burd has used the terms, "verb", "noun" and "adjective"
throughout his paper as if these are solid objects.  Surely, he should
have differentiated between words which were recognisable "nouns", etc,
and those lexemes that were functioning, in the particular instance, as
"nouns", etc.


   In the type-4 languages, words are NOT "verbs", "nouns" or
"adjectives", but can function -- without changing their physical form --

as either "verbs", nouns" or "adjectives" depending on the intention of
the utterer, and the way in which this person has followed the rules of
grammar of the particular type-4 language they are using - to ensure that
the particular function they intended, is the one that is understood by
the reciever of the communication.


   While I cannot vouch for Tongan, Mundari or Tagalog, which are most
likely full of special usages that adulterate the rule of no
morphological changes for different Parts-of-Speech, I can say
categorically that this type-4 rule is a foundation stone of Glosa, and
is observed in its use.  Hogben did fvour the type-1 situation in
Interglossa, but stressed the "Concept Language" quality of his creation.


   Clark and Ashby maintain the 'Concept Language' feature, but realise
that the marking of Parts-of-Speech is redundant when Syntax-based
Grammar is applied.  EG kurso [run, runs, ran, running, to run]  This
concept-word covers the concept of *running*, and can be used, within
reason - and observing the laws of syntax - as any part of speech.


 An kurso ad u boteka.  [He runs to the shop.]


 Plu ju-an kurso a sko-do.  [The boys run to school.]


 Tem kurso to u parka, an pa kade.  [While running at the park, he
fell.]


 Te ariva pre Okta Hora fe nece kurso fo celero.  [To arrive before Eight
   O'Clock, she must run very quickly.]


 Pre exercisa, mi fu vesti-auto intra kurso-vesti.  [ Before exercising,
I will clothe myself in (put on) running clothes.]


 Mi vo kurso la; ka mi vo gene sani.  [I want to run there, because I
want to get healthy (fit).]


 Akti id kurso.  [Do it running.]


 Mu pa gene lose in u celero-kurso fluvi.  [They were lost in the
fast-running river.


 An pa tende kurso a mi, sed mi dice ad an: greso.  [He intended to run
to me, but I told him to walk.]


   Thus, I have categorised Glosa, and have given exaples of Glosa
sentences demonstrating that it is, in fact, a type-4 languge.

   An now I would go beyond Burd's conclusion to say that that type-4
languages comprise unmarked lexemes, not Parts-of-Speech.  It iswrong to
say that, in Glosa, the Verb is equivalent to the Noun, and that both are
equivalent to the Adjective: this puts the ^boot on the wrong foot^.  In
reality the concept-word, for a particular abstract idea, can function as
one of the different Parts-of-Speech: in use, the fact that the lexeme is
"functioning as" a particular Part-of-Speech, and NOT that part of
speech, should be indicated.

   While each sentence has its Verb Phrase (VP) and Noun Phrases (NP),
and we can talk of the Verb and Predicate in the abstract, when it gets
down to specific lexemes, I would strongly recommend using notation to
show that the lexeme's function in the particular sentence is
transitory.

To achieve this I have used the single parenthesis:

  'verb' = lexeme functioning as a verb

  'noun' = lexeme functioning as a noun

  'adjective' = lexeme functioning as an adjective

  'adverb' = lexeme functioning as an adverb


    Briefly, the open class of words in Glosa (or substantives) can
function as verbs, nouns or modifiers.  The modifier category covers both
'adjectives' and 'adverbs'.  With Head Final structure in both Noun
Phrases and Verb Phrases, modifier(s) are paced before the substantive
word, whether it be 'noun' or 'verb'.

Well, this is a technical paper intended for specialists,
but it isn't beyond reach of the interested amateur.
The idea of the 4-way split is apparently original with him,
and from reading his other papers, he is the anti-thesis of
an ivory-towerist or capitalist henchman ...

The key phrase is his "without further modification".
Every language has ways of turning verb into noun,
or using a word usually of one class as another --
that is the "further modification". So "WFM" is really
a cute way of thumbing his nose at terminology ...

I see no difference. Things are whatever they are,
but we call them by names that really are quite arbitrary.

Glosa uses word order as the only means of indicating word class.
Glosa is head-last within a phrase. Particles (or pronouns,
or prepositions) mark the beginning of a phrase. Hyphenation
is used to disambiguate within a phrase. Is that correct?

The lexeme isn't going to be a problem once you decide
there is no morphology and the head comes last.
The only difficulty is finding the phrase boundaries.
Small word-particles like "u" and "pa" and "ad" work fine,
as in Chinese and as in Hogben's original idea (I think).

In the dictionary project, it might be wise to keep in
mind that particles should be small (1 or 2 letters)
and regular words a bit larger; "trans" isn't so good
as a preposition and I would avoid it, using a verb
like "crossing" instead. It makes reading much easier,
and makes the clunky ";" and ":" dispensable.

No disagreement on that, it is similar to standard pidgin.

    I would specify, rather, that marker particles be a single
syllable when practical, regardless of how many letters it
takes to spell them.  And I'm not sure I quite understand the
objection to 'trans.' At least part of the idea of Glosa
vocabulary is to use words which are a modicum of somewhat
recognizable from Greco-Latin roots.  'Trans' fits into this
category, I would say.  The book "18 Steps to Fluency in
Euro-Glosa" (an infelicitous name) has a useful diagram
illustrating spacial prepositions (and a few modifiers),
and 'trans' seems no worse to me than any of the others.

    My intention, at least, is not to reinvent the language
but only to clarify a few things from exsting materials,
standardize the vocabulary, and improve the presentation.

For experimental purposes, I would suggest simply
marking head words with a harmless apostrophe"'".
Colors don't come through in email, though they
would on a web page; there, bolding works better.

Maybe the ticks indicate the true phrase boundaries,

actually the term is "prosody" or some such.

    Suppose I wanted to write out Thursday, 7 January 1999.

Thursday: di penta

7 January: di septi, meno mo

How can we distinguish 'di X' as a day of the week and 'di X' as a date
within a month?

    There is also the question of distinguishing "after three hours"
and "after three o'clock" (this problem arises with other languages as
well).  If it is now one o'clock, "after three hours" = 'po tri horo'
indicates the same as "after four o'clock," definitely not the same as
"after three o'clock."  'Po tri horo' thus is ambiguous.

Too long for a particle; prepositions are particles AFAIK.
Conversely, some lexical items are too short,
and can look like particles, e.g. "ala" vs. "ali".
Prepositions are inherently ideosyncratic, and
known to be treacherous for new (L2) learners.
All lexicals (any that are added) should be approx 4 or 5
letters long, to avoid such confusions; also, ideally
they should be CVCV style to fit the overall phonology.

In meaning? It think it ought to go back to being a
well-behaved verb, in all auxlangs. Most of the Oriental
languages do not use "across" as Indo-European does.
Other than for indirect objects and genitives,
why use prepositions at all? I would have thought
infinitives require one, but Robin just uses them raw.

    True.  But several Glosa prepositions are bisyllabic.  Come to
think of it, I might retract the remark that particles should all
be monosyllables when possible.  Again, there is -- or at least is
supposed to be -- an element of mnemonicity in the Glosa vocabulary
which might take some precedence over other considerations.

    I for one, at least, do not see it as my task to rebuild Glosa
from the ground up.  As much as possible I am trying to work within
the language as it already is.  I am not trying to make a new
pseudo-Glosa.  (I already did one exercise in language rebuilding
with frater2, although I never finished the vocabulary.)

My remarks about prepositions were directed toward
*new* vocabulary *additions*.

My remarks about syntax were directed toward
*clear* specification of *existing* language.

    I am trying to avoid additions insofar as possible, merely working

    I am not sure that we have a disagreement here as such.  Perhaps a
difference of opinion as to the most effective way to accomplish this.

    It may well be a misunderstanding on my part, but I almost got
the impression somehow that you were trying (or at least willing) to
rebuild Glosa into something else (in which case it would not longer
be Glosa).  Please correct me if my impression is erroneous.

You will hereby be corrected in full ...

I see Glosa as incomplete in several areas,
yet basically in design it is simply a pidgin,
which gives very little leeway for creativity:

Phonology: mostly CV syllables.
Morphology: none to speak of.
Syntax: subject-verb-object, adjective-noun.
Lexicon: simplified Latin and Greek roots.

Hogben's original idea is still maybe 40% present.
I had read about it 20 years ago, and was quite
disappointed recently, to see its current state.
However, it is the only pidgin/creole type artificial
language having some significant amount of good
publicity, and that could be the way to go for an
international auxiliary language.

The flaws of Glosa are probably correctable,
and I see some efforts here to do so. But,
the competition (Euroclones and some natlangs)
is strong, so a half-hearted effort will *not*
be sufficient ... Glosa would die. If it can't be
simpler and in some senses better than natlangs,
then it isn't worth the effort.

On the other hand, I do have conlang interests
as well, and am quite unafraid to wade through
the technical literature in search of better
understanding of language. Also, I like parts
of Ido and other IALs, and would like to see
any of them either reform themselves technically
or become more popular or both. On this list
I am only concerned with pushing Glosa away
from hobby status, and toward real usefulness.

I would appreciate never having to speak of
my motives or intentions again. Please
criticize only ideas, not persons.

    It was not my intention to criticize you personally.  If
that is what came across, I apologize for the erroneous
impression.  I was responding to what I thought might be your

    But I have crossed the line, on occasion, when describing the Hard and
Soft varieties of Glosa.  Ron Clark terms it 'telegramatic' or
'vernacualar' Glosa, and Paul dislikes unnecessary redundancy in the use of
particles; I believe that there is a base-lined 'verbose' Glosa, which
includes all markers - mainly for learning purposes - and which can be
vernacularised, progressively, by the learner as he/she gains
fluency.  However, I have never imagined that the Hard and Soft versions of
Glosa are different dialects.

Saluta,

mathematical, formal logic, approach to communication, and am not good at
imposing other systems of grammar "retrospectively" onto Glosa.

 </bold>Hello Friends,

  Here I Attach the completed WORK.FIL of Glosa words matching the
original list from Bill Patterson.

  A large part of the "missing" words had their equivalent members in the
Glosa dictionary before we commenced this work.

  For several words, I included an alternative Glosa form: please help
with the selection of one from these pairs.

  Alternatively, various English words got two or three Glosa versions.

Please give your opinion on these multiple listings.


  A few English words did not produce a suitable Glosa word, so I ignored
them.  Many English words got translated into compound forms (located in
the second column); and several of the English words needed new Glosa
words, which I got from the Latin Dictionary (located in the third
column).


 WARNING!WARNING!WARNING!

   The Attached file is very long.  Possibly it will not get through your
system.


   Please inform me of any difficulty with this transfer, and I will seek
an alternative mode of sending it to you.

   Please hold onto this file of words "missing" from the "Glosa 6000"
list, but note, few of the words in this new list will get into the new
abbreviated "2.5K Glosa" dictionary

 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&

P.S. I hope this is not too long for the Internet.  Now, while I'm in the
mood, I ought to start looking at a reduction of the 6000 list down to a
target of 2000.

Based on Glosa's official type-4 adjective class
(this is not official linguistic terminology)
there must be relative clauses; so that "that"
that was mentioned needs to be kept around ...
The innovative part, IIUC, is that there are
different "that"s for adjectival versus adberbial
clauses (???). This needs some clarification.
I didn't even mention resumptive pronouns yet.

At some point the grammar must specify how
to attach phrases unambiguously to avoid
(or encourage?) the infamous "I saw a
man running after the cat with a broom
in underwear" sort of thing.

That is entirely reasonable, and many languages do
exactly that; just say Glosa is very "pro-drop"
(elides whenever the speaker feels like it)
and then everybody is happy.

    "That" even as a conjunctive in English has more than one usage.
I might be able to live with some usage or another in Glosa, but it
most definitely needs to be specified which "that" is being used, and
if necessary use more than one construct.  Some Glosa correspondent to
the English "that" introducing a substantive clause is how I
interpreted the original 'ke' in Glosa.

    Such a use is entirely different from the "that" in "It was so cold
that the old man died," in which "that" is a different conjunctive
introducing result, consequence, or purpose (as may be).  I proposed in
one example using 'seqe-co' for the latter "that."  Let us please not
import into Glosa the overloading of grammatical function words that
occurs in English or some other natlangs.  Such an overloading just
introduces confusion and ambiguity.  We must definitely try vigorously
to avoid being misled by our mother tongues.

*   Not at all.  The distinction remains ... by ^rule of thumb^ if you can photocopy something, page by page, then it can be copyrighted; if the thing is unique every time - like spoken language - then it is beyond the rules of copyright.  The Authors have vested ownership of the dictionaries and other Glosa printed materials in a corporate body, the GEO.

    In theory, working through a "charity" structure gives the authors considerable advantage .. in England .. over operation as individuals or as a private, tax-paying company.  In the UK, it also confers considerable 'status'.  Of course, all of this 'charity' stuff is now somewhat upstaged by the Internet!

*   I disagree.  No-one can copyright English, and the Glosa authors cannot copyright their social invention, Glosa.  But every English-language dictionary is copyrighted, just as the Glosa dictionaries are also copyright.

    There is NO thought of the authors taking me - or the Glosalist subscribership - to court on account of a _Glosa Few-thousand_ being produced mainly from their 1000 and 6000 lists.

 . It would be counterproductive for Glosa dissemination.

 . The authors would not have the money to wage a legal battle.

    When I see the English sentence, I can think about it and do a
rendition into Glosa.

*   This one is obvious:-

 "I saw a man .. in underwear .. with a broom .. running after a cat."

  The trio of phrases comprise one complex Adjectival Clause:
 " who was wearing underwear, holding a broom, and running after a cat."

And there probably is a heirarchy operating here ... with an increasing
order of significance as the sentence progresses:-
 wearing 'underwear' is an assumed - we all do it;
 but 'with a broom' starts us wondering - what is he going to do with it;
 and when we get to the 'cat' - we have our resolution.

If I put some time into it, I could find the basis of this heirarchy.

The fundamental characteristic is the 'knock-on effect': what happens first
impacts on the next, and so on, with things ^snowballing^ as the sentence
builds up.  The Glosa authors expressed it, in relation to the sequence of
words, as "a word is influenced by it's precedent".  Maybe the same applies
with the larger chunks of the sentence, too.

   Are we going to chase the cat with a broom, while standing in our
underwear, or be in underwear, holding a broom, while chasing a cat?
I believe that the risiing plane of intensity is the more dramatic, and the
way to go.

    Perhaps some melding of meaning can occur within Glosa.  It is my
understanding that Glosa does not - in all possible cases - split hairs.
    If you can list and label the various "That"s as you see them, then we
could all think about these possible differentiations of usage.

*   The WORK.FIL is simply a "working file", like a 'work in progress'
following from Bill Patterson's publishing last year a list of
English-language words for which he could not find equivalents in the Glosa
6000 list.  I laboriously checked through the seemingly omitted words
tracking them down in the current Glosa dictionaries .. or, if they were
not represented there, I created a compound of existing Glosa words ..
while in some rare cases, I used the Latin dictionary to "coin" Glosa words.

   I suspect that all this means the Glosa authors let few concepts through
their net, and most of the omitted words could readily be fixed up with
Glosa equivalents.  Thus very few wordsneed to be conscripted from this
"omitted" list to be included in a Net dictionary.  A small number of
serious omissions come to mind, for which it seemed new Glosa words would
be needed, such as ~utor~ [employ], ~job~ rather than ~ergo~ [job], and
~   ~ [statement].

   From the above, I gather that the long attachment did come through.  I
intend to test the system even more with the entire Eng-Glo_2.5K file, next.

   Please check out the new words and the compounds .. for your agreement.
You might also check over the single words I gave as Glosa translations of
the 'missing' English words.

advertisement - PUBLIKO was suggested. My files say that PUBLIKO =

   ADVERTI or ADVERTI-something. I prefer simply ADVERTI.

annul - KANCELA was suggested but KANCELA = "lattice". Suggestions?

beginning - PROTO and KOMENCE were suggested. I prefer KOMENCE because
   it meshes better with the other definitions of the words. There is
   also Glosa RUDIMENTA = "beginnings". If we consider "beginning" and
   "beginnings" to be close enough in meaning, we could use it.

belong - HABITA was suggested. According to my files, HABITA = "dwell"
   or "inhabit". The old finalvowel problem again? Although I could
   almost make a case for this. Anyway, how about PERTINE which is
   already in the dictionary? ("Belong" should not have been in the
   omissions list. I think it got there through a programming or data
   formatting error.)

camera - FOTO-GRAFI KAMERA was suggested, but KAMERA = "room". How about
   just FOTO-GRAFI-ME?

discovery - DETEKTI was suggested, but since HEURESI = "discover", why
   don't we use it instead?

Adding to Robin's comments that I just read... I took your Basic
Vocabulary, removed some things that wouldn't apply in Glosa, and
then compared it with the full Glosa dictionary to look for missing
words, thus generating the omissions list. Naturally, I neglected to
remove some of the inapplicable Basic words, so there are some words
on the omissions list that should not be there. For example, words
in Glosa that are formed via generics, and English spelling differences
between the two files, British vs. American, that sort of thing.

The original omissions list is at

It would be wise to peruse the entire list of Esperanto
suffixes, Interlingua's too; because we must be able to
translate them somehow. Eo's are more ingenious and,
as we say, "orthogonal"; Ia's are the Standard Average
European derivational series.

Who was the who? This is really a nasty example, that starts
out easy then becomes impossible. In many langs, disambiguating
the referents "cat" and "person" is easy because there are
inanimate vs. animate pronouns, "it" vs. "him/her"; not an
appropriate solution in Glosa tho.

I don't think that works, because I've never heard of that

Though it uses phrases, the better way might be to re-cast as
participles or clauses; then we get into how to clearly mark
dependent clauses like in Morneau's "Syntax" article.

"I, dressed in underwear, saw a man running down the street
carrying a broom and pursuing a cat".

My strategy is to replace treacherous prepositions with verbs,
place adverbial phrases adjacent to their verbs, and separate
the rest with pauses noted by commas or semicolons.

Use of resumptive pronouns as in Persian might be a good idea.
It is already established that Glosa will be the type of lang
that uses relative clauses, unlike Chinese and Turkish which
have a way to dispense with them (with other drawbacks).
True pidgins also dispense with RC's, but Glosa aims higher.

    "That" has various uses in English.  Two are those of demonstrative
pronoun and adjective.  I am not concerned with such uses here, as
there does not seem to be a great problem in Glosa with such.  However,
as a conjunction and a relative pronoun, "that" has numerous uses which
are not at all the same.  Such confusion should most definitely NOT be
smuggled into a constructed auxlang.

    For instance, "that" can introduce a substantive (or noun)
subordinate clause: 'He said that he was afraid.'  'that he was afraid'
is a substantive clause which is the direct object of "said."

    As a relative pronoun, "that" can introduce an adjectival
subordinate clause: 'This is the house that Jack built.'  Even in
English, one could here often substitute "which" for "that," but
nevertheless the "that" construction is legal and occurs.

    In my former example, "that" introduces an adverbial subordinate
clause: "It was so cold that the old man died."

    "That" can even be used to introduce an optative construction: "Oh,
that he might come!"

    My desk dictionary lists numerous refinements of "that" being used
to introduce various kinds of noun, adjectival, and adverbial clauses.
To try to collapse all of this morass of English usage into a similarly
overloaded single word in Glosa is folly, in my opinion.  There may be
the danger of trying to smuggle the entire apparatus of English clause
structure into Glosa, giving further credence to the charge that Glosa
is little more than recoded English -- in which case, why not junk
Glosa, ask people to expend a little more effort to learn English, and
use English as the global auxiliary language (which it now nearly is,
anyway)?

Robin did those. I believe that...

"Found in GEO" means, as you said, that Robin found them; so from the
point of view of the GEO they weren't really omissions, I just didn't
have them! The "Suggested" column contains either words that already
exist and are similar in meaning to the omission, or words that can
be created by compounding words that exist. And "New Forms" consists
of brand new words taken from Latin or Greek.

That should have been "quasi-perfective," NOT "quasi-imperfective."

putrid - We have SAPRO (decay, rot). That could also serve for "putrid".

exclusive - We have EXKLUDE (exclude) and could use it for this too.

acknowledge - How about REKOGNI (recognize)?

brass - CUPRI-ZINK was suggested, but we have KUPRA (copper), so KUPRA-ZINK?

afternoon - Since noon is MESO-DI (noon), how about PO-MESO-DI?

compound - KOMPOSITO (composite) could handle this meaning too.

dictionary - VERBI-BIBLI is good for the preferred word, since it
   compounds two Glosa roots. We also have LEXIKO and LEXIKON. I don't
   think we need DIKTIONARIA in addition to those three... hmmm... I
   *do* like the looks of it... okay, let's add it, for the literary
   dictionary! But I do think VERBI-BIBLI should be preferred.

Date: Tue, 12 Jan 99 23:2


label - I have NOMINA but not NIMA; how about NOMINA-BILETA?

likely - Rather than POSI (perhaps), how about PROBABILI (probable)?
   Seems more positive to me.

pride - TARQINI (haughty, proud). That one even *looks* proud to me!

proposal - PROPOSI (propose).

radio - RADIO was suggested, but we have RADIO (ray, spoke).

such - Here we find one of those Glosa oddities. We have U TALI (such -
   from Latin "talis") and TALI (heel - from Latin "talus"). One of
   these needs to be changed! Suggestions? Mine is to use TALU for heel.
   Not only because it retains the original vowel, but also because
   "such" has probably been used more often than "heel" in existing
   literature.

advice  - In my file I find ADVOKA = AD+VOKA (call). Instead, how about
   using KONCILIA (advise) also as a noun?

suggestion - Rather than SUGERE, couldn't we just use SUGESTI (suggest)
   as a noun?

unit - We already have UNITA (trait), so we need something else for "unit".

grateful - We have GRATIA so we don't need GRACE. (Somehow that sounds
   odd.) So, GRATIA-PLE.

jealousy - We have ZELOSO (jealous); could it stand also for "jealousy"?

metric - METRO SISTEMA was suggested, but I prefer METRA SISTEMA or
   METRI SISTEMA, since METRA = "metre" (the system with metres), and
   METRI = "measure" (the system of measures), and METRO = "mother".

mile - We can't use MILE because currently MILE=KILO=thousand.

conscience - AUTO-KRITIKI was suggested. I like that one! Currently we
   have KRITICI=criticize, but I'm not sure whether I prefer the C or K
   at the end. Preference, anybody?

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Wed, 13 Jan 99 21:5


supper - We already have CENA (dinner). It could be used. Or we could add
   KENA, similar but different, more like the Latin, if we want to make
   the distinction.

calculate, calculator - We have SUMA (add,sum,total). We could use this word
   also for calulate, and calulcator could be SUMA-RU. Or SUMA-ME, similar
   to PUTA-ME for computer.

television - TELE-VIDE was suggested, and this reminded me of the "radio"
   question. And German. We have TELEFONA (telephone) (though "sound"
   is FONO; terminal vowels again). "Radio" could be a TELE-(hear,listen).
   Unfortunately, all the appropriate Glosa words begin with a vowel;
   TELE-AUDI, TELE-AKUSTI, TELE-ASKOLTA, and TELE-AUSKULTA seem awkward.
   Actually, TELE-DICE might be more appropriate for Glosa's "telephone",
   and then TELE-FONA could be radio; but that would be a terrible False
   Friend, wouldn't it? SONI is another Glosa word for "sound"; I'm
   thinking of this solution...

      TELEFONA = telephone (or TELEFONO)
      TELESONI = radio
      TELEVIDE = television

Hello,

   I am now trying to promote Glosa through this new Internat journal.

   The first thing I must do, is translate from English into the language
I wish to promote.


   When we research _Babel_ we will possibly decide it is a suitable
publishing location for items from Glosalist subscribers.


   Here, attached to this letter, I send you the test-text, which I
needed to translate into Glosa.  In a following post, I send you my Glosa
version.


   The test-text caused several problems with:-

    . a lot of vernacular language,

    . the use of plurals .. especially with ~vi~ and ~tu~,

    . changing from plural to singular within one sentence, and

    . several incomplete sentences.


   Also, I introduced the "^" marks for non-literal language, and with
various sentences, I changed the sentence structure.


/* Hint: As I did above, I find it a lot easier to write the Glosa first,
then render it into English, than to go the other way. */

centimeter - CENTI-METRI was suggested, but we already have CENTI (hundred)
   and CENTIPEDI (centipede). We need a new word for "hundredth". Or a
   better solution would probably be to use CENTIMETRA, with CENTI=hundredth
   and HEKTO=hundred, as in the Metric System. And then we'd have HEKTOPEDI.
   The downside is that we'd be inconsistent with existing literature.

equitable - Oops! We already have JUSTI (fair (equitable)) and JUSTI (just
   (equitable)), but somehow never defined JUSTI (equitable)!

hemp - SATIVA was suggested, but we have SATIVU (cultivated), which reminded
   me that the "sativa" in "cannabis sativa" means "cultivated". How about
   KANABIS, from Latin "cannabis", instead?

keen - We have ALAKRI (brisk, crisp, eager)? Could we fit "keen" into here?

into two bits: the PAST and the PERFECT.  It is fairly academic, anyway,
since ~pra~ is Old Glosa.  But, from my pragmatic point of view, one
particle beats two.
 . ~du~ = "continues to"
 . ~pa du~ = "continued to" .. more 'continuous' than 'unfinished' to me.

 . There used to be a ~parato~ [already] but that must be O.G. also!
    U kani parato fago mi pedi-ve.
   [the dog (had) already eat(en) my shoe]

 . To separate the functions (Past&Perfect) we could use ~previo~ in the
form, ~pa previo~ = "did previosly", or ~kompleti" [completely] in the form
~pa kompleti~ = "did completely".  And if this makes Glosa easier for
Russians to learn, who am I to make things difficult by wanting to
resurrect the dead ~pra~?
 . How on Earth do the English get away with "had" = ''did completely'',
anyway? EG  "I had done it before lunch."
           [I did completely do it before lunch]
            Mi pra akti id pre meso-vora.  O.G.
            Mi pa kompleti akti id pre meso-vora.  Mod.Glosa
  ... possibly because it is shorter than anything else: ha(ve di)d.

*   ???  When in doubt, use "U".  Just because ~u~ is the 'noun marker'
shouldn't mean that we can't use it to say something like: "Listen buddy,
the next main word you see will be a noun: O.K.?"

*   True, but the Glosa authors have adopted the COUNT/UNCOUNT distinction
from English - probably, again, for good logical reasons - and I am having
trouble identifying the Glosa version of "some" for Countables.  ~u mero
de~ quite happily comes across as "a bit of" OR "some(UNCOUNT)", but I am
racking my brain to for the Glosa way of saying something like, "He bought
some apples."
    ~plura~ will do, but it seems a mouthful, when the situation calls for
a one-syllable word.  I don't like to push the lexicon, but the neatest
solution I can come up with is a derivative of the French `des` [of the].
EG  An pa merca plura pomo. ......  An pa merca des pomo.
    [he did buy several apples]  .. [he did buy some apples]

   In Glosa, there is a range of Determinant-Indicator words that come at
the start of a Noun Phrase:-
 u = (noun), a, the
 plu = (plural Noun), the (plural)
 u-ci = this [the-here]
 plu-ci = these [the(plural) here]
 u-la =that [the there]
 plu-la = those [the(plural) there]
 plura = several
 (u) mero de = some of
 ali = any
 ali de u = any of the
 u holo = the whole
 holo de u = all of the
 poli = many

    And I am still not convinced that Glosa should ape the horrendous
English verb system.  Native speakers may not realize what a true mess
it really is.  A -planned- language can plan away such monstrosities.

    I count at least two entirely superfluous instances of 'pa', and if
there were a perfective marker in place of 'pra' things would be fine.

    I would think that aspect would be well enough known among language
planners that it would not be necessary to use examples from such a
messed-up verb system like that of English.  At the risk of becoming
tiresome, Glosa should not ape English's abominable verb system.

    Do tell: is "B-N" Binary Notation? Is it something like a "Botanical
Key" for the identification of plants?  I am obviously NOT a 'real' student
of either Linguistics or Computer Science, because I don't even recognise
the intials for this notation.
    But I'm sure that a couple of words from you will make it all plain.

    There are various combinations, but the main differences are in the way

    Alternative: write the name of the day of the week; and use the number
for the date.
                    Di-septi, 7 Meno-mo

    Ultra brief WRITTEN version:-
                    Septi, 7 Mo 99  [Sat, 7 Jan 99]

*   This is harder to disambiguate, but should be done with another
marker-word as was done with ~datu~ above.
    The word ~tem~ suggests itself; in combination with ~horo~, we get
~horo-tem~ [hour's time].  And, continuing in the same vein, we can enlist
~kron~ [measure of time, point in time] to handle the hours of the day:
there is ~horo-kron~ or the abbreviation, ~ho'kron~, being a Glosa version
of "O'Clock".

    Amazingly, all this comes out very nicely:-
     pre tri horo-tem  [in less than three hour's time]
     in seqe bi horo-tem  [in the next two hours]
     po deka horo-tem  [after ten hours]
     id es Six horo-kron  [it is six O'Clock]
     pre Six ho'kron  [before six O'Clock]  {shorter version}
     na habe bi ho-tem pre Six ho'kron [we have two hours before Six]
     tu nece habe bi horo te akti id  [you'll need two hours to do it]
     u tem nu eqa Penta horo [it is now Five|the time is now 5 O'Clock]

Suggested additions to the Glosa lexicon:-
  . Capitalisation for: hours of the day    Mo horo\Mo ho'kron
                        days of the week    Di-bi|Bi
                        months of the year  Meno-tri|Tri
  . horo-tem    (duration)
  . ho-tem      (  "  "  - abbreviation)
  . horo-kron   (hour of the day)
  . ho'kron     ( "    "  "   " , O'Clock)

*   This is the scary part.
    I am getting feedback that absorbing Glosa ^by osmosis^ is very hard to
do.  The first _Glosa 6000_ dictionary had more grammatical detail in it
than the recent, 1992, edition, and I hark back to what I remember from
this first publication.
    Also, it was only after much mental straining, that I intuitively
discovered that the "Head Final" structure, they talked about on Conlang,
was another version of the Glosa epithet, that a word is modified by its
precedent(s).
    And years afterwards, while trying to study some grammar, my intuition
was supported by statements about English-language Functional Grammar
having the words, of a Head Final phrase, on a ^rising plane^, i.e. there
really was a proscribed sequence for the ordering of words in a phrase, and
it was one of 'increasing importance'.
    Now, I don't think that Hogben mentioned anything about this, and the
Glosa authors did not, either; however, the 'Head Final' business must have
been perceived intuitively, and even at the subconscious level, by Clark
and Ashby, because it formed their thinking about syntax; and, from the
start, similar glimmerings of perception must also have been in Hogben's
mind when he selected the sentence structure of English as his basic model
for that of Interglossa.

>> I think some things can be determined empirically.
>That is what I call science.
>
*   But with our imperfect knowlege of how language works ... and how the
mind works ... how much science can be applied to the ^art^ of
communication?  I read Villain's books, _Good English_, _Better English_,
and _The Best English_ in sequence .. to be both shocked and delighted to
learn - in the last - that the 'best' users of English were so, because
they knew how to *break* the rule, creatively: theirs were not the normal
boring phrases, but the unexpected ones!

    One feels naked and exposed!
    Me .. only .. I thought Glosa was a good idea that just needed a bit of
a following, and it would take off!?
    Seems like a big blunder of judgment on my part!!
    I'm not unrepentant, I just guess that everybody's been so busy making
capitalism work for them, that they have failed to bounce back - after the
war - to pre-war, relaxed conditions when people did strange, altruistic
things.
    If the B-N thing can be humanised to cope with the ^round corners^ and
^soft edges^ of language, then I'd like to be part of the process - as far
as it goes for Glosa.

    I still think that there is an enormous problem with the human use of
language, and that much more Deep Thought is needed before we reach the
solution.

 Robin G.

    I'll have to admit this is fairly cute ^nose thumbing^ in the use of

    If everything must be dusted off, and placed in its appropriate drawer,
then the language is a 'dead' museum exhibit.  Whereas if there is some
^oil and mud^ on the words, and even some ^blood and guts^ in their
delivery, we get real language, which, though not obviously following
rules, carries the full force of emotion, and which may look and sound
wrong if cleaned up, like that famous song: "I cannot get any satisfaction."

     We understand this to be the way Glosa works, but I feel that it is
necessary to differentiate between this "Syntax-based" approach and the
more inflected, highly-marked system that obtains in most natlangs .. when
teaching people Glosa.

*   The Glosa system does appear to work, as Clark and Ashby said it would,
twenty years ago.  The Phrase Boundary situation does seem to favour some
redundancy, in the form of using the various categories of particles.
    Myself, having once worked as a teacher, am very conscious of the
situation of a first time learner being presented with Glosa.  This is my
reason for trying to imagine how the Glosa system of grammar will be
taught.  In fact, Klaus Langkilde, at Oak Log Middle School, Atlanta, has
demonstrated that Primary School children do readily pick up the
fundamentals of Glosa - more quickly than the adults of Auxlang/Glosalist,
I am sorry to say.  I guess that you could say, in considering the
mass-teaching problems of Glosa, I am conducting a problem-solving exercise
for a problem that hasn't happened yet.

>
*   Yes, Prepositions have generally been kept short and 'comfortable to
say', but ~trans~ does seem to have slipped through.  However, it doesn't
feel too bad to me as a Preposition, EG
 Fe ki trans u via.  [She goes across the road.] {Rolls off the tongue easily}
    But as a 'verb' I find it less comfortable, EG
 U ju-fe pa trans u fluvi per navi.  [The girl crossed the river by boat.]

    An alternative for short prepositional use, might be ~dia~ = through,
across, diagonally, EG
 Un alti andra pa greso dia un agri.
[The tall man walked through|across the field.]

*    That's good news, because this simple system works well for Glosa, and
must also be the system that is ^naturally selected^ during the process of
creolisation.

Thank you, Charles, for suggesting we look at Burd's work.

*   The fact that only a handful of Auxlang/Glosalist subscribers have

possibly a Public Domain Vocabulary combined with a snazzily presented,

*   Statistically, chronologically, and organisationally Clark-Ashby
are running out of people, time, and steam.  They mightn't like the fact
that a lot of authoritarian people like grammar books, but they are stuck
with the fact that language research attracts a lot of control freaks who
believe they ^have ways of making you talk^.
    I won't guarantee that a good cyber dictionary and cyber grammar will
make Glosa ^go like a rocket^, but I think they will cause an acceleration
in the language's dissemination. ... And hopefully, will not be so far from
the authors ideals, that such electronic publishing causes any
disagreements between groups of Glosa speakers.

>I for one still do not know their position on anything going on about

>disagree.
*   My understanding is that the authors would be ecstatic to recieve
e-mails from complete strangers who found their language on the Net, and
gave it a whirl.  I am a great believer in ^the proof of the pudding being

*   There is, apart from 'theory' and 'empirical study', also the 'nature'
of language, itself.  This is the area of Glosa's contribution to Language
Reform that I have been pushing , quite unsuccessfully, for a number of
years: I have described it as the "intuitive feel" for language, known to
poets and creative writers.
    An analogy, in another area of communication has: the *composer*;
the person *who has perfect pitch and remembers all his tunes*; and the
person, who knows little theory and may not be able to whistle a tune, but
*plays from the heart, with feeling*.
    In art, it is called "letting the medium talk to you".  I believe that
we should be listening harder to the medium of language to discover what it
is saying to us!

    From the above, you will understand that I like both order and a level
of organised chaos, but lean in the direction of "what works".
    Perhaps some of us come up with a ^rule of thumb^ grammar for Glosa,
and Charles can teach us how to 'B-N_ise' it.

RM has just changed ISPs, so the new URL for his essays is

Quoting from this essay:

It has a partial BNF syntax of English, which could be

relative clauses, complete with examples and discussion
of how other languages handle such things.

All of the above must happen; they are only competing priorities,

Uh, well if nobody else does, I may come up with something.
Browse through Morneau's essay on "syntax" to see if you'd like it.

More likely, Glosa needs actual speakers on this list, right away.

I have thought of writing a HTML form page to translate
to/from Glosa; of course this would be re-packageable
as an offline unix-filter-like command-line-program.
It is easier to do this for an analytic lang like Glosa,
than something synthetic like Ido. If anybody has some
thoughts to add on this, I'd be interested.

    Robin, it is very problematic to imbed color directives
in plain-ASCII email.  Some mail readers can handle them and
some report them as gibberish.  Trying to do so is similar
to trying to imbed ANSI screen controls in messages.  Some
displays more or less roll over and die with such.  Better
to keep to plain text.

    There is a big problem here.  If Glosa is to be never more than
a written code, then these suggestions may work.  However, a SPOKEN
language CANNOT depend on written tricks such as capitalization,
punctuation, or other such graphical gimmicks.  (Recall that Arabic
script has no such distinction as upper- and lower-case letters and
therefore no such thing as capitalization.)  It is similar with
hyphens, doodads to mark "figurative" language, and so on (if any).
Is Glosa ever to be spoken or only written?

    Apart from some personal matters, my biggest problem has been a
consistent and optimized vocabulary.  I don't want to learn one
vacabulary and then have to revamp it.  As for the grammar, I think
it might be a good idea to have one in the background, so to speak,
but as I have mentioned before, I think an enhanced Mechanics of Glosa
might be adequate for those who just encounter the language for the
first time and might be put off by a dry grammar statement.  In that
sense, I can go with A&C's approach -- up to a point.

    The main thing that I see is inconsistent vocabulary lists which

I hope so! I've always considered Glosa to be a spoken language myself. This
is why it interests me so much. Many Manx speakers are now debating the way
in which dates and times should be represented. One of the suggestions is to
place the day first, then the month, then the year as in English, e.g.:
Jedoonee, yn chiaroo laa as feed, Toshiaght Arree,
nuy keead jeig kiar feed as nuy jeig.
(Sunday, the twenty-fourth day, January, nineteen hundred and ninety nine).

It is important, but not everything. Linux is catching on
in big engineering departments, on its true merits alone.
Microsoft will be stopped; I remember when it was "IBM and
the Seven Dwarfs", and they said to learn COBOL ...

Glosa has one thing no other has: pidginesque grammar. This is
the easiest for adults to learn, and that is the true market;
not the polyglots and first-language learners. If presented
properly (which requires a 100% complete product, not a beta)
then people will seize upon it as being FUN ...

Perhaps it is scary because you know it is incomplete.
A solid product needs no apology; Glosa is still "beta"
because it was a mostly amateur undertaking. However,
looking at history, it is clear that a "Lingua Franca"
can emerge among amateurs, and spread rapidly, and be
both fun and USEFUL. Such languages are pidgins, and
their properties are known: SVO word order, no morphology,
reduced vocabulary, mostly CV phonology, forgiving grammar.

> I am getting feedback that absorbing Glosa ^by osmosis^ is very hard to

I like Paul's grouped vocabulary; it is a winner.
It should be extended to the Glosa 2000+.
We could do something reminiscent of the Peano trick,
start talking about Glosa in English with a few examples
and then phase out English a bit at a time. Not just on
a web page, but here on the list(?).

A pidgin could go either way, head-initial for French-based
creoles is common. Either is equally good, but English
and Chinese are both head-final.

That part, I still don't see. "A pretty little girl" goes
"adj adj adj noun" in my mind, while dashing the "pretty-little"
changes it to "adj ADV-adj noun ... My way of thinking
is based on Jesperson's analysis of primary (= noun)
vs. secondary (= adjective) vs. tertiary (= adverb).
So in Glosa I'm thinking of noun phrases being basically like
"art adv-adj adv-adj ... noun", if that makes sense.

He said that English and Chinese were the most analytical, and
that seemed best. Bodmer's and Flesch's books supported this view.
Hogben wanted to jump ahead to where English was apparently
going, not to re-create it or stay with "Basic English".
Today, he would be comparing it to pidgins instead, because
English has become ever-more idiomatic, the bane of an IAL.

The best language is shocking and delighting, i.e. poetic.
But idiom is stale poetry, i.e. boring and bureaucratic.

The vocab and grammar need to be finished, then the fun part
of use and distribution could begin. Maybe the better way
to finish the vocabulary is to start translating stuff ... ?
I still think comparison of the Ido 4000 to Glosa 6000 shows that
Ido's is far better. Think of all the work that went into it,
Zamenhof through Jesperson. Borrow!

This was my way of ensuring that the grammar is complete;
it still seems to me to have major gaps. Relative clauses,
adverbial phrases, attachment ambiguities ... all can be
resolved in beta. Things like the semicolon punctuation
really don't work.

But it will never be 100% complete. Reach a critical mass,
maybe 98%, then shove off! June 1999?

     Neither Paul nor Charles, who are the most regular posters to this

I Have recieved only two other emails with these features: emboldening from
Robert Petry (Auxlang); and a word in colour from someone else.
     This embellishment has insignificant value in 1999 - and I guess will
only be worthwhile around 2005, when most present hardware and software
systems have been "heritaged".

    Copyright ticks, no, but you might work on a teaching method for Glosa

decided to send in my thoughts - to see how they check against yours.
.. Glosa as incomplete in several areas:
  - Standardisation of lexicon
  - Need for technical lexicons in all areas
  - Graded range of dictionaries of different lengths and complexity
  - Sound recordings of spoken Glosa
  - Range of literature in text form, also in FTP and on cassette
  - Business-wise publishing of Glosa literature and learning materials
  - Instruction on Glosa in all major natlangs
  - A range of self-instruction texts at different levels
  - "How to Teach Glosa" instruction for teachers at different levels
  - Sylabusses for purposes of course design and acreditation
  - An "Akademi" to foster, protect and develop Glosa
    ...... That's all I can think of for now ......
.. Basically its design is simply a pidgin:
  # Not bad: pidgins are pragmatic trading interlanguages.
  # I would have thought of it more like the creoles, which are more
'natural'.
  # The authors appear to have selected the pidgin-creole pattern
unconsciously, by simple genius.
  # The disadvantage is that pidgins are languages of necessity, made to
work despite difficulty in their introduction: while Glosa still has the
quality of difference from ethnic languages, few see any urgency
to learn it when they perceive no necessity to do so.
.. Little lee-way for creativity:
  % Poetry has been written in Glosa
  % I have translated some difficult passages on Conlang from Edmund
Grimly-Evans, and "The Wolf" on Glosalist, provided by Bill Patterson
  % Perhaps you refer to the turns of phrase, constructed differently from
those of the natlangs .. nrrding to be spelled out more descriptively
  % You most probably refer to the lexical derivatives formed through
addition of various affixes, or through inflection
  %% I believe that, with adoption, it will be decided that Glosa needs
conventions for the formation of derivative words, and these will be in
line with the way scientists now derive new terms by modifying the old.
  %~% Please give more details about the creativity shortfall in Glosa.
  ~%~ Also give English-language examples of texts that are likely to be
beyond Glosa's creative capacities.

    However, on the question of my motivation behind setting up the
Glosalist, some might be curious.  Originally, I took the Language Reform
concept seriously, when, in 1977 I Joined the Bahai Faith, and read what
Baha'u'llah said about the need for an International Auxiliary Language.
By a strange co-incidence, later that year, I met the authors of what was
then Euro-Glossa.
    I could see the basic pattern was sound, and had regular discussions
with Ronald Clark - while the language, 'Proto-Glosa', was still on the
drawing board.  I was drawn into the idea, and suggested that I could apply
my education background to furthering this social invention, which, in
starting so far behind the obvious front-runner, Esperanto, would need some
serious help if it was to close the gap.
    Numerous modifications to the language - and two decades - later, I
felt that creating a Net home of its own was the best way I could broaden
exposure to the Glosa concept.  A lot of work was needed, but, if I could
find others who would also appreciate the beauty of the design, the
fledgeling Glosa would soar higher than if I made my contribution in
isolation.
    Glosa might not seem ready for the coming global contest, just yet,
but with multiple tweaking from the Glosalist team, it can be ready to face
the "judges" sooner.

    I hope to see postings from others on this list, who might have been
fairly quiet up to now,  - pushing in the same direction Charles is doing -
"towards real usefulness."

    We are going to run up against this problem all the time in Glosa, when
it comes to matters where the fineness of division of categories almost
never ends.  Do we worry about people wering distictive items of clothing,
or are we going to be happy - in this age of survival - that people are
simply wearing "clothing"?  There are all manner of animals, and when it
comes to dogs, are we going to include all the breeds of dogs in the Glosa
dictionary?  Regarding common plants and animals, once we have all the
necessary functionwords and 'essential' substantives, there is room for
only a token collection of plant and animal names in a "Glosa 2.5K".
    Is there a valid policy that allows us to draw the line - the line
between the generic necessities, like "clothes" and "food", and specialist
items, such as a "wolf-skin fur coat" and "smoked salmon"?

*   Like you, Bill, I love words, and the power of discrimination they
give, but I wonder at what stage in someone's introduction to a new
language, they should be taught to make such fine distinctions as that
between the concepts of "hasty" and "swift".
    This question came to light when I was attempting to translate _The
Wolf_ into Glosa: the English-language original was full of what I would
call literary language, exploring the limits of the lexicon, even in
English.  While I enjoyed the challenge of doing this translation, I
realised that it was only of 'academic' interest, because many of the Glosa
words I found to give the particular nuances, would not have been in the
dictionaries of most Glosa-pe, and will not be in the proposed "2.5K Net
Dictionary".
    For the present, it seems that the concepts "hasty", "fast" and "swift"
might have to be rolled into one Glosa concept-word, IE ~tako~.
    Limitations on the length of the dictionary are of two types: an
ideological restriction suggests that Glosa is adequate for normal
communication with less words than other languages; and for learning
purposes, the shorter the dictionary the sooner one can master it.  In,
however, restricting the dictionary, we reduce the quality of
discrimination in the communication it allows: this explains my use of a
term like 'an optimal Glosa dictionary', not too long and not too short.
    So, I find the pressure to both optimise the dictionary and make it
adequately discriminatory, as well, has a ^having our cake, and eating it,
too^ quality about it.

*   Yes, this is an error on my part: ~metri~ [measure] and ~metra~
[metre], while both from the same Latin source, are quite distinct
concepts, and need different lexemes!
    The trans-Atlantic confusions in English, however, I cannot cope with,
and will stick to the Standard Oxford Dictionary: for me a "meter" is a
measuring machine, thus I would guess that "electricity meter" becomes, in
Glosa, ~elektro-metri-me~.

*   Yes I will agree with your idea of consistency - don't know now where I

the English -> Glosa section.

landa~.
    While it would be nice to allow for a range of emperors, kings, czars,
sovereigns and rulers, in general, I prefer - for beginners - the more
generic ~regi-an~, ~regi-do~, and ~regi-landa~ (or even ~regi-lo~ at a pinch).

*   Glosa does 'Generic Terms', which change the meaning of a word,
extending the lexicon EG -pe, -lo, -ze, etc.
    About a year ago, it was mooted that there might be a second list of
such affixes, and four letters in length seemed suitable; Paul Bartlett was
one calling for such an extension of the lexicon.  It seems obvious that
this innovation is necessary, to make Glosa more workable, when  people
wish to use more sophisticated terminology.
    KAPITALISMO is already in the dictionary, and it could be a compound
of KAPITALA and the -ISMO |abstract noun/principle| Generic Term affix.
So, the authors have used -ISMO, but have used to create a new lexeme
rather than to form a compound using hyphenation.

*   I agree that in this modern age, we need a much larger range of words
than is allowed, at present, by the pure lexemes, compounds of
substantives, and compounds made up from the eighteen, two-letter Generic
Term affixes.
    An -ISTI would be much more important than a -PE, and such a
distinction is necessary.  In principle, it would do the job, but, before
such an affix system was introduced, it would need to be related to the
existing heirarchy of words.  What affixes were needed, and, how they
related to existing category affixes within the natlangs, would have to be
worked out.

   This is just another job to add to the list.

Saluta,
 Robin G.

    This usage is in _Glosa 6000_ so "belong" is not really an omission.
    ~pertine~ [pertain to] = "belongs to" or "refers to"
    This is straight from the Latin dictionary, and points to a
relationship, often of ownership.

        X belongs to Y.

    I was foxed by the word: ~kamera~ is a primitive meaning "box"; a room
is a box (or boxed part of a house); and a photographic camera is a
mini-room with one window (lens) that lets light fall on the opposite
inside wall (sensetive plate).
  TEKA = "box"; MERO = "part"
  teKA'MERO -> KAMERA = (boxed part of house) "room"

    The Latin dictionary carries ..
       de-tego : to uncover, lay bare, unroof; to reveal, disclose.
    Without doing a search, I guess that ~heuresi~ with its awkward
difthong is derived from the Greek.  It is harder to pronounce, and a much
less known root and concept - in modern culture.  If 2.5K-wise, we can get
away with just one word for this area, I still favour ~detekti~.

    But then, I have not drilled myself to think this way, at speed.

    For Glosa, I do believe that, at the start, the structure of compounds needs to be shown - using hyphens - to show the joins.  I have also stated, before, that this could be a worthwhile ploy when using computers for the machine-handling of information - allowing the computer reader to identify each lexeme and affix.

    I found, in Gopsill, p212 "Affixes in Schematic and Natural Languages Compared", but this did not give me a full list of the Interlingua affixes: where can I find such a list?


    As someone born Pre-war, I still prefer to look up a book than download a file; where can I buy a book containing Interlingua's affixes?

Thinking out loud:

prep [art] adv-adj adv-adj ... noun
tense [art] adv-adv adv-adv ... verb

Could tense really be a type of prep, and adv-adv really be adv-adj, and verb
just be noun.
The blank prep means subject (no other prep can be elided, not even tense, else
it's just too confusing)..
The prep "??" means sometime/same time as before/time defined by adverb etc.
Usually don't have art after tense, but it is allowed.

I think these two would work. As I recall, there were quite a few -ISMO
and -ISTI words in which the "suffix" has the appropriate meaning, and
only a very few exceptions. I'll take another look at those exceptions
and see if they would really be too much of a problem.

Agreed! I think we can safely synonymize ~detekti~ and ~heuresi~, with
~detekti~ being the preferred word and ~heuresi~ a literary alternative.

    Again, how does one speak a semicolon?  More to the point, if 'ke'
merely tries to reproduce English 'that', we run into the semantic
overloading confusion of English in Glosa, hardly likely to endear
itself to those who do not already know English.

    There definitely should not be.  Time and again I become almost
dismayed at how Glosa becomes little more than recoded English, with
all the confusions of English for the non-native speaker.  We MUST not
smuggle English's monstrosities (which seem "natural" to us native
speakers) into a constructed auxlang.

    Not if it merely reproduces the semantic overloading of English.

    Credit must be given where it is due.  The idea is not original
with me.  Ashby&Clark have published in such a manner in some of their

which are repeated, for the most part, in categories.

If animal species constitute one of the top 100 "semantic fields",
and each field requires 100 terms, that fills the 10,000 CVCV words
defineable by a 5-vowel 20-consonant inventory ... Clothing, plants,
foods, shapes, etc are other obvious candidates. What I'd like to do
(if I could figure out how) would be to determine the fields first.
Then instead of a boring flat alphabetized dictionary, make a separate
"page" for each semantic field. The core vocabulary really depends
on what you are talking about; still, the Glosa 2500 is a step
in the right direction, just don't get too concerned about which
animals get into the ark.

Personally, I HATE derivational affixes ala Interlingua.
If they go over 2 or 3 letters in Glosa, I would not like them.

But going through these lists will expose any inadequacies

http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm

I've updated the dictionary files! Password, as before, is <password>.
The new dictionaries incorporate the previously omitted words, some
typo fixes, a few new words added for consistency, some more words
from Glosa 1000 that weren't included in Glosa 6000 for some reason,
and suggestions from the glosalist.

The Core dictionary now contains 2356 definitions, consisting of 1884
unique Glosa words. It would probably make a good base for the 2.5K!

I've also uploaded some sourcy files this time. My main source file
(ges.txt) can be found in source.zip; it has a few special formatting
character codes, like splats (*) in front of preferred synonyms, and
is the file from which all the dictionary files are generated by my
makefile.

Two intermediate files (egc.txt and gec.txt), which are themselves the
sources for the Glosa-English and the English-Glosa Core dictionaries,
can be found in core.zip; they contain the same data, one wordpair per
line, "lang1word = lang2word", but one is sorted by Glosa words and the
other by English words. They are the final step before the pageformatting
is performed for the Core dictionaries, and may be of use in creation of
the 2.5K.

Oops, I was afraid that would happen! I'll have to clarify a bit more
on that page.

There are five dictionaries, the GE, EGL,EGB, EGC and GEC, of descending
size and complexity, and these are the ones that have hyperlinks in the
left-hand column of the table. Each dictionary is available as a regular
zipfile and as a self-extracting DOS program; pick one or the other. So
that's ten files for the five dictionaries. But you only need to download
five files, the .zips *or* the .exes, to get all five.

The GE and (EGL or EGB) make a nice pair, as do the EGC and the GEC.

The extra files mentioned, SOURCE.ZIP and CORE.ZIP, are source files for
developers. SOURCE.ZIP contains the master source file (GES.TXT); CORE.ZIP
contains two intermediate files which are derived from GES.TXT and formatted
pagewise to create the EGC and GEC.

General comment... for printing, the five dictionary files are your best
bet. But for searching and such, you should probably get SOURCE.ZIP, one
big file with everything in it, one Glosa/English wordpair per line!

That's what I got. And I don't mean to criticize, but ...
It almost looks like it would be better as a tab-separated table.
Then, one could "sort +3 GES.TXT | ..." and such.
Also, it would be more easily importable into a SQL database.
But that isn't needed until there is more demand;
I can handle it with Perl scripts as-is.

Yep, and I've been known to pass files like this to tr or ex or vi
or sed to convert = to tab for further processing. I just never liked
tabs very much because you (usually) can't see them, and their effect
on output depends on the tab settings of the output device. So I rarely
use them. Except in makefiles because most makes require them. (And
then, to my surprise and disgust, I find that (by default) Reflection
FTP converts tabs to eight spaces in an ascii transfer. But that's a
whole 'nuther story!)

    Next question: after we agree, concensus-wise, on the best Glosa words
for the various omissions, how do we decide which of the omissions need to
go into the 2.5K Glosa Net Dictionary ... and when a number of English
words all point to one Glosa word, do we include most of these
thematically-related English words in the  Eng->Glo  sections of the "2.5K"
and "Ammended 6000" lists?

different forms of an exiting Glosa word, or synonyms for words that were
already covered in the Glosa dictionaries.

    This column comprised compounds and other forms derived from existing

    :New Forms:
    This column contains neologisms that were coined by me, almost
exclusively from the Latin dictionary.  This was as a last resort!

    All the time I was going through the Omissions List, I was aware of a
tension between the need to add a small number of essential words to the
Glosa lexicon, while intending, subsequently, to reduce the Glosa 6000 list
to something less than half its size: the two processes seemed to be moving
in opposite directions.
    However, I have done a first run through the 6000 list to 'cull' it,
and just have to complete the count to see if further 'culling' seems
necessary.

usages for this communication trio, but you may be moving into NewGlosa,

*   Not only is there a conflict in spelling - across the languages, "mile"

Glosa-pe from overseas will have to be given directions by a
Glosa-pe in America - using miles.
    Perhaps when spoken, it is U.S.-MILE; maybe when written, it could be
MILE<A> to indicate that it is an Archaic term.  Or, if you persist in
using "miles" in the States, then we might have to borrow from the languge,
Java, which 'imports' objects.
    Maybe Glosa will have to allow for the "importing" of cross-cultural
words from other languages, EG MILE<Imp>, or MILE<USA:Imp> with the U.S.A.
transposed to being a prefix in spoken communication.
    Kilos are here to stay, but miles will be phased out, one day -
depending on the inertia of US culture.  So it looks as if we might need a
NewWord to correspond with the continuing use of the out-dated "mile" in
America.  Since this is a continent-specific problem, I suggest that
American Glosa-pe come up with an alternative for "mile" that suits them.

Okay, so I'll use HEKTO = "hundred" and CENTI = "hundredth", though I'm
not completely comfortable with this because "100" seems such a fundamental
thing, counting and such, and we'll be inconsistent with *all* the Glosa
dictionaries that I've seen. But... I *do* think it's the right thing to do,
and at least *we* will be internally consistent!

I agree. I've added NIMA and NIMA-BILETA, with NOMINA as the preferred
synonym for "name".

The 6000 also has RADIA = "radiate", so this would make the dictionary
more consistent trailing-vowel-wise. But the 6000 I have doesn't have
"radio" at all, and making RADIO = "radio" would be an inconsistency
relative to the 6000, which currently kind of lumps together RADIA and
RADIO, neither of which has anything to do with radios.

I like that. I'll put "trait" with KARAKTERA and "unit" with UNITA, which
does make more sense. UNITA = "unit" also fits better with other UNI-words.
Don't know where that UNITA = "trait" came from, but it's right there in
my 6000 though it doesn't really fit.

I'd favor just dropping "mile" since it's only of use in, what, two?

Hey plu lojbanistani! Doesn't Lojban have a marker of some sort to show
that a word is borrowed from another language? We could have some such
marking word, possibly a generic, warning that the following word (or
phrase) may not mean what you might expect. Maybe this could handle
idioms too!

But I also noticed today that Glosa has no word for "thousandth". How
about MILI? Doesn't appear to conflict with anything else.

How to handle code-switching? ... It is common to use
change of pitch in speech, and italics or "scare quotes"
in print. I think this is much better than a morpheme.
Supra-segmentals always seem to get short shrift ...

"-" ... compounder
" " ... word break
"," ... phrase break
";" ... some strange noise in Glosa
"?",
"!",
"." ... all 3 as in Chinese

I like the usenet *asterisk* emphasis convention, very-high pitch.
Probably "a la mode" scare quotes for foreign phrases, slightly high.
Also (parenthetically) the voice-lowered parenthetical.
Print tends to short-shrift these essential intonation patterns.

    NIMA appears to be a truncated form of the Aeolic Greek dialectal
form 'onyma', which is found in words such as "synonym."  Why the
initial vowel was lopped off is a puzzlement to me.

    I would go with NOMINA myself, except that NIMA seems to be used

    An excellent point.  We have to beware of always trying to use the
English "is" with an adjective when 'habe' = "have" plus a substantive
will do just as well.  Nothing says that Glosa has to be a mirror image
of English.

the world.  Last I had ever heard, the only nations not officially

    "Dinner" is problematic, and I recommend that it not be used to
render or explain any Glosa word.  Just within the US alone, "dinner"
is used in three different ways to designate meals, depending on what
region one is in.

Sooner I hope, than later. Being a physicist and then an engineer,
Metric is my system of choice, though I use that other system as
necessary. I agree completely, no sense in trying to cover all
measurement systems in space and time! I think I just ignored "mile"
in this most recent update, and I'll probably just leave it out
permanently unless anybody really really wants it included.

Time ... year, month, week, day, hour, minute, second.
Space ... meter, "astronomical unit", light-year, parsec.
Color ... what a mess.

Once I wrote a page description lang ala Postscript,
and defined a syntax allowing a number to specify its
unit, such as inch or pixel or fraction of page width,
e.g. 8.0i or 3200d ...

Now, I know about http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/sipm.html
but that is still only part of the answer, since it isn't
at all convenient to say e.g. .000023 or 4.123e27 amps.
I'm not sure what to do about it, other than just saying
23 millionths amps, etc. Is there a better way?

This shows some more realistic examples, for fun:

    Apart from the small contingent of certified Linguists calling
themselves "Interlinguists", I have seen no evidence of the existence of
"language planners" apart from the assemblage of 'amateurs' on Conlang,
Auxlang and Glosalist.  If there was a science of it, IE Design
Linguistics, then we might expect repeatable experiments, and a gradual
refining of the principles of Language Design.  No such luck.
    The Principles are there, waiting to be codified and classified; and
designs for Linguistics experiments, that would yield repeatable results,
must be somewhere, possibly scribbled on the backs of envelopes.
    As a recognisable group working with scientific rigour, I believe there
is no such thing as Language Planners.

    As I wrote once before, all the world can hope for, by way of Global
Language Reform, is something from the bunch of amateurs on the
Conlang-related Lists.  It's far too dodgey an area for venture capitalists
to risk their money, or Research Directors to risk their Doctoral students.
    And worse: there's far too strong a theme of altruism running through
the whole region of global communication; and researchers will never be
able to cash in on their Intellectual Capital.  But ...
    Aha! That's it.
    We tell Bill Gates that NuSpeak is the next big breakthrough, and
there's a buck in it for him.  If anyone can force people to upgrade their
grammar and vocabulary, it will be Bill.  I don't look forward to the
regular appearance of improved versions of the usage, and I know there will
be a price-tag attached; but, its marketting dynamism like Bill's that will
drag us screaming and kicking, and talking NuSpeak, into the next century.

Maybe,

*   Actually the incompleteness is not my main worry: I do know that some
more semantic post-fixes are needed to allow more modification of the words
- via hyphenated compounding; and special interest lexicons are needed, to
allow universal discussion in Glosa.
    The really scary part is that I have caught onto the way Glosa works,
but others do not seem to have clicked on: is this something to do with the
fact that I have put in a lot of effort into trying to understand the Glosa
formula; are others, who are interested in Glosa, not writing in it because
the effort needed to understand the system is too great?  I had imagined
that others, brighter than I, would have forged ahead with Glosa, long
before now.

>A solid product needs no apology; Glosa is still "beta"
>because it was a mostly amateur undertaking.
*   I know that the authors did everything by hand, allowing variety to
creep into the dictionaries.  However they did expect more people to take
it up and support them, by writing in it, and promoting it.
    They seriously miscalculated the available creative energy in the
world: they left numerous openings for creative people to step in, and
develop the language; some have produced dictionaries in other natlangs,
and small groups have set up in various places, but a strong central
co-ordination did not emerge.  The reason for this has been largely
financial; however, academic and political groups that might have taken it
up have not come forward.  Maybe this is yet another consequence of the
"beta" nature of the language: when we get it to the 98% mark, then
perhaps, academics will look at it.
    I would rather have written more children's stories in Glosa, while
others, more business-minded, helped with the promotion and dissemination
of the language.  However, this Glosalist has come from my initiative, in
the absence of enterprise from others.  I am searching, again, for those
creatives who have the vision to see Glosa's potential, and who are
prepared to play a part in this ^Civilisation Advance^.

*   True, and I am tipping that the Net community will be the first
significant group to develop the "leverage" necessary to seriously set
about solving the Language Problem.  It can be fun, but Glosa needs to
identify a meaningful area of endeavour, in which global dialogue,
though essential, is currently absent, and for which Glosa can provide the
missing medium of communication.  Weather change and weather control come
to mind, as possible areas for global discourse.

*   So Glosa has the magic "pidgin pattern", but still needs a level of
standardisation, and also needs a ^critical mass^ of users.  While pidgins
are easier to learn than most other languages, people still need a reason
for learning them, and I am getting the message, that "saving the world" is
not a strong enough reason for learning a language.
    Re the grammar, I imagine that an IAL needs a robust grammar, one that
delivers the goods despite rough handling.  This need, to permit the
transmission of meaning even with variations from the 'perfect', is a
dimension that I am trying to discover during the formulation of Glosa's
grammar.

*   Yes, but.  If this is Jesperson's analysis, it is, at best, parallel to
the way Glosa works.  The analysis of English grammar closest to that of
Glosa is Functional Grammar, which started with Halliday.
    The "adv-adj" before an English-language Noun translates into a
"modifier" before a Glosa Substantive: the Substantive at the Head of the
phrase might be a 'verb' or a 'noun', though this latter info comes, not
from the shape of the word, but from the position in the sentence of the
phrase that contains it.
    And while the "modifier is usually a word more prone to describing than
being described, it could also be a full Substantive, capable of funtioning
as 'noun', 'verb', or 'modifier': its role as 'modifier', however, is
defined by its position in the phrase; and, if a 'modifier' precedes
another 'modifier', then we can say it is modifying a 'modifier'.  This is
Jesperson's "adv-adj adv-adj" sequence, but such an analysis is too coarse
for Semantic Grammar, which takes over, where Syntactic Grammar leaves off.
 EG
  English:   THREE  BIG  GREEN  EAT  APPLE

   Glosa:    tri   mega  kloro  vora  pomi

   Of these two sequences, which can be used directly in a sentence?
   While you read the first, and wonder if it is part of an IQ test
quoted out of context; by the time you've finished reading the second,
you are imagining that you have sunk your teeth into one of them, and it's
tasting good.

   These two word-strings illustrate a number of points:-
    . the first needs an inflection (ING) and an agreement (S) before it
can form a Noun Phrase;
    . in both, the final word (APPLE, pomi) is the most obvious object;
    . EAT has the form of the infinitive verb, ~vora~ is a substantive;
    . while EAT APPLE might be an imperative, ~vora pomi~ suggests an
"eating apple";
    . ~tri pomi~ translates to "three apples" with no agreement needed;
    . GREEN EAT does not look like two adjectives in the middle of a NP,
while ~kloro vora~ before the final word of the first, or last, phrase in a
simple transitive Glosa sentence, is obviously a pair of
'modifiers', with the former modifying the latter, and the combined pair
modifying the Head of the Noun Phrase.

   Now I ask subscribers to re-arrange the order of the 'modifiers' in the
Glosa sequence: does it work?
   Magically, as if held in place by invisble elastic strands, the four
words before the Head tend to spring back into their original places,
despite attempts to force the phrase to make sense with a different sequence.
   The words before ~pomi~ are all attached to it, but with different
degrees of attachment: ~tri~ is held very loosely, having the strength of a
numerate determinant; with ~mega~, we have the fairly non-specific
indicator of proportion; next, with ~kloro~, we start getting a bit more
specific, there not being too many colours of apples; and, finally, with
~vora~ we arrive at the very spicific distinction in apples, between
"eating" and "cooking" varieties.
   So, somewhat long-windedly, I have demonstrated that the modifiers in a

   - spelling tending towards phonetic;
   - some double letter spellings reduced singles;
   - simplification of vowel use;
   - metaphoric usage increasing allowing words to cross P-o-S boundaries.

    YES, it has been agreed that Glosa's ultra-numeric dating system needs
disambiguation between days, months and years, and ... also there
must be recognisable distinctions, between these categories, in both speech
and writing.

Just to recap., here is my thought on it, again:-

VERBOSE:-
  Spoken:   Di-septi, datu tri-mo, Meno-mo, Mo-nona-nona-nona

  Written:  Di-septi, datu 31 Meno-mo 1999

BRIEF:-
  Spoken:   Di-septi, tri-mo, Mo, Nona-nona

  Written:  Septi, 31 Mo 99
 ------------------------------------------------------------
 There is no ambiguity in the above, unless, you don't observe,,, the
commas!  In my book, a comma represents a PAUSE, thus the following three
renditions of the "BRIEF Spoken" example would sound different:-

  Di-septi, tri-mo, Mo, Nona-nona

  Di-septi  tri-mo  Mo  Nona-nona *

  Di-septi-tri-mo-Mo-Nona-nona *

   And, if the un-starred version is read out (observing all commas, of
course) with 'falling vocal inflection', it sounds better, and more
natural, than if read out with level pitch.
   Please note: there will be Glosa versions of the date between the
Verbose and Brief forms, above; but, as long as they give sufficient
discrimination between the three, or four, component categories, then they
are functional, whether spoken or written.

    It is fascinating to think that the process we are going through, with

    I would be more understanding of your position, Paul, if you could give
examples where English does things badly, and where a different language
does the same job better.

    My feelings are that the more 'naturalistic' an AL is, then the greater
appeal it will have to the largest number of people.  Hence I have been
following closely the discussions of pidgins and creoles on Auxlang: these
ad hok languages seem to have learnability and a slew of similar grammatic
features.
    Do we know about a worthwhile creole model for Glosa's Tense Particles?

*   OK, Knocking out two out of three ~pa~s leaves the whole responsibility
for pastness on the ~pa~ in the first clause.  And with a 'Perfective
Particle' in the penultimate clause, that leaves the setting of the time of
the action to just two particles.
    As I understand it, there is a question of "redundancy": possibly, over
that first ~pa~, a fly could get squashed onto the paper, as it did in the
film, "Brazil," causing the reader to lose the sense of pastness (and, in
the film, much worse).  I know real life doesn't ape art, but I am making a
point, here, about the possible need for a reminder, or two, on the timing
of the action.
    Also, there are those of us, with our psychological complexes, who
enjoy keeping our sentences in time, and feel cheated when we have to
stretch simple infinitives to cover a range of times.  Maybe there is
something comfortable and homey about being reminded about the tense, every
verb.

counter-productive, causing some to react against verbose usage.
    In the first sentence of the last paragraph, I used what might be

think of doing the same with "PRA" viz, `PRA had(PerfectivePast particle)`?

"Nonpunctual" corresponds to "completive" vs. "continuative".
Ido eventually needed to add a perfective -ab- and a passivizer
infix -es- to its verbal system, and I think Glosa needs them too.
Having a passive makes serial verb constructions easier,
and those are far more tractable than baroque prepositions.

I think that it is time for me to speak up a bit, though I tend to be

the advantage of resolving such problems as we shall undoubtedly see in
the years about to come of the meaning of 01/02/03.
I would therefore like to suggest that the "official" way of dating in
Glosa be in accordance with this standard, i.e., (YY)YY-MM-DD, with
whatever dividing marker [/,.- &c] we choose.  Other than that, terms MO
and DI can, of course be used.

    Glosa already has a passive construction, although there is some
disagreement as to what form it should take.  G.E.O. publications,
with which I agree, use the form 'es ge-X'.  If I have understood him
corectly, Robin plumps for the form 'gene ge-X,' using what I think is
a dangerously ambiguous counterpart of that English monstrosity "get."

    As for aspect particles, of course there are many aspects.  I have
favored a simple perfective and imperfective.  Glosa already has 'du'
for imperfective, and recently I brought up the issue of a perfective
aspect particle.  'No-du' would be technically correct, as the opposite
of 'du', but I do not like it.  However, so far I do not have a
solution within the already existing vocabulary source (which I want to
stay within as much as possible).

    By the way, Charles, I am curious as to whether you have ever
looked at my frater2 project:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/frater2.html

I did it more as an exercise in language specification rather than as
a complete IAL project (with a Hogbenish verb system), as I never
completed a vocabulary.  The vocabulary of the original FRATER was a
somewhat Glosa-like lexicon with a more limited phonemic inventory.

    For the time being, I have decided to get off my hobby horse about
redundant verb tense marking.  However, I do find it somewhat curious
that so many examples are in the past tense.  Whatever happened to the
present and the future?

    Tense and aspect are two different things.  It is only messy
languages like English which tense to squash them together.  My
understanding is that Russian, for instance, does a much better job of
keeping them distinguished.  Because tense and aspect are *not* the same
thing, I think that in a well-planned IAL, they should be kept separate
so that a speaker can use one without the other as needed and/or
appropriate.  (See also below.)

    Beside, why have only a past perfect?  Why not a future perfect, a
present perfect, a conditional perfect (which is even a worse mishmash
of tense, aspect, and mood), subjunctive and optative moods, and a
middle voice (as did classical Greek)?  Why not keep it simple and allow
a speaker to specify what s/he wants individually?  If you still think
you have to indicate both past tense and perfective aspect, why not just
specify them separately with distinct particles?  It is not as if we are
talking about some kind of burdensome apparatus here.  In my frater2
project, I kept tense and aspect separate.

    From my limited perspective, the English verb system is a mess,
even though as a native speaker I am accustomed to it.  I have_heard*
non-native adult learners really struggle with the complications of
English verbs, and they often get them "wrong" (and this structural
peculiarity completely apart apart from those lexical bastards, the
English phrasal verbs, which drive a lot of learners half bonkers).
I am basing my remarks on both structural grounds and the difficulties
I have experienced with English-as-a-Second-Language adult learners.
We native speakers can be deceived by our familiarity.

    As for examples, I am reluctant even to give examples from English,
it being the mess that it is.  But let us distinguish tense and aspect.
Tense for the most part expresses time reference, such as present, past,
or future.  Aspect, as my desk dictionary puts it, is "the nature of
the action of a verb as to its beginning, duration, completion, or
repetition and without reference to its position in time."  Tense and
aspect are separable notions.  Why combine them confusingly and
inconsistently in a single particle (inconsistently if one is going to
do it only for a single combination of tense and aspect)?  There are
many aspects one could mark, of course, but I think imperfective and
perfective would do for a language like Glosa.

    (* Here is one example from English I will use.  In this instance of
"have heard," it is called a "present perfect tense," but is is actually
more of an imperfective aspect with both past and present tenses, with
even an implication of futurity -- a real conglomeration!  It is
imperfective in aspect, because the hearing is actually something
ongoing.  It is past in tense but actually overlaps with the present
with an unspoken implication, being imperfective, that it could extend
into the future.)

>     My feelings are that the more 'naturalistic' an AL is, then the greater

    "Naturalistic" may be a decepttion.  If we are talking about an
auxlang intended for global use, what seems "natural" to speakers of
Indo-European languages (particularly, say, English or French) may seem
quite "unnatural" and even bizarre to speakers of other language
families, and vice versa.  We must not be led astray by comfortable
familiarity with our own native habits and assume that they are somehow
"natural" for all human beings.  Although I know I have posted it before
at least on AUXLANG, I will reproduce a short piece from a work of
fiction which may illustrate my point:

      Consider the following excerpt from David Eddings' fantasy novel,
  "Domes of Fire" (1992).  Eddings' fantasy series "The Elenium" and its
  sequel "The Tamuli" are set in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, medieval
  world with the common motifs of chivalry, magic, religion, and so on.
  Kalten is a brave and likable, but not always bright, Church Knight of
  Elenic language, race, and religion, and the Church Knights are trained
  to cast spells using the Styric tongue.  Sephrenia is a polyglot wisewoman
  of the Styric race.  In this episode, an Elenic party are in the Tamul
  Empire and need to learn to speak Tamul.  Incidentally, linguistic theory
  is not my point here.  My point is the misjudgment of considering that
  one's own language is somehow the "natural" way that all humans think.

          "Kalten, dear," [Sephrenia] said gently, why was I trying
        to teach you Styric?"
          "So that I could perform magic tricks, I guess."  He
        shrugged.  "That's unless you just enjoy making people
        suffer."
          "No, dear one.  It was just as painful for me as it was for
        you."  She shuddered.  "More painful, probably.  You _were_,
        in fact, trying to learn Styric so that you could work the
        spells, but in order to do that, you had to be able to _think_
        in Styric.  You can't just mouth the words and make them come
        off the way you want them to."
          "Wait a minute," he objected.  "Are you saying that people
        who speak other languages don't think the same way we do?"
          "They may think the same way, but they don't think in the
        same words."
          "Do you mean to say that we actually think in words?"
          "Of course we do.  What did you think thoughts were?"
          "I don't know.  But we're all human.  Wouldn't we all think
        in the same way and in the same language?"
          She blinked.  "And which language would that be, dear one?"
          "Elenic, naturally.  That's why foreigners aren't as clever
        as we are.  They have to stop and translate their thoughts from
        Elenic into that barbarian gabble they call language.  They do
        it just to be stubborn, of course."
          She stared at him suspiciously.  "You're actually serious,
        aren't you?"
          "Of course.  I thought everybody knew that's why Elenes are
        smarter than everybody else."  His face shone with blinding
        sincerity.
          "Oh, dear," she sighed in near despair,

    I do feel rather strongly about this issue.  I think that a planned
auxiliary language, unless it is deliberately designed to function
primarily in more or less one linguistic ambience, such as Interlingua,
should be very leery of importing too many peculiarities of a single
language or language family.

    It is also very English and may not seem "comfortable and homey" at
all to speakers of non-Indo-European languages.  We have to keep others
in mind as well if we want Glosa to have a shot at being a global
auxiliary.  But as I said, I will try not to keep harping on this
redundant-marking business, as long as others are permitted to do things
otherwise.

    I brought this up before.  We have 'du' as an imperfective particle
already.  Unfortunately I do not know of a good perfective particle
within the existing word stock.  As I mentioned, 'no-du' would be
technically correct in an Esperantic sort of fashion, but I don't really
like it.  As I also mentioned, some auxlangs use an adverb somewhat
counterpart to "already" to convey perfective notions, but "already" is
rendered by 'pre-nu', but 'nu' conveys too much presentness to my taste
when dealing with aspect.  So far I have not come up with anything.

To: Glosalist
Date: Sun, 31 Jan 99 17:2

    I just thought of an example which demonstrates the horrible
messiness of the English verb system.  (And the sentence happens
to be true in my own case. :-) )

I have been going to school recently.

In the school grammar that I learned, this would be called a "present
perfect progressive tense."  But such a thing is a monstrosity.  The
English progressive verb forms are more or less imperfective.  This
would make the verb a "perfective imperfective," which is nonsense,
even if it is acceptable English.  "I have gone to school recently"
would be a more or less perfective, implying that the going is pretty
much over.  I submit that such a mess should never be rendered into a
language like Glosa with a single verb phrase.

Mi pa du ki proxi-tem ad eduka-do e mi ki.

"I was going to school and I am still going."  If one really wanted
to emphasize the continuation of the going, one could, somewhat
redundantly, repeat the 'du' before the second instance of 'ki'.

If preceded by a TMA (tense-mode-aspect) particle, could it be
reduced to just "ge-xxx"? I agree, it was not well-designed.
In "standard" pidgins, TMA particles can all be dropped (which I
don't like ...) but in their absence, the opposite is assumed (IIUC).
So, leaving out "perfect" means "imperfect". I'd much rather have
and use the appropriate particle when desired, and default to nothing.
If nothing better turns up, "pra" is fine wiht me.
It ought to be a single CV syllable if possible.
In fact, I wish the whole project were more consistent
in keeping CV phonology, because it is easiest to learn.

I was very impressed by that, at least a year or 2 ago.
Very good work, both of you. Perhaps we should compare/contrast
some of its features with Glosa. For me, a touch of idealism
in the project is worth a lot (e.g. Zamenhof, vs. Couturat)
though I know you disagree.

Esperanto uses mandatory tense plus a sort of optional aspect
created by using tense a second time ... Ido is a little better
with its perfective infix. Best to clearly separate the functions.

    However, it would seem that in its present state, Glosa can mark
the imperfect with 'du' and has nothing to mark the perfect explicitly.
Ought we to say that if the imperfect is not marked, the perfect is
implied?  Then how do we convey unmarkedness for aspect?

> If nothing better turns up, "pra" is fine wiht me.

    As a combination of both past tense and perfective aspect?  In
which case the issue arises, as you quoted me below, of why merely this
combination?  Why not every conceivable combination under the sun
of tense and aspect having its own distinct particle?  Why not have
just a very few particles marking things separately, so that one can
make one's own combination at need?

    Glosa has some difficulty with its phonological structure based on
its history which would seem to militate against your preference here.
Following its basis in Hogben's Interglossa, Glosa attempts to maintain
some at least vague recognizability of Greco-Latin roots.  This works
-against- strict CV, VCV, and CVCV words consistently.  It appears that
we can't have it both ways (approximate recognizability versus simple
phonological word structure).

    If you want more CVCV word structure, you might take a look at
Barnett Russell's Suma, in which the words are more or less ad hoc but
strongly CVCV (and related).  At one time I was impressed enough with
the general idea of Suma that I thought about trying to work out a
couple of the kinks and generating a new vocabulary (Russell's is
sketchy in spots).  I even wrote a few simple computer programs to
generate and maintain wordlists (and generated 7200 CV, VCV, CVV, and
CVCV possible words based on criteria).

    It might be a sort of Suma-like phonological structure with a
frater2-like grammar.  Suma's (and my) vocabulary would certainly be
"neutral," in that the words are not taken from -any- natlang (barring
accidental coincidences) and therefore would be equally easy or
difficult for just about everyone.  (One problem with this sort of word
structure is delimiting word boundaries, even if one does not go as far
as Lojban, say, with its allegedly self-segregating morphemes.)

    Thank you.  However, even if I ever did complete a working
vocabulary, I would have no illusions about it taking the IAL world
by storm. :-)

    As I have said on AUXLANG, in my exchanges with James Chandler,
there can be competing values involved in a conIAL design which may
not always be entirely compatible, so that something has to give.
That is why I do not accept what I call the Jespersen Criterion as
a trump card over everything else.

    I agree personally that Esperanto is not as easy as some of its
proponents make it out to be.  I have tried several times and have
never really mastered it.  For passive reading, I find Ido to be much
easier, for whatever reason, about the same ease or difficulty as
Interlingua.

    This is slightly off topic, but not entirely so, I would think.  In
my last post (responding to Charles) I mentioned Barnett Russell's
Suma.  I did not mention that he had a somehat ingenious mnemonic
device to assist learning vocabulary, in that vowel alternations partly
indicated part of speech and partly paired (or tripled) off words with
somewhat associated meanings.  But this sort of device simply is not
available to a language like Glosa if it is to keep to its principle
of maintaining some recognizability of Greco-Latin-derived toots.

    But, what does a field look like?
    Is a field a group of related physical objects, viz animals, clothing,
or or is a field an area of human thought, similar to the categories of the
Roget Thesaurus?
    I have had one thought on this, regarding specialised lexicons.  These
are more 'fields of interest' than 'thing fields or 'thought fields'.
    While everyone can write letters home, about their holiday, using
_Glosa 6000_, if that holiday took in attendance at a conference for
Geneticists, then a couple of additional lexicons might be brought into
play.  The letter might use .biology words not in _6000_, and it would use
words from the .genetics lexicon, that are definitely NOT in _6000_.
    This idea, similar to  "import"  in Java programming, suggests that we
'load up' lexicons, additional to the basic, when discussing specialist
interest areas.

    Pease send your definition of a "field".

    My only thought on it was years ago, when I started asking people what
it would take to produce a Glosa "parser."  What you are suggesting sounds
like an extremely simplified parser: is it?  Is the word, "parser" still in
use, or has something replaced it, now?

    And yes, it always was my understanding that Glosa's style of grammar
set it up for streamlined 'parsing'.  This thinking leads into other
"Middle Language" ideas: that Glosa would make an ideal MetaLanguage for
the interaction of people with 'intelligent machines' in international
settings; and, that Glosa, in its most standardised incarnation, already
comprises a 'meaning representation system' that would hold meaning as a
readable 'Intermediate Language' in machine translation.

*   There are distinct parallels, and in Glosa these are closer, in form,
than they are in English.  But aren't you pushing it a bit too far to
suggest 'verbs' are 'nouns'?
    Though you might have discovered a hidden truth: the brain processes
*things*, and the phrases attached to them, in much the same way that it
processes *actions* and their associated phrases.

>The blank prep means subject (no other prep can be elided, not even

norm, and that a tense particle can be seen as a variant of this
preposition.  Hmm!  It sounds like a good theory, but one which must be
tested against the practice of language.  In Glosa no tense particle is
needed for actions in the present, with ~nu~ only needed to stress the
immediate present.

*   Yes, I have tried hard to propose ways of telling the time and date
that give discrimination in both written and spoken forms.  EG
Q.  Qod es u horo?  [What is the time?]
      OR
    Qe, u horo nu es?  [What time is it now?]

A.  Mo horo.  [One.]
      OR
    Id es Mo horo.  [It is One.]
      OR
    Nu es Mo ho'kron.  [It is now One O'clock.]

   In the above sequence, there is no possible confusion - whichever form
of the question and answer is used.  In a 'context-neutral' auditory
situation, such as on radio, people would give the hour its 'label', and
say, ~Id es nu Mo ho'kron.~.  No-one would hear the capitalisation - which
denotes hour, not date - but all listeners would know that it was an hour
of the day, and not a day of the month, because they would hear the
~ho'kron~, which is a contraction of HORO KRON .. intended to flag the ~mo~
as an 'hour in measured time.'
   All we need to do now is work out if Glosa's measured time is in
twenty-four chunks, or if the archaic "Before, and After, Mid-day" system
is to persist.  I think the Twenty-four Hour Clock is in, for us global
moderns: what does the group think?
   Of course, now with a Networked world and e-commerce, we ought to know
that the actual time, specified by a person in one part of the world, is
understood to be the same moment, by a reciever in any another location.
My daughter's suggestion is that, in Cyberspace, we will use GMT.

   Glosa must pass the "Telephone Test".  Unlike the "Turing Test", in
which we must try to determine if we are speaking to a machine or person on
the other end of the line, in the 'Telephone Test' we know we are talking
to a human, but we want to be sure that we really can ^picture^ what they
are saying.  EG
  [Ring-ring]
  B. Bil ci; Carli, es tu?
  C. Ja, mi es Carli.
  B. Qe, na enkontro qod horo, datu, e loka?
  C. Ah!
  B. Ja, kron e lo?
  C. Na fu unio to Mo-bi ho'kron, datu tri-mo u-ci meno, infra u horo-me
      intra Centra Parka.

   So, Carli and Bil make their arangements, unequivocally, by phone.
   I hope that you can follow their conversation without referring to the
dictionary.  If however, there are any questions in your mind, please
submit your translation: prizes might be distributed for correct entries.

   On the other side of town, Maria and Beti are arranging a meeting for
some months hence,  EG

  M. ...... so tu habe id, ne enkontro bi meno po nu: homo loka, homo horo,
datu tri, Meno tetra.
  B. Ja mi ski: ci, u-ci horo, u Tri de Meno-tet.

   Again, what Maria and Beti say passes the Telephone Test.

This is hardly a confusion in Glosa, even if, in English, they might all
ret down to "that".
    This is more a confusion of English not Glosa!  I will agree that one
cannot hear the semicolon, and this is my reason for wishing to rediscover
the Old Glosa ~ke~, which can be heard.  Whilst experimenting with this
situation, which in my mind is still the "LOGICAL THAT", I attempted to use
~ xxx: ~ when the authors consigned ~ke~ to the linguistic dustbin, and I
feel that it did give more of the right feeling than the semi-colon.  But
this experimental use is 'Robin Glosa' and though logically better, is
neither Kosher, nor audible.
    As in the English-language usage of "that" {third line up, third word
back}, no punctuation was used, nor seemed necessary, viz ".. feel that it
..", I was probably introducing a Noun Clause.  What is a Noun Clause
marker in Glosa, apart from the semicolon, which the authors have chosen to
be the generic clause marker?
    Some time back, still using ~ke~ - before it was relegated - I found
that some times it felt right to use a semicolon (or colon) before it and
other times it did not.  Possibly, it was when starting an Adverbial
Clause, that I felt no need for punctuation; and, before the Noun Clause, a
colon seemed apt.
Present Situation in Glosa:-

    Admittedly, this does bring in two usages of the out-dated ~ke~
differentiated, in text, by the presence or absence of the colon, and, in
speech, by vocal inflection.
    I think the authors 'borrowed' the idea of KE from Esperanto, but then
subsequently felt embarrassed about this, and decided no clause marker
particle was needed, after all, for Adverbial and Noun Clauses.

    I invite other Glosalistas to suggest ammendments to either of these
lists: present or possible.

    Indeed.  And such natlang confusion should not be smuggled into a
constructed auxlang.

    Provided we do not overload 'ke' with the multiple functions which
"that" bears in English.

    Vocal inflection is very, very, very, very problematic in an
auxlang which will have many diverse adult learners.  Based on their
native tongues, what seems like a "natural" vocal inflection to one
may seem confusing or even bizarre to another.  I recommend that we
do not depend on vocal inflections to make ourselves clear.

    This has been my point all along.

    Not really.  I do not "blame" languages at all, as they are merely
"things," so to speak.  Any problems in the end lie with designers.

> and, unless he gives examples of this, I feel the case is not yet proven.

    You gave an example yourself above, using 'ke' in one instance to
introduce a noun clause and in another to introduce an adverbial
clause.  As charles has pointed out, clause marking is rather vague
(my term) in Glosa.  Why should two types of clauses be marked the same
way merely because they are sometimes so marked in English?  It's too
bad that we don't have some non-native-Anglophones (preferably those
who are even native speakers of non-Indo-European tongues) among us.

    Like most natlangs, English teems with illogicalities.

    Yes, and one aspect of that is to avoid semantic overloading.

The idea of semicolon for relative pronoun is a failure.  If the language is a
real language, and the original "authors"  are *just* authors now, the semicolon
usage can be dropped.

>>> Again, how does one speak a semicolon?

The use of commas to indicate pauses in speech, especially to mark the
boundaries of phrases, is so obvious as to need no justification.  The use of
"KE" should be as "U" in that the speaker may use it or elide it as seems most
appropriate.  Most clear would be to use both, together.

Actually, I don't understand the difference between "QI" and "KE".

The way the web page would work, there would be a fixed format "form", and when
"submitted" a Perl script would run and generate some kind of translated text
results, and send that back as a generated web page. The actual Perl script
could also run stand-alone on one's PC. I think there is a Perl for Micro$soft
win95 and possibly even win3.1 ... The script could be translated into C, I
suppose, but I just don't bother with C anymore.

Yes, but simple and intuitive, useful to a beginner. Colors, animals, plants;
qualities and abstractions; "verboids" and other common actions or relations;
places and directions and body parts; all prepositions and grammatical words.
The trick is to NOT try to partition words so they are in only one category.

My theory on organizing a lexicon is to make ALL grammatical particles 2
letters, consonant-vowel; ALL common base vocabulary words 4 letters, CVCV; and
ALL extended vocabulary 6 or more letters, CVCVCV ... New learners and machine
parsers would be eternally grateful.

    However, I opine that such a language would no longer be Glosa, as
it would involve too much further deformation of roots.  Somewhere
along the line, Ashby & Clark changed Interglossa so much that it was
no longer Interglossa but a different language, Glosa.  At some point,
enough deformation would result in yet another language.  That does not
make the attempt wrong.  (As I mentioned, I kind of like Russell's CV,
CVV, and CVCV language Suma.)  But it would be another auxlang, just as
Ido is another auxlang, no matter how much its advocates try --
unwisely, in my opinion -- to call it "reformed Esperanto."

    'Qi' is unambiguously (?) either a relative or interrrogative
pronoun.  "Ke' is who-knows-what at this point, but I am not aware
that it has ever been intended as a relative in the same manner.

Well, you would be right. So I only advocate applying the "theory" to Glosa to
the extent of making no changes further away from this direction; as it is,
Glosa follows it 90%, which is pretty good. It is too late to change the
relatively few grammatical particles that are non-CV, but new specialized
vocabularies could still adhere to the CVCV... pattern.

    Hope I can negotiate the unzipping.  I will need to print out the file,
or, perhaps, put it on the now moribund 386.
    Mystified about the _Glosa 1000_ words not in the G-E version: they
might have been from other '1000' lists; I laboriously collapsed all of the
Glosa words in the two lists in the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary into one
composite list.
    Will probably allocate time to browse your site, Bill, on Sunday.

Subject: Head Down: 6000 --> 2500
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Sat, 13 Feb 99 02:3

Hello Friends,
   Apologies for my absence from the cyberways, but I have been
concentrating hard on refining down the _Glosa 6000_ to something more
Nettable.  So far, I am mostway through on my second pass: in the first, I
separated out obvious duplications and abstruse forms; in this pass, I am
restricting the vocabulary even more - in the search for that elusive
optimum Net-Dic.

  Which reminds me of a piece of Glosa Lore.  Once, while talking to Ron
Clark, I said, "I know how hard you have been working - deriving the
vocabulary."  Ron replied immediately: "No you don't."
  Feeling put out, as well as mystified, I asked him to give me some idea
of how hard he had been working .. so he told me the following story.
Once, while sitting at his desk compiling the vocabulary, with about six
national language dictionaries arranged, fan-like around him, and
concentrating hard on finding the commonality among them, a knock came at
the door.  He opened the door, heard the visitor announce himself, and then
attempted to answer.  No meaningful sentence came: what emerged was just a
meaningless string of words and sounds from the compilation work he had
been doing.  I did observe that very few people pushed their brains to that
extent of concentration, and agreed that I had not been fully aware of how
hard he had been working on dictionary formation.

   I am not working as hard as that on the Net Dictionary: if I really
screw up my mind, and concentrate hard, I might approach about one
hundredth of this mind-blowing level of concentration.  But, I've been
doing my best.
   Thinking co-operatively, I have decided to concentrate my efforts on
cutting down Glosa, which I do know, while inviting others, who have better
knowledge of other languages, such as Ido, Esperanto and Interlingua, to
help by checking my work against existing "Lite" versions of these other
languages .. noting glaring omissions in the double filtered version of
'Glosa Lite' that I come up with.

   My criteria during the filtration process have been very simple - I
trust that a third pass through the list, culling even harder, is not
necessary.
 - savagely cutting out synonyms, leaving only one as the selected version,
 - deciding on close concepts, where two different, but close, words seem
warrented,
 - providing a working vocabulary with which people can write passable
letters in Glosa,
 - mainly giving people all the various nuts and bolts of Glosa so they can
experiment with all of the different Glosa forms, as a training vocabulary,
 - trying hard to ensure that there was a token content of substantives to
cover daily activities like eating, dressing, shopping, and taking the dog
for a walk.

   I might ship the list to the Glosalist with a side listing of
near-misses.  I had to be very hard on myself in this culling process, and
moved possible selections to the side, so that I could consider them for a
while, before deleting them from view.  I was thinking of two distinctly
different target populations, while deciding whether, or not, to leave
words or delete them: urbane Neticens and pristine Third Worlders.  This
might explain some uneven-ness in the Glosa Lite I will be posting in a
couple of days.

   Will post this, now.  Writing this has provided a necessary unwinding
for me .. during the process of vocab selection: if I tried too hard, and
ended up spouting nonsense sylables, there is a danger that, at my age, I
might not be able to click back.

   Also, will read and reply to recent posts that have piled up while I've
been at it, a.s.a.p.

Saluta,
 Robin

    ALIENA - "strange, estrange"; last A clipped due to following vowel
    ABILI - "ability, able"; used also as an 'abstract noun' category
       post-fix
    >hyphens used for tight compounding of concepts.
Thus,  ~no-alien-abili~  translates to  "un -estrange -able".
  3. ~plu ...... privilegi~  [rights]
  4. The whole statement is pitched at the level of abstracts, so I
grounded it by using the simple substantives: in a normal sentence, I might
not have been happy with ~funda~ for "foundation", but to avoid making the
whole phraseology ^top-heavy^, I avoided using compounds for these abstract
nouns.
  5. In English the second "of" is called for by usage; but it really does
not help the flow of this long-winded and awkward phrasing, so, a
corresponding ~de~ in the Glosa rendition was omitted in the name of
*understanding*.  At the start, I could not seem to gather all of the
concepts, referred to, within one idea; however, when I dropped the second
~de~ the ^conceptual space^ did not seem to be too overloaded.
  6. Such stilted use of language really does look like a confidence trick
to me: it is a string of well-sounding phrases and concepts, which suggest
benefit to people, but which is hardly worth the letters it is written with.
  &&&. I cannot actually say that my rendition, here is a good example of
Glosa; but, at least it works, and I was happy that there were no
difficulties with the vocabulary.

   What does the panel think?

    Translation is always a difficult and even problematic matter.
In fact, I think there is even an entire Usenet newsgroup dedicated
to the subject (and problems) of translation.

    The problem I see with Robin's effort is the old word-for-word
bugaboo of translation.  I recommend that in order for the result to
be clear and smooth Glosa, something more along the line of a Glosa
paraphrase or gloss may be better than trying to come up with Glosa
equivalents for specific English words, such as 'whereas'.

*   Suspect so, too, but sometimes people need some meaningful referrent:
if an import comes from a country, we could use the Internet Country Code EG,
 'larakin'[au] OR [au]'larakin'; and if the import is from a whole
language, we might find a similar, but non-clashing code EG,
'Saionara'[Nip] OR [Nip]'Saionara'.

    You left out the pauses.  " - " is for brief parenthetic ones; while
" . . . " for mega-pauses, leads down through " ... " to " .. " for pauses
called for by context.  There is also, I suspect, a an un-signed pause that

Tense from Aspect in Glosa:-

   Tense Particles: PA [past], FU [future] - no present.

   Aspect Particles: PROTO [start], SIO [condional], DU [continuous],
PARATO or PRAE [perfective], NU [immediate;recent;imanent], and RE- or
ITERA [repetitive].

    As a primary school child - aged ten - I was introduced to Parsing and
analysis,and this has sustained my interest in communication ever since.
    I think that when the IAL is in, we will need to give school pupils
instruction in "good IAL style."  Then people will learn from the start
that IAL equivalents of "have heard" are poetic uses of language, and they
will also learn the mechanics of good communication.
    Last time I fielded this idea on Conlang, I was accused of wanting to
tell people how to think, and accused of being a Fascist.

    From Old Glosa I recall using PARATO [already]: by abstraction
(removing A-TO), we can derive the PRA, which seemed, to you, like the
illegitemate product of an unholy marriage between Tense and Aspect.
    Maybe the uncut PARATO is the missing Perfective Aspect Particle; it
comes directly from Latin, but is no-where in the current Glosa
dictionaries.  Oh, yes, did I mention PRAE [before] is in _Glosa 6000_?

*   I reply to this Post in full, because I am Forwarding it to the Glosa
authors for adjudication, or whatever it is they do, when they lay down a
recommendation.
 ------------------------------------
So, Hello Ron, Wendy & Glosalistas ,
    Have we got the Passive Voice sewn up, and is it  ~es ge-X~ [is Xed],
  as Paul reports?
    And is there now a "Perfective Particle" which tells us that something
   is well and truly done with?

    Perhaps I am still using Old Glosa, with ~gene ge-X~ [gets Xed], and
~id pra acide~ [it had happened]?

    Even though I like GENE ["to get"], while Paul does not, I believe that
there is a very strong case for breaking the "is" complex into the original
four variants - ES, GENE, HABE, EQA - that I learnt about some years ago.
So, for me, when the dog bites the man, the man definitely _gets_ bitten by
the dog!  The substantive operating as a full 'verb' is the GENE, while
participle status is conferred on the substantive MORDA
by the GE- prefix.
    Am I being a recidivist, on this, or just plain logical?

  U kani morda un andra.  [The dog bites the man.]  ..... Active Voice

  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani. [The man gets bitten by the dog.] P.V.

  Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.* [The man IS* bitten by the dog.] ??

   Just because years of usage have extended the "is" to precede the
Passive form, does not make it correct communication: this is one of the
things about English usage that I believe should NOT be generalised into
the IAL!

    On the Perfective, I was very happy with PRA, which seems to have
disappeared from the Glosa word-lists and dictionaries.  I did find PRAE
[before] in _Glosa 6000_, but the perfect Perfective, PRA, appears to have
evaporated.
    Is there an alternative particle to allow us to tell the difference
between the idea that something _has_ begun and the thought that it _had_
begun, or, in Glosa, does this distinction not matter?  EG

  U komiti pa komence id unio. [The committee has begun its meeting.]

  U komiti pra komence id unio, kron M. Peters pa arive te voka an kredi;
un unio pa es no-konstitu.
  [The committee had begun its meeting, when Mr Peters arrived to announce
his belief: the meeting was unconstituional.]

   Old Glosa again?  What is the New Glosa for "had", or is there none?

Saluta,
 Robin G.

gets used to it.  Note that originally Glosa had no Passive Voice.

*   Thank you for telling us what the 'world standard' is.  I have seen the
date given .. backwards .. before, but did not know why.

    One question is whether the Glosa group, if it were to insist on a
YYYY.MM.DD date format, would be in the vanguard of cultural development,
or would be seen to be pushing an, as yet unaccepted, "Standard".

year or two here or there and a day or two there or here.

*   If it is "official", and will be in place for the majority of the
coming millenium, then it should be Glosa!
    But, for the 'hard of hearing' I do prefer the "(YY)YY" option: so I
see 2001.01.03 - or 03.01.2001 - as being much more useful in the first
decade of the new period than either 01.01.03 or 03.01.01.

   I would, however, psychologically feel happier with the Old Fashioned ...
    Di-Penta, 3 Mo 01 , which is on a rising plane of duration size .

   N.B. All of the above comments relate only to the WRITTEN form of the date.

on the telephone, on radio, on T.V., or simply in conversation?

*   I can follow the chronometer "time" idea trailing off, like long decimals, into digits of insignificance.  But the ancient timekeeping system of "Suns", "Moons" and "Nights" long preceded our decimalisation of time, and might continue for many suns, to come.

    Only computerised equipment ^worries^ about clock-times with xx:xx:xx accuracy; most humans are happy if the get the hour right, let alone the minute, as in "I sent the letter Yesterday".

    Such a point in time, as the one you sign off with, might be conventionalised one day to:  990131:100000 .  Happily I won't be around then.

    I do not suggest that we specify a moment .. starting with its decimalised part of a second, either, EG 000010:310199 .  But I do wonder if the I.S.O. building has been taken over by robots (or computers).


    My guess is that 90% of humanity still counts time by the "Nights/Moons/Suns" system.  I believe that Glosa is for these people, too.

    My feeling, however, is that when specificity fails, descriptiveness
should take over.  How do they compare:-
  Bi-tri miliona mero de un Amp.  ...........  23/1000000 A
  Punkta ze-ze-ze-ze-bi-tri de un Amp.  .....  0.000023 A

  U bi-tri miliona mero de un Amp.  .........  23 . 1/1000000 A
  Bi-tri mikroAmp.  .........................  23 mikroA

    My dictionary carries all of the prexfixes, symbols and values for
Metric prefixes, from 10^18 to 10^-18, if anyone would like them.

There are only two Tense particles: PA [past], FU [future] - (no present).

There are six Aspect particles: PROTO [start], SIO [condional], DU

and RE- or ITERA [repetitive].

N.B. Getting very trick, we can discover that Aspect particles can be

combined, EG  Pa fu dice [was to have spoken],
Fu pa dice [will have spoken].

***************************
    Once, in Old Glosa, there was PARATO [already], which is straight from
the Latin.  Through contraction (removal of A-TO), the aforementioned PRA
[had] can be derived from this. EG

  Un unio pa parato komence. [The meeting had already begun.]
   ..... did already begin

  Un unio pra komence.  [The meeting had begun.]

Which is best?  Is ~pra~ an allowable contraction of the Past particle and
Perfective particle into one form, or, for standardisation, would it be
better to resurrect ~parato~ and leave ~pra~ in the O.G. file?  Note that
the two different Glosa sentences above, have the same English-language
meaning.
   Somehow, I suspect that Glosa works, and does so differently from other
languages ... possibly innovatively, and better!  Should the O.G. ~parato~
be revived to become the Perfective Element that we are seeking?
 ##############################
For similar reasons, on the "Repetitive" front, I feel that the separate
particle ITERA [again] is better than the prefix RE- [repeated] which would
add an inconsistency to the pattern.

Some say that Esperanto is sexist because it uses -in- to make a feminine
noun from the masculine/epicene root. I say that *if* it is sexist, it is
so for a quite different reason: men must share the root with women in the
epicene and have no infix to call their own. Why should women enjoy such
preferential treatment?

Yes, that was slightly tongue in cheek.

But why did this come to mind? Well, the situation seems similar to me.
By omitting "mile", do we offend backwards (Shhh. I'm a US citizen, so I
can say that.) countries like the United States? Or would inclusion of
"mile" instead be preferential treatment for the US and such? I think the
latter.

The alternative would require, in fairness, unique words for units of all
systems. Maybe the omission of "mile" in the International Language will
help to drag the US, kicking and screaming, into the 18th century.

Cool! I've been using YYYY.MM.DD for at least a couple of decades now, and
I recently came across that ISO standard on the Web, the only difference
being that they suggest '-' rather than '.'. Looks like they have finally
caught up with me!

    Robin, sorry for the seemingly harsh words, but do you understand
the difference between tense and aspect?  You are still asking your
question of "has begun" and "had begun" in terms of the English verb
system, which blends and/or confuses tense and aspect.  "Has begun,"
despite being called (rather mistakenly) a "(present) perfect tense,"
has more of a tense which is both past and present because the aspect
is more or less imperfective (despite the name), inasmuch as the action
can be considered ongoing (it began and is still going on).  "Had
begun" is a past tense with something of a perfective aspect, inasmuch
as with respect to the time reference, the action is no longer
characterized as continuing.  The English verb system is a real mess,
and I think you are letting your native-speaker habits lead you astray.
I have heard adult learners of English as a second language struggle
with the monstrosity of English verbs.

    Conditional is a mood, neither an aspect nor a tense.  Again, our
abominable English verb system (and some of the school teaching that

    If other verb particles are short, 'parato' would seem to be a bit
long to me.

    In my opinion, no.  Tense and aspect should be marked separately if
they are marked at all.  Why blend only a single combination of tense
and aspect into one particle?  There is no more justification for this
than for inventing hybrid particles for every possible combination of
tense, aspect, mood, and voice.  (Maybe Glosa verbs should have three
voices, as in classical Greek, complete with medial and passive
deponents.)

    Not everyone is yet so optimistic about the present state of the
Glosa verb system, which seems too much to mimic the absurdities of
English.  We really do need Glosa to be worked over by a native speaker
of a non-Indo-European language WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENGLISH.  I fear that
English habits are leading native speakers astray.

Paul,
   Thank you for being so firm about tense and aspect.  Glosa does
indeed have the serious deficit of being supported mainly by English
speakers, especially ones who cannot step outside of it and see the
horrid mess that the English tense system has become in the last several
centuries. I truly wish we had a non-English speaking Russian involved in
it, or a Chinese who would brush the whole thing (pardon the pun) under
the rug!

*   Is either the book, or the usage of English, in error?
    I still lean in favour of the language, and suspect that the book is
using an impefect system of analysis.
    But, yes, Glosa should have rules of usage to ensure that the timing of
the action(s) is teased out a bit, and not all in a clump.

    Things would have been easier if the phantom RECENTO [recent(ly)],
that I even remember using, was in the dictionary where I thought it was.
_Glosa 6000_ gives "recently" NU PA.   Perhaps it would be best to locate
such 'adverbs' at the start of the sentence, when they modify a 'verb' with
mixed tense.  EG
         Nu pa, mi pa du ki ad eduka-do.
 glos: recent past, I did continue to go to (the) learning building
      [Recently, I have been going to school.]

Or, to add the extra information that I am still continuing to attend
school, it needs to be spelled out, as Paul does, below.  Otherwise, the
first sentence leaves us in some doubt.  EG
         Nu pa, mi pa du ki ad eduka-do, e mi du ki.
        [Recently, I have been going to school, and am still going.

*   Agreed,
      This is the reason for the Glosa team's working at the applied level
in Third World countries, as well as on the EC reference their translation
costs.
      People in the English-speaking world percieve no serious problem, and
have no 'leverage' to persue global communication at a level higher that
that of English.  But Asia and Africa do have very serious language
problems now; and, effort put into demonstrating Glosa's effectiveness in
these areas will be greatly rewarded.  Hence my .. as yet unsuccessful ..
attempt to find - through the Net - other Affluents who will correspond, in
Glosa, with Third Worlders.

     However, to write to people in Africa or Asia, we need to be using a
stable language: this explains the reason for trying to remove
inconsistencies from the Glosa dictionaries, and for tying to find a
practical way of demonstrating the fundamentals of Glosa grammar.  It also
explains why Paul Bartlett and I are loathe to suggest adding neologisms to
Glosa.

     But "Apologism" for the IAL hypothesis has a very long history, and
although I would like to add my title, "Glosa: A Model for the
International Auxiliary Language", to the list, I am having trouble just
keeping up with e-mail and correspondence with Third Worlders.

     Again, I would urge subscribers to the Glosalist to develop their
skills, of writing Glosa, to the level where they can join the pidgeon post
correspondence network.

*   Think I've got it: rather than the absence of a particle implying an
opposite, it would be better if the absence just meant that the particular
Tense or Aspect is not intended.  (Does IIUC mean the assumption of the
opposite situation to the one omitted?)
   Example - even in English - do make thing easier for me to follow.

>If nothing better turns up, "pra" is fine wiht me.
*   Recently, I looked hard and found both PRAE and PARATO: though I prefer
the feel of PARATO, it does not satisfy your desire for a one-sylable CV
particle.  Paul doesn't like PRA because it was originally a one-word blend
of Past Tense and Perfective Aspect.
    If it was relegated to Perfective Aspect only, this would give the Past
Perfect as PA PRA, and this feels wrong to me, while PA PARATO rolls off
the tongue satisfyingly.

PARATO [already], AND ITERA [again].
    Where would we find CV syllables that are derivationally sound and not
already in the lexicon?  Also, if we attempted to abbreviate the last
three, we would lose their etymological basis.
    I actually prefer these longer forms, which sound good on their own, or
with PA or FU; alternatively, if we relegated PRA from being a combined
Tense-Aspect particle [=had] to simply being an Aspect particle
[=previously], then the Past Perfect form would be PA PRA [did previously],
which would sound more like a stutter than two distinct words.

*   Paul does sum up the compromise situation beween form and derivation.

    The triangle of linguistic elements working inside Glosa, as I see it,
is:-
  % Greco-Latin lexical source-words,
  % Pronunciation of these words, close to current usage of derivatives,
  % Spelling that captures both Classical source and present phonetic
pronunciation.

  The best example I can give is ~skience~
 = It looks like the modern English word "science".
 = And is close to the Latin source-word ^scientia^.
 = The Latin ^sciens^ [knowing] was probably pronounced with a hard "C",
and had the "I" and the "E" marked for separate pronunciation.

  This comes down to a pronunciation: skEE'AYn-CHAY

*   We seem to have two main problems in Glosa inherited with the "that"s
from English: there is the form of the word that we use to translate at
least four different usages of "that"; and there is the question of a vocal
inflection that varies with the different "that" functions.

rules, and that second generation users of an IAL, like Glosa, will develop
the associated inflections, that go with the language, I acknowlege that we

inflection.

etymological claim to serve as a clause marker for one of these?
   As it stands, there is only one Glosa equivalent of "that" with double
function: KE.  If a suitable alternative cannot be found for one of these
usages, rather than introduce another odd word, I would feel that such

This is somewhat true. But still, whenever there is a necessity to
coin a new word or even a new grammatical structure, as would happen
if a perfective aspect were added, as it *should* be, then (now) is
a good time to TRY to follow "idealistic meta-principles" such as

1. CV for particles and affixes
2. CVCV or CVCVCV for substantives

Or, as nearly as possible. While I'm at it, ...

3. minimal number of verbs/verboids/auxiliaries
4. topicalized dictionary (grouped semantic fields).

For all peoples universally, CV syllables are easiest.
To maximally distinguish grammatical from content words,
the only method available in modern Glosa is length.

Assuming the language catches on to the extent of having
a speaking community, all rules go out the window anyway.
And it's too late to recast Glosa's existing deviant words.

So once again, I'm recommending aspiration to better principles
whenever possible, but be practical about when to make-do with
what is. Perfection is unattainable, but the opposite is avoidable.

The Graeco-Latin pattern is not untouchable; current Glosa is
far enough from recognizability that a *little* more mangling
wouldn't hurt. In fact, the Frater project, which I regard as
a close, uh, relation to Glosa, has gone much further in that
direction, with no ill effects, i.e. it looks OK and would work.

THAT item #3 just needs a colon excision.

Item #4 is an idiom THAT needs to be banned from usage.
Re-phrase as "then" or "causing".

Commas are very simply and universally *pauses*, and should not
be futzed with. Hogben introduced the weird semicolon and colon,

cultures uniformly use vocal inflections the same way?  I do not have
hard data, but I am very, very, very, very skeptical, to say the least.
I am of the opinion that at least in the beginning, a conIAL should
bend over backwards in -not- depending on vocal inflections to convey
-anything-.

    Once again, how do you speak a comma or semicolon?  If you say they
represent some sort of pauses or vocal inflections, then we are back to
the same problem.  At least Lojban has "verbal punctuation" and
attitudinals so that it can be -spoken- in a uniform monotone and still
convey what needs to be said.

    I do not appreciate it at all.  "Get" has so many and such
nefarious uses that I recommend that it be omitted from all further
discussions of the Glosa verb system.  It does not even seem to be used
consistently among various dialects of English (for instance, I do not
seem to use it as Robin does), so how can we even use it to discuss?

    What "rolls off the tongue satisfyingly" is such an individual
matter that I do not consider it a relaible criterion.

    SIO marks a mood, not an aspect, and I thought the discussion was
around only two aspects, not six.

    This is something of the bugaboo with Glosa purporting to have
Greco-Latin roots.

    "Previously" would mark a tense, not an aspect.  Really, we do need
to get this tense/aspect/mood matter straight if we are to be taken
seriously and if Glosa is to be used by non-Indo-European peoples (or
even just non-English-speaking peoples).

    I recommend that the phrase/name "Tense Table" be scrapped
entirely.  Refer to it as a "verb table."  Again, confusion arises from
the English verb system and the way it may often be taught to children
(even in the otherwise very good grammar-school education I had in the
midwestern US in the 1950s).

    I think it's a little bit of both.  Because the English verb system

    There is a problem with this scheme parsing word boundaries in a
speech stream.  One could go into details on it, and it is part of the
problem that the Lojban designers faced, even at the expense of CV
alternation.

> Or, as nearly as possible. While I'm at it, ...

    Actually, I foresee a need for so few additional grammatical
function words that I really doubt that the "idealistic
meta-principles" would make much difference in the case of Glosa.

> 3. minimal number of verbs/verboids/auxiliaries

    My opinion is that the current complement is not excessive.
However, I think that the term "verboid" should be dropped as
essentially meaningless, even if Hogben did use it and A&C copied
his usage.

    This is merely a lexicographical matter that could be addressed
with different available word lists.

within the current structure to make much difference.

    Unfortunately, I think that Glosa has done quite a bit of mangling..
I have at least some familiarity with Greco-Latin roots and English
etymology, and I have had trouble with some of Glosa's mangled words.
I am tending to think that Hogben may have had it better within the
assumptions he was working with.

    Are you referring to the original Lingua Sistemfrater of the 1950s?
Actually, it had quite a few consonant clusters and closed syllables,
possibly too many for your taste.  If I had more or less completed
vocabulary for my frater2, my original intention had been to stick
somewhat to the Greco-Latin design of both Interglossa and Frater,
neither of which would meet the CV/CVV/VCV/CVCV criterion.

    As I have mulled it over, I probably would not complete frater2
as it stands.  If I were to do further work, I would probably blend
frater2's grammar with something like Suma's word and vocabulary
structure and scrap so-called recognizabilty (which would make things
more allegdly "neutral" anyway).  Recently I used a program I wrote to
generate words.  However, I have not yet given a lot of consideration
to the word boundary (speech stream parsing) problem that can arise
with certain fixed syllable structures.

    I may being doing less in the auxlang world in coming times.  For
the last six years I have not worked due to ill health, but I may soon
be going back to work, in which case I will have less time for other
pursuits.

*   Not too sure if the "new learners" would all be ecstatic, especially if
they were aware of the original vocabulary from which the *regularised*
lexicon had been extracted.  It sounds more like CyberGlosa than a version
of Glosa, but could catch the popular imagination more than the
linguistically rational, Glosa, has.

    However, being much more suitable for machine handling, such a
CyberGlosa would get a lot further a lot quicker, as a "Meta-language" for
man-machine interfaces using limited lexicons, than has the 'humanistic'
Glosa.

    I will agree that such a parsable ^Nu-type^ language could be what the
world has been waiting for, but I ask about the feasibility of such a
project and the 'lead-time' it would need.  I wonder when the world will be
ready to make use of such a readily machine-handleable communication medium.
    In very practical terms, Clark is over 80, and I top 60; so,
considering that I have got this far with Glosa in twenty years, and that
Clark and Ashby are unlikely to give such a project either time, or their
blessing, how many more years of my life would be needed, if I was to help
CyberGlosa get off the ground?  And considerably more importantly, how many
genuine ACTIVISTS would you need to muster, to gain a critical mass of
developers?

    I imagine that such a project would need its own Mailing List, and
would attract its own coterie of enthusiasts .. who would have different
psychological leanings from the, more 'humanist', Glosa supporters.
Meanwhile,
after clearing the screen of Glosalist postings needing "Reply"s, I move to
the writing desk to answer a letter, in Glosa, from Leonard Sekibaha, in
Tanzania: Leonard is a representative of the vast majority of mankind .. in
the Third World.

    Charles, please post the proposal for a regularised, specifically
machine-handleable derivative of Glosa on this List.
 a. Would you be able to run (moderate) a special Mailing List for it?
 b. Do we know of a suitable Net ISP that would host such a site?
 c. What size of regularised lexicon (which I will subsequently call the
"e-Lex") would such a start-up require to allow functional research?
 d. What would be the guidelines for abstracting an e-Lex from the Clasical
Glosa roots?
 e. How much time would be budgetted for this process, and how much for the
subsequent 'parser' testing of the e-Lex?
 f. Would commercial safeguards be needed, such as copyright and the
payment of royalties - hopefully 0.5% to Richmond, UK - as well as
sponsorship arrangements?
 g. What sort of response, of genuine activists, would you expect from the
Net for such a project: it would possibly need a Net News location and
Website as well as a Mailing List address?

    So far there are two supporters: you and me.  I would definitely have
to make room for the Toshiba luggable at work, if I was to Glosa and
CyberGlosa, as well.  But I could not take a leading role in it: my prime
committment is still to Glosa.

Saluta,
 Robin G.
   P.S. My original proposal for specialist lexicons is still firmly rooted
in the idea of 'humanist', hand-written and spoken language .. but with
computer database backup.

Basically the AdjC is inserted in the middle of the Prime Clause:
 The woman (who is going around the corner) is my neighbour.
=The woman, who is going around the corner, is my neighbour.
~U gina; qi du ki peri u gona, es mi para-pe.

>The woman; who is going round the       U gina; qi ki peri gono; es

IE
 The woman, who is going round the       U gina; qi du ki peri u gona,
   corner, is my neighbour.                es mi para-fe.

>  Wouldn't it be much better to say (and write):

*   I guess (that) you are 'forcing' a "that" here with the ~ke~.
    Also you are attempting to avoid the ^nesting^ of of the AdjC, but it
is still there in the middle of the sentence, after all; and you are making
the second part of the Prime Clause look like a separate mini-sentence, by
invoking the Personal Pronoun, ~fe~, rather than use the Relative Pronoun,
~qi~.  It does sound more pidgin-like, but does not split the main sentence
into two separate mini-sentences.  Possibly ...

 ~U-la gina ki peri u gona; fe es mi para-fe.~
[That woman goes round the corner; she is my neighbour.]

 ... maintains a "that", but one of a ^different colour^, while giving the
full 'pidgin' flavour of two mini-sentences.

   I reckon the *creole* generation of (Glosa) IAL-speakers would
automatically come up with the ^nested^ structure using the Relative Pronoun.

It should *not* be a huge undertaking though, just an addition to
what is already in Paul's glosaref web page (which he got the idea of
from someone previous). At the SIL site there is a set of
"field study" notes that describes something like this for natlangs:

I think all that is needed is some very *minimal* tweaking,
nothing major as you appear to be thinking here. A consistent use
of existing particles would make machine parsing much easier,
and perhaps a *very few* added particles like "perfective"
would help humans more than machines. Also, the current
dictionary project will be a great help to all.

> Charles, please post the proposal for a regularised, specifically

If I was to get off my butt, I'd write a Glosa chatterbot.
There are several implementation options which need not be exclusive:
1. Pure CGI/Perl on a web page with a type-in form interface
2. Java applet that can run disconnected from the net
3. Standalone Perl program for some software platforms

What would it do? Be a conversational Glosa translator of sorts.
It would have the 2.5k Glosa net dictionary embedded in it,
and ask the user to clarify whatever it could not parse.
And maybe after editing it, optionally upload the message to a
web-page bulletin-board, or just read messages others have left.

That's a somewhat do-able idea, open-ended enough to add some
fun features to maintain interest. Hmm, such an idea must have
been tried before. ???

Hello Friends,
  This is Friday 26th Feb, and I resend the GLOSLITE.NET file again, but
this time in six bits .. estimated to be around 20K each .. hoping they are
below the maximum length for emails accepted by Brown University.
 ----------------------------------Ko mi plu digita ge-kruci, Robin------

Friends,  (From original "Bounced" message of two weeks ago.)
   Here, at last, is the working model of the "Glosa Net Dictionary",
which, as a 'work in progress' I have called the GLOSLITE.NET file.
 (1) It is in two columns: only the left column is included in the count,
which, by a pure fluke, was almost exactly <2500>; the words in the right
column are the near misses, or words that might perhaps have been included
in a starter vocabulary, but, for reasons of parsimony, weren't.
 (2) No serious adding of "Omitted" words has occurred; nor have I slowed
down long enough to check out the sorting which has occurred between
similar words and meanings on the Glosalist - apart from what my memory
retained.
 (3) Because this is not yet a refined list, I have not spent time
nit-pickingly removed of the informational ",G."s telling that the words
are of Greek origin.
 (4) Likewise, the white-space within the two parts of a definition have
not been filled (EG.  OPUS a work  -->  OPUS a_work).
 (5) When .. and if .. I get the nod from participants on this list, that
the GLOSLITE.NET file is a suitable 'median' position to work from, in the
formation of a _Glosa Net Dictionary_, aka "GLOSA 2.5K", then I will get on
with the topping and tailing operations: removing  ,G.s  and
putting in the necessary '_' white-space fillers.
 (6) Using the reasonably poweful Macro scripting of Galaxy word processor,
I can "reverse" the lists and generally strip unwanted columns: making each
side of the entries a single string
   EG,  XXXXX_XX_XXXX xx_xxx,xxx(xxx_xx)
 allows better handling of the entries than if spaces are left in them;
I do not know if such form standardisations are helpful to people using
different text-handling methods.  Please send feedback.
 (7) The words on the right hand side can be omitted to keep "GLOSA 2.5K"
within bounds, and Net-pliant.  Please let me know if this GLOSLITE file is
too long for your email program to handle: if members of the Glosalist find
the file does not come through, I will strip the R.H.S. column and resend
as a shorter Attachment, to see if such a reduction makes any significant
difference.

   After this, maybe I can get back to the normal answering of email.

Hurrying to work.

Saluta,
 Robin

&   Thank you for the thoughtful reply.  Part of the problem comes from the authors' amateurism in marketting methods.  Had they tested the water on the statement: GLOSA HAS NO GRAMMAR, they would never have tried this oversimplification of the truth.  They are still using the statement, even though I have asked for it to be removed.

&   I will agree that terminology is a real B*** in linguistics.  I have not heard the terms 'Predicate' and 'Co-ordinator' used in these ways before.  To the average man in the street, and even the average Auxiliary Language enthusiast, I feel that something as painfully simple as 'big' words and 'little' words would be even more meaningful.

    So, I should look up the two words that have used (only because I have heard them used in this way before) to see where I went wrong; and, if possible, I should find suitable "linguistically neutral" terms to describe these two categories, then give my definitions of these new terms.


>>In Glosa a word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.

>*   So FU is 'the future' or 'in the future' or 'will be [adjective]'. >ITERA is 'to repeat' or 'repitition' or 'repeating'. No Problem here.

>

&   The problem arises when Clark and Ashby repeat the Hogben original, that the language is a concept-language, like Chinese, and that each word is thus a concept centre.  People take violent exception to Chinese being described as a 'concept language'.  However, I am glad that you take no exception to this word-representing-a-concept idea.

>

&   I have not heard the term "right branching" before, but can guess what it means.  Originally I had though that "Head Final" structure covered the situation, well enough; but then, Mike Farris told me, briefly, what that term meant, and it did not fit either.

    So, we might have to rewrite the grammar book, and come up with all of our own terms to describe Glosa, simply because it does not fit the existing definitions, even though it is (more or less) fully consistent within itself.

    On schools and girls, I imagine that Glosa learners will be taught, at the start, to break up the phrase into two, using prepositions:-

   ~u beli pusi sko-do pro plu ju-fe~  OR

   ~u sko-do de u beli pusi ju-fe~


>>Within a phrase, the semantically least significant words come first,

>>and the phrase builds with modifiers in the middle, and the substantive

>>word (Head) last.

>*   So what happens when the Phrase Head is a compound word,

>as in 'old wise washer-woman' where the fact that the person is

>a 'washer' by trade is just as important as that she's a woman, but

>that she's wise is less important (less essential, less necessary, more

>contingent)? Do you use concatenated words, like Esp 'olda sagxa

>lavovirino'?

>

&   At present the compound is either hyphenated or left as two words: I prefer the use of the hyphen, especially where, as in this example, the two parts of the compound have almost the same semantic weighting.  Though, in a more humanitarian, and less functional way, I believe the 'feminine' element to have the greater value.   By using the hyphen, then, the compound is readily recognised as the 'Head' of the phrase.  From your Esperanto, I judge that only the *lavovirino* contains concatenisation.  And the answer is NO: the words, in Glosa, are supposed to maintain their identity (even for computer recognition, and I guess we can teach the computer the significance of a hyphen); also, the -ino type of "diminutive" does not feature in Glosa, apart from the direct negative where ~no-getili~

is "unkind", but ~andra~ is "man", and ~gina~ is "woman.

    BTW, ~sagaci paleo lava-fe~ covers "wise old washer-woman" in Glosa.


>>6. There are three basic verb types in Glosa:-

>*   Aha! Good! A usable description of language structure,  much more

>useful than 'don't talk about it - use it!'

>

>>   Substantives: full verbs in their own right e.g.  KI [go]

>>   Verboids: semi-verbs, precede main verb, usually have no

>>       infinitive e.g. POTE [can]

>*   These are Auxiliary Verbs.

>>   Auxiliaries: form phrasal verbs, follow main verb  e.g. ANA [up]

>*   Phrasal Verbs have the form Verb-Particle-(Preposition), such as

>Take off, Wear Out, Put up with. (There's a few oddbods like Take a

>look, Throw in).

>   What you're call Auxiliaries I understand as Particles.

>

&   You are right.  It is my belief that Hogben was intuitively discovering "Functional Grammar" before Halliday came on the scene.  As such, he tried to name the functions of the words, and used terms which have been replace with others, as the science of linguistics matured.

    I looked into the Cobuild English Grammar, and found:-

  be, have, do as "auxiliaries"  AND

  can, could, may, might, must, ought, shall should, will as "modal verbs" or "modal auxiliaries"


    So, yes the Interglossa/Glosa terminology is archaic, and we ought to decide on wheter to go with the current usage within Functional Grammar, or to hoe our own row, and use "verboids" but define them specifically.

    On the auxiliaries, ES, HABE, and AKTI are used in Glosa much as the English-language equivalents are used, and so warrant the modern terminology, 'auxiliaries'.

    And, while the generic word, 'particles' does cover the small words following 'verbs' in Glosa, as well as in English, I would like to find a distinctive term for these particular particle, to separate them from Glosa's other particles, because these have a more syntactic significance, while the verb particles are more semantic in function.

   Guess I should expand the list to four types of verbs with:

"Substantives" (or a more suitable modern term) e.g. RIDI [laugh],

 Auxiliaries    e.g. HABE [have]

 Modals (or Verboids)   e.g. POTE [can]

 Phrasals       e.g. KI ANA [go up]


   But we definitely do not want to scare people off Glosa by 'over grammaticising' it.

   While "Predicate" is the description you would use for verbs that can stand alone, is there another possible descriptive term that you can think of, for the words that function as 'full verbs' .. while noting that in other sentences, the exact same words could function as nouns or modifiers.

    Still, adding it all up, Hogben went too far into the intricacies of Grammar in "Interlingua", but Clark and Ashby over-reacted by going too far in the opposite direction, trying to avoid giving anygrammar guidelines, which might have been potentially confusing.  Although I feel Hogben's error was the greater, I now wish to find the ^golden mean^ by giving just enough grammatical information to allow learners to use Glosa wisely, while not confusing them.  I would

>>     e.g.   An         pote     ki    ana         u monta.

>>glos.       he         can      go     up         the mountain

>>                    [He can ascend the mountain.]

>*   _IF_ it can be garrunteed that Glosa will _only_ have Phrasal

>Verbs that can be literally unpacked - so that one may GO UP,

>CLIMB DOWN, WALK OUT, but not THINK UP,

>DUMB DOWN, or WEAR OUT - then the charge that Glosa

>is relaxified English can be rebuffed.

>

>>>   The 'verboid' list suggests to me that Ashby

>>>and Clarke realised at some late point that a part-of-speech-less

>>>language was not possible.

>>*   Super-sleuthing finds "Auxiliaries" on p108 of _Interglossa_, and

>>"Verboids" on p171.  So auxiliaries and verboids are a hang-over from

>>Hogben, not a last-minute patch-up by Clark and Ashby.

>*  Fair enough. I stand corrected.

&   Possibly, the Glosa authors should retink these Interglossa terms.


>>    And, of course, I expect no retraction of the statement "a part-of-

*Haitao in China was the best case of this, but he is an Esperantist, and
did not like Glosa's lack of P-o-S markers and verb inflections.
    So, I am left with intuition as my next best indicator of Universal

    It is safe to go ISO, and part of Bill's way of doing things.  However,
if we allow a range of usages for such things, then, as long as the methods
are self-consistent and unambiguous, then they will make sense, and be
understood.
    I am a bit of an open-planner, and would think that in Glosa we should
avoid the conformism that feels like cultism .. in favour of an
ecumenachism that states we have thought of the problems, and suggest a
range of possible method which are acceptible  - mainly because they allow
unequivocal communication.  If I use a date format of either 27.02.1999 or

    I have sent my suggestions of the tense and aspect particles in Glosa to the list.  Now its your turn: maybe you have already done so, and I have not caught up with it yet.

    As Paul says, there's tense, aspect, mood and passivity too.

    Perhaps, Paul, if you make a list, using the English language, of the categories of particles, itemising same, that would be in your ideal language, then we will all know what we could be aiming at.


    While algebraically, it would be nice to keep each category of

pre-verb function separate, I imagine that the human mind might not be so neat.  This accounts for contractions, that are combinations of elements from the different categories, popularly used in English.  They might not be neat, but they are warm and cosy, and strangely human:-

  don't  [do not]

  has  [have is]

  had  [have did]

  can't  [can not]

  wasn't  [not did be]

  hadn't  [did not have]  ... are there places where "hadn't" is right,

                and "did not have" is wrong?

               EG  "If I hadn't done it, I'd be dead by now."

  was  [were is]

  seeded  [did seed]

  walking  [walk go] {? continuous}


    I suspect that a Glosa with fully separated particles will look and sound stilted, even though it may be computationally perfect.


    Then there is the odd question about finding suitable separate particles that fit in with Glosa's derivational system: do the sought for particles exist as separate elements in the Classical languages, or can we derive suitable particles from other languages, as I understand Glosa's GE- affix to have been, coming from German?

    I have stated my opinion that all the Glosa verb system really
needs at present is a perfective marker and some uniform way of forming
a passive.  With respect to the latter, I object so much to bringing
'get/got' into the discussion for the simple reason that "get" and
"got" are not even used the same way throughout the English speaking
world!  Robin, speaking Brito-Oz English, uses them differently from
the way we Yankees use them -- or don't use them, frequently.  So using
'get/got' to describe a verb construction just muddies up the water
because of inconsistent usage even among native anglophones.  As for a
perfective marker, I have not yet seen a good candidate and have not
come up with one of my own.

>     As Paul says, there's tense, aspect, mood and passivity too.

    I presume that "passivity" refers to voice, and for the record,
active and passive are not the only voices known.  Classical Greek had
a middle voice.

    By "using the English language" do you mean "providing examples
from English verb forms?  If that in fact is what you mean, I will not
do so, precisely because the English verb system is such a mess that
trying to draw examples from it will shed more obscurity that light.
Really, verbal modalities are so basic that they should not even need
examples for conIAL constructors.  However, my short list is
approximately like so:

Tense: past, present, future; the present could possibly be the
       unmarked form, although this is negotiable in ambiguous cases.

Aspect: imperfective, perfective; the ummarked form is simply unmarked
        for aspect.

Mood: this remains not entirely well worked out, although some
      languages (such as English) often mark mood primarily with
      auxiliaries; the existing Glosa auxiliaries appear to be
      adequate; however, do imperative/jussive and/or optative
      need to be set out better?

Voice: active for the unmarked form; passive needs to be regularized:
      I favor the 'es ge-X' form of G.E.O.; I do NOT like the 'gene
      ge-X' form, considering it rather ugly, redundant, and an
      unnecessary aping of some -- not all! -- dialects of English;
      medial/reflexive voice can be taken care of by pronominal
      constructions, although the appropriate uses of 'se' and 'auto'
      are ambiguous and not well defined.

    Rubbish.  Any particular set of contractions tends to depend on the
particular characteristics of the language in which they occur.  They
seem "warm and cosy, and strangely human" -only- to native speakers.
To non-native speakers, they may simply be baffling.  I never have
figured out the rationale for some French contractions.  They probably
have none, just as English contractions have no rationale other than a
tendency within English phonemics to reduce vowels.  English, as a
structurally Germanic language, does not shy away from consonant
clusters clusters and vowel reductions.  There is nothing particularly
"warm and cosy" about them at all.  I think you are once again being
led astray by your native language habits.

    No, because Greek and Latin were/are highly inflected languages, so
there were numerous inflected forms doing the work of particles in an
highly isolating language like Glosa.

    I thought that 'ge-' was contracted from 'gene', itself of Greek
origin.

    I am not saying that blending tense and aspect in one construction
is somehow -wrong-.  After all, the horrendous English verb system does
work after a fashion.  I am only saying two things: 1) In a planned
auxiliary language, I see no good reason for not keeping tense and
aspect separate, as is so in some languages and would be easier to
teach (at least to non-Anglophones; many native anglophones are already
warped by their native habits); 2) I see no valid justification for
having a sole particle blending just one specific pair of tense and
aspect in place of a welter of particles combining every conceivable
combination of tense, aspect, mood, and voice.  Why not just have
several dozen such particles and be done with it?

    I am not convinced one way or the other whether there even is such
a thing as "Universal Grammar."  But that is irrelevant.  Tense,
aspect, mood, and voice are simply empirically validated analytical
descriptors of the way verbs work.

    I am not aware that there is any better analysis of the way verbs
work.  What is the opposition to analytical categories which apply
across languages generally?  What makes Glosa so special and sui
generis?

    What does this even mean?  Languages are all over the map in
"parsimony and elegance," due to both linguistic characteristics and
social factors.  I have no reason to think that some sort of "mental
mechanism" is at work here.  Again and again, we -must- not be misled
into thinking that the comfortable habits of our native language
constitute some sort of mystical "language universals."

    I have addressed this in another post.  The issue is Glosa's verb
system, not English's.

    I tender my opinion that in such matters, intuition is an

acculturations, and experiences may have vastly different "intuitions"
about the same things.

    I do not know how much of a laughing stock Glosa would be if it
continued with the present system that lumps tense, aspect and mood
together ... and calls them particles.  It would be a lot easier for 99% of
the human population, as well.

*   The main thin is that the vast majority of people who know anything

are.
    Calling it a "Verb Particle Table" would be honest, but a mouthful, and
somewhat confusing to the vast majority.

    I really can understand why Ron Clark wanted to leave the formalities
of grammar out of the story.  But I am sorry to say he vastly
underestimated the ability of people to jump into Glosa, and start using it
.. in such a way that the pattern would emerge with use.
    Another snippet of Glosa history: the way I learnt how to use Glosa was
by using it.  There was no Grammar Book then: there is none now.
Where, one wonders, is the courage that once made warriors into heros?
    There ent much of it about in the halls of Interlinguistics, anyway.

With Apologies,

    What I am not sure about is whether the Formal Grammar-type terminology
that you are using is similarly ^hung up^ on Engish. 

    I do suspect that Glosa grammar far from being a cleaned up carbon copy
of English Grammar could be something quite different, and a medium of pure
communication .. or communication as pure as something as imperfect as the
human brain, can get it. 
 
    Although you havn't said it, I am suspecting that you have something
against the use of "has" and "had" as particles in English, possibly 
because they appear to mix the verbs "to have" and "to do". 

    has begun  - did start and is still going on; did continue to begin

    had begun  - did start, but is not going now; did cease to begin
               - did start, but is no longer starting now

 ???  Apart from the confusions of English that you dislike, and which
English-speakers use without knowing about all the rules they are breaking,
why not accompany you questions with ^trial sentences^ in Glosa???  

    Maybe I am asking the group to make positive comments about the way
meaning is, or can be, conveyed in Glosa.

    Say a person asks, how do you say this in Glosa, and a number of
Glosalistas put forward suggestions, then we will have something to work 
on.  I would ask people to try Glosa, even if they start with phrases.  If
you put the mental effort in, you will be able to grade up to sentences,
and one day, whole stories.

  is an English idiom relixified into Glosa; I thought it was an Adverbial
Phrase.  Still, I had thought that in any language, the logicality of ''and
so it follows'' [=that] was a necessity for clear thinking and logical
exposition.
    But trying hard, I wondered about the suitability of alternative Glosa

  ta forti ??? id frakto

    With commas, in English, it can be confusing if a series of them is
used in a sentence, with each comma having a different function; in Glosa,
where there are less textual clues, the "; = ,+" idea seems a worthwhile
innovation, to mark the introduction of a new clause.

*   As far as I have experienced it the number of true auxiliaries is less
than ten, ES, HABE, AKTI, GENE; and the verboids, which are usually used as
'helper 'verbs' is around twenty, POSI, POTE, NECE, DEBI, VOLU, 
SEQE, .... .   But, Glosa is not supposed to be classified to the ultimate
degree: this would be tantamount to rigidifying the language to the point
where the life(vitality) was squeezed out of it.  Some of the words which
can function as verboids are also able to function as verbs in their own
right, others not.  Many substantives, under the right circumstances, can
function as verboids.
    I would say that the essence of a word - the idea embued in it - is
part of SEMANTIC GRAMMAR, and not part of the syntactic analysis of the
language.  
    Here, in trying to force meaning into morphological structures, we are
erring in a way analogous to trying to force tense and aspect into 
PRA.  There probably should be lee-way in both areas; but trying to shape a
word because of its usual function seems, to me, to be getting away from
the original Glosa ethos.  If it works psychologically, as well as for the
computer, well and good; but, if an imposed CVCV structure feels
artificial, I believe it is wrong.

to be shorter than most substantives.  The words that glue together the
substance of what we want to say, are dealt with briefly, while the words
that have full semantic strength (substantial meaning) are the ones we
emphasise.
    But I am still of the impression that Glosa is supposed to be
naturalistic, with the feel of a normal human language.  Hence, I believe
that rigid rules will give the language a stilted feel.

    This is far, far better than trying to subsume all the connectives
under one, such as some counterpart to the egregiously overloaded
English "that."

    (By the way, it is looking more and more like my participation on
Glosalist may soon be coming to an end due to the time constraints of
upcoming employment.)

Robin,
	Saluta!
	I have given the matter of ";" vs "ke" some thought, and am going 
to stop doing so.  It is becoming very confusing!  PROVIDED THAT ";" has 
the meaning of introducing a clause AND is a definite stop, like a period 
(full stop), I think it can be retained.  I have to admit that I cannot 
come down heavily on either side.  A comma would merely add to the mess 
again.

I think you need the comma and/or some (any) conjunction;
KE is too valuable as a relativizer to use in that spot, IMO.

*   Since trying to get Glosa standardised, I have found, increasingly,
that, by contrast with what we are trying to do in Glosa, the general
standard of usage of English is quite 'sloppy'.
    This, and Paul's comments are what makes me wonder if we should not
come up with our own, appropriate terms to cover what happens in Glosa.
    And this, of course, begs the question: what really does happen in Glosa!?

    Thus, by circular argument, we come back to the starting point of
learning how to use Glosa, by using it.

    So, we come back to the question about the most suitable way to
describe Glosa's grammar, and the attempt to set this out in readable form.

    I will try soon, to catch up with an editing of my earlier SBG
(Syntax-based Grammar) posting, with ammendments as suggested by people on
this list.

    For those of us who are not up with the latest, can you please give
more details of how the newer, simple automated translation systems work.
    Such information would be helpful with the selection of lexemes for a
Machine-handlable subset of Glosa - or even for refining the full language.

    But I would like to understand more of the HOW, so that I can
understand the shape of the language that facilitates such a system.
    For example, had the DLT (Distributed Language Translation) project,
based on Esperanto, got closer to the nuts and bolts of the mechanics of
the process, I suspect that a more congruent Intermediate Language would
have been derived from Esperanto, and that the project would have been
flourishing to-day.  While, of course, I believe now, as I did then, that
the thing would have worked beautifully had the starting point been Glosa,
not Esperanto.

*   The DLT with Esperanto, is the closest anyone has come to trying Glosa
with a parser.  I have tried, in the past, to generate interest in the both
ideas: developing parsers for Glosa; and of seeing Glosa as a potential
"Middle Language" or 'meaning representation system', for translation.
But, what you are suggesting as a possibility is the closest we have come
to realisation of either of these ideas.

    But such thoughts smack of altruism, and generally lack a profit
motive.  I suspect that it will only be through 'not-for-profit' groupings
like Auxlang and Glosalist, that such broadly beneficial, though
non-exploitable, usages of computers will come.  
    So, go for it.  There could even be a ^buck in it^ for you, if you
retain copyright, and Glosa does become generalised.

     I found "jussive" and "optative" in the Glossary in the back of my
_Encyclopedia of Syntactic Theories_ but it hasn't done me much good.
     I suspect that we never did go out of our way to create special forms

they should be in Glosa.  My understanding is that the 'simplicity' idea
acts against the introduction of special particles or auxiliaries for such

I would use "fini", or maybe "fin".
Auxiliaries almost always start out as regular verbs,
then get "semantically bleached" into particles.
The perfective really means the action is finished,
whether as of now or as of a past time.

"Fe PA gene u feli" ... She was getting (and possibly did get) a cat.
"Fe PA DU gene u feli" ... She was getting (in the act of) a cat.
"Fe PA FIN gene u feli" ... She did get (completely) a cat.
"Fe PA PRE-FIN gene u feli" ... She had already gotten a cat.

Or something like that. I don't like "NO-DURA" much,
but that looks like the status quo for completive aspect.
Lots of tricky "modals" are already in there already ...

    Best suggestion I have heard yet on the matter, although G.E.O.
materials seem to put a teleological twist on "fini" as having the 
meaning "end, aim."

    As I mentioned before, 'parato' seems a bit long for the usage.

    Conditional is a mood, not an aspect.

    I am not recommmending that anything be added as long as what needs
to be expressed can be expressed with what is available.

    I concur.

    We can say it, all right, but we seem not to -use- it the way you
Australians (and probably some Brits) use it.  I think it was George
Bernard Shaw (or somebody) who described Britain and the United States
as two countries separated by the same language.  Usage is not uniform
even among native speakers of a language as widely diffused as English. 
Pity the poor Canadians, drawn betwixt and between the U.S. and
Britain!

    I have to admit that these examples still have not clarified for me
the difference between 'se' and 'auto'.

*   So, Please find a language in which "tense, aspect, mood, and voice"
are separate, and jot down, in *Whatever*, the various instances, of the
above characteristics, that you imagine relevant to an IAL.
    And for those of us who are 'monoglot', with English as our only
natlang, would you please give English-language renditions of the gist of
the meanings of the *Whatever* instances.

    Then, those of us who are keen to see the Net Glosa idea ^wrapped up^,
will have something to work on - so we can reach a conclusion on this
"particles-before-the-verb" situation.

    I imagine that we need to agree on the range of instances per
characteristic, and then on the suitability of lexemes for the various
positions, before we can be happy with making genuine additions to the
language.  Selling such ideas to the authors may be another matter.

    Before I am happy with something I write in Glosa, it has to pass the
"tongue test": when I say it, it feels comfortable; and correspondingly,
when I hear what I have said, it sounds good.
    I believe that any such proposed ammendments to Glosa would need to
pass the "tongue test" also, before we suggest them to Glosa Central.

    It may look funny,and even ugly, but does help define the syntax in a
language in which the syntax defines the grammar.

    My natural feeling is that a Noun Clause is an 'object', and, as such
warrants a colon.  However, if this is not a common belief, I feel that the
semicolon is a worthwhile compromise, and I prefer to stick with it.

    The resurrection of, the Old Glosa, ~ke~, on the other hand is another
matter.  English speakers are used to having such a function-word at the
start of Noun Clauses and Adverbial Clauses, and if possible, I feel it
should be retained.

    On looking in the Latin dictionary, I find:-

     <italic>finio  </italic>to limit, bound, enclose

     <italic>finitus  </italic>limited, restricted, rhythmical

     <italic>finis  </italic>boundary, limit, border  {Q. Did the Latin
appear in italic?} 


    So, if ~fini~ = end, finish

           ~fin~  can be the perfective particle 


    I use ~buta~ [butt,aim,purpose] to mean "end" (objective).


Saluta,

 Robin G.

   P.S.  The ~parato~ [already] I suggested as a possible 'perfective',
is quite a good, legitimate word in its own right, and probably should be
in the lexicon.  At present, it is Old Glosa, and has possibly been
?superceded? by another word.

    You like the clean lines of a sentence that runs on .. without the
interruption of (unnecessary) punctuation; I am thinking of the worst case
scenario, where an absence of punctuation makes life difficult for the reader.
    So, as far as I am concerned, people should have the freedom to operate
their language within reasonable limits: from 'verbose' to 'maximum
elision'.  If this situation applied, then we would be both right: me using
the unnecessary verbose form; and, you using elision.

    If, when expressing myself in English, I did hit something so hard that

always

    used with other verbs.  They are a special kind of <bold>auxiliary

    verb.

</bold>

    Here is a list of the modals used in English:

     ____________________________________________________

    |                                                    |

    |____________________________________________________| " 


   So, these, I have previously called "verboids".  Maybe I should get
into line with Functional Grammar, and describe them as "modals".


   In Glosa the list looks like:-

    pote  [can]    nece  [must]      sio  [would]

    posi  [may]    debi  [ought to] 


    sio debi  [should]

Commas are OK with me, but I definitely want the "KE".
Even in English, a "which/that" to start a clause is welcome.
Those semicolons of Glosa will turn into commas, I predict,
in actual common use; so I'll cease complaining about them.

>> >> 4. so hard that it broke -   ta forti KE id frakto  .... AdvC     

The word "hardness" applies more to objects than actions,
so I still object to using "hard" instead of "forceful",
especially in the same phrase with "broke". It's poor idiom.

> a.   It was so hot that it burnt him.

"KA id habe ta termo, SO id kausti an."

I just noticed KA in the vocab.  At least it isn't exactly KE.
I don't know which is better, or when to use one or the other.
I would use SO in all the examples ...

It isn't enough. In free speech, people often pause and re-state.
We need to use the "KE" and other conjunctions to be explicit.
Adding some pauses and commas doesn't hurt though.

*   Although ~ka~ is an abbreviation of ~kausa~, I find that they do seem

  An akti so, ka an volu akti so.  [He acts thus, because he wants to.]

 An akti so; te kausa u resulta. [He acts so, (in order)to cause a result.]

 An pa pugna pro u kausa.   [He fought for the cause.]

 Ka id, an pa tardi arive.   [Because of it, he arrived late.]

*   Agreed, speech is ragged around the edges, but I was concentrating,
here, on day to day communication, and it is still my considered opinion
that, at the abstract level,  'punctuation' = 'vocal effects'.

It isn't ANY tense. The authors seem to have imported
the English *idea* that "unmarked" tense == "present",
yet we do not even use English that way. Our "present"
can be timeless or habitual or past or future. To me,
unless the NU particle is used, it isn't present tense.

"Pa-di, id kausti an" ... surely this is more acceptable
than "Pa-di, id pa kausti an". And without the "pa-di",
context would most likely indicate the time of the event.

*   Well, if a language uses NO marking of Tense as a 'default' to the
Present, I see no harm in it ... and just because the English (or more
likely the Americans) make a mess of it, there is no reason that we, in
Glosa, should do the same.
  "I goes into this bar: I see this beautiful brunette. I order her a
beer." - pure Mickey Spillane, nothing to do with the Brits or us in Oz.

   When Paul Bartlett was with us, he was always chiding me for my
"punctillious" use of Tense Particles.
   If it was Past, I used ~pa~ before every 'verb'.  And Not a bad rule
either!

 I?E?  I went home, get some food and eat it.          (~=2)

  -->1.  Mi pa ki a domi; pa gene sito, e pa fago id.
OR
  -->2.  Mi pa ki a domi; gene sito, e fago id.

AND ??
        I went home, got some food, and ate it.         (~=1)

 N.B. The English-language version of  2.  sounds funny, but that was what
Paul demanded, in the Glosa!!!

 I*E*  Mi nu ki a domi; nu greso peri, id e nu fosi intra u jardina.(->3)

       Mi ki a domi; greso peri id, e fosi intra u jardina.        (->4)

       Now I go home, walk around it, and dig in the garden.    (~=3)
       
       I go home, walk around it, and dig in the garden.       (~=4)


I believe that Glosa versions  ->2 & ->4  pass the "tongue/ear test".

 Glosa  ->1  does sound a bit heavy, but it is consistent.

 Glosa  ->3  is too heavy, altogether.

Please ponder on it: I'd like to hear Glosalista's opinions on this, thanks. 

>"Pa-di, id kausti an" ... surely this is more acceptable
>than "Pa-di, id pa kausti an". And without the "pa-di",
>context would most likely indicate the time of the event.
>
*   Yes, I now see the sense (and psycholinguistics) of 

       Pa-di, id kausti an  
BUT
   It still translates directly to      Yesterday, it burn him

   So we have no alternative but to say that Glosa and English form tenses,
in a sentence, DIFFERENTLY.

>> *   ~qi~ is supposed to be the "relativizer".
>
>Oops, I mixed them up. KA and SO too, probably.
>
*   No, they are OK:-

    Ka id habe ta termo; so id kausti an.
   (because it has so_much heat thus it burns him)
    Because it's so hot, it burnt him.
OR  It's so hot that it burnt him.

[Good day to all Glosalistas,

Glosa Exercises %2: Translation from English into Glosa

This is another simple introduction to actual use of the language, Glosa.

0. The woman went to the shop to buy a book. __ U gina pa ki ad u boteka,
     te merca u bibli.__

1. Your father arrived home late from work. __________________________
2. Is the weather hot?  ______________________________________________

4. To-night, we will go to an interesting shop. ______________________
5. She happily reads the book he gave her.  __________________________

 -------------------------------------------------------------------
  I again include key words, below.
You can download the Glosa Classified (1000) from my website, and I can
send you a wordlist by email, but the best bet is to ask for a free copy of
the "Experimental dictionaries" (Glosa 6000. Eng->Glosa & Glosa->Eng -
IBM:ASCII format).

PLU 'noun marker(plural)',  SITO food,  TARDI late,slow,  TE in_order_to,
TERMO hot,  TU you,your(singular),  U 'noun marker',  U-CI this.

P.S. I am very sorry for rushing the vocab in Ex.%1, because I got "food"
and "eating" mixed: sito = food, fago = eating,to_eat.  I have corrected
this in the Ex.%2 associated vocab, above.

   If you have not had the chance to try Glosa for yourself up to now,
please start here.

PPS. I am aware that a general Glosa instruction book will move slower than
these exercises - increasing in complexity more gradually.  However, I am
hoping that, for subscribers to this List, such a pace would be too slow;
if this is not the case, and I am asking you to progress with the language
faster than is reasonable, please let me know.   R.G.

1. Overview
  #1 Derivation of Language Characteristics
    . Vocabulary is from the Classical roots of Greek & Latin
    . Pronunciation - Five Vowels of Italian & Spanish
    . Sentence structure - Similar to English
    . Words are Concept Centres - Based on Chinese
  #2 Words Don't Change With Use
    . Words do not have Gender.
    . Words do not Agree in Number.
    . The same word, unchanged, can function as noun, verb, or modifier.
    . 'Verbs' have no inflections.
    . 'Nouns' do not change to form the plural.
  #3 No Part-of-Speech Markers
    . A word is not changed to form a different part of speech.
    . A word's functioning as a particular Part-of-Speech is indicated by 
      its position in the sentence.
  #4 Precedence Rule Creates Syntax
    . One word modifies the next, and so on.
    . Phrase starts with least significant word, ends in most significant.
    . There is an order for placing words (least to most sig.) in a phrase. 
    . Precedence combines with Subject-Verb-Object order and clause
      structure to produce syntax.

2. Basic Structure
  A. Words
    i. These are symbols for ideas, and are the atoms of language, but are
       of little meaning, singly.
   ii. There are two major groups of words:-
      a)Primitives: comprising a small number of basic function words -
        present in all languages - these allow us to describe the
        relationships between the major concepts we convey, EG de [of], 
        e [and], pre [before], qe [-> ?], supra [above].   
      b)Substantives: the ever-expanding list of words representing things,
        actions and descriptions (sometimes usable for all three), EG 
        kurso [run], vide [see], via [road], oku [eye], hedo [happy], 
        celera [swift].
  iii. Consonant vowel (CV, CVCV, etc) structure for ease of pronunciation:
       this pattern is the general trend, not a rigidly imposed rule.
   iv. Formation of new words could be by adding completely new words, but 
       is usually through compounding, with hyphens, of unchanged existing
       words.
  B. Phrases
    i. A phrase is the smallest unit of Glosa to have recognisable meaning.
   ii. There are four main phrases, depending on their function within
        the sentence:-
      a)Noun Phrase: small group with a 'noun' preceded by descriptive words. 
      b)Verb Phrase: small group with a 'verb' preceded by its modifiers.
      c)Prepositional Phrase: preposition plus a Noun Phrase; can be an
        "Indirect Object" to the 'verb'. 
      d)Adverbial Phrase: small group with a modifier, amplifying the 
        meaning of the 'verb'; can be one word at the start or end of   the
        sentence. 
  iii. Phrases in a simple sentence follow the Subject+Verb(+Object) 
        pattern, with:-
      a)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase ... with Intransitive 'verb'.
      b)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Noun Phrase ... Transitive 'verb'.
      c)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Prepositional Phrase .. 'verb' has Indirect
        Object.
   iv. Glosa phrases are "Substantive Final", starting with the least 
       important word, and followed by additional words combining progress-
       ively to extend the meaning of the substantive, which comes last.
  C. Clauses
     i. A Glosa sentence with only one 'verb' is a Major Clause.
    ii. With two, or more 'verbs' in a sentence, there is one Major clause,
        with the other 'verb(s)' usually in Minor Clauses that add meaning 
        to the Major Clause.
   iii. Two, or more, Major Clauses may be combined in a sentence through
        the use of one, or more, conjunctions.
    iv. Where ambiguity is otherwise possible, a semi-colon is used as a
        Start-of-Clause Marker.
     v. There are three types of Minor Clause in Glosa:-
       a)Noun Clause: larger group that takes the place of a Noun Phrase.  
       b)Adjectival Clause: larger group usually starting with the Relative 
         Pronoun, ~qi~, and following the 'noun' it adds meaning to.
       c)Adverbial Clause: larger group, that could be anywhere in the
         sentence, but which extends the meaning of the main verb of the
         sentence.  These start with a word that places or explains  the
         action of the 'verb' they qualify, examples: time ~kron~ [when],
         location ~loka~ [where], spacial ~dia~ [through],
         logical ~anti-co~ [however], causal ~te~ [in order to].
  D. Sentence
     The minimum meaningful group within Glosa: it starts with a capital 
     letter and ends with a full stop or equivalent.           

3. Function Words 
  E. Noun Markers
    i. Indicating the start of a Noun Phrase, particles are placed in front 
       of numerators and other modifiers that come before the 'noun'.
   ii. The particle indicates whether the 'noun' is Singular or Plural:
      a)~u~ is the particle for singular 'nouns', and
      b)~plu~ is the particle for plural 'nouns'. 
  F. Prepositions
    i. Small words that give information about a following Noun Phrase or
       Adverbial Clause:
      a)Time: tem [at the time], po [after], pre [before], kron [when].
      b)Place: lo [where], to [at], ab [away].  
      c)Relationship: epi [on], in [into], intra [inside], a [towards],
       infra [under], supra [over], inter [between], ex[out of],
       tele [far], proxi [near].  
   ii. Small words that introduce an Advebial Clause: 
       so [thus], ka [because], sine [instead of], te [in order to]
  G. Modifiers
     Words placed before a substantive to amplify its meaning; they are 
     usually substantives too, but they add meaning to the final word in 
     the phrase.
    i. Without changing, the same word can modify a 'noun'(being called an
       adjective) or a 'verb'(and be called an adverb).
   ii. In Noun Phrases, there are also modifiers of Number, Quantity & 
       Quality, that are paced after the Noun Marker but before the 'noun'.   
  H. Other Functions
    i. Conjunctions
       These join equivalent units within the sentence: words, phrases or 
       clauses:-
      a)Combination: e [and]
      b)Opposition: sed [but]
      c)Alternative: alo [or]  
      d)Binary Alternative: alo X alo Y [either X or Y]
   ii. Negatives
       Placed before the substantive these negate its meaning:
      a)Nouns: nuli [no,nothing] 
      b)Verbs: ne [do not .. ], no- [un-...]
      c)Binary Negatives: ni P ni Q [neither P nor Q]
  iii. Questions
      a)The placing of ~qe~ before a statement makes it a question.
      b)~qo?~ [what?] 
      c)~qo-~ is used to form compound question words: qo-lo [where],
       qo-tem [when], qo-te [why,what intention], qo-mode [how], qo-pe [who]
   iv. Generic Terms
       Two-letter abbreviations of substantives can be added, using hyphens, 
       as terminal affixes, to change the category of a word: there are about
       twenty of these. 
        EG post [mail], persona [person], posta-pe [postman]
    v. Reflexive Forms
       The action of the 'verb' is received by the Subject of the clause. 
      a)Where the Subject is a person, ~auto~ is placed after the 'verb',
         EG An bate auto. [He hit himself.]
      b)For impersonal Subjects, ~se~, or ~-se~ is put after the 'verb'.
    
         EG U makina pa frakto-se. [The machine broke itself.]
4. Substantives
  I. Concept Words
     In Glosa each concept is conveyed by one word, and it can function,
     unchanged, as a noun, verb or modifier, depending on its position in
     the sentence.  These make up the majority of the lexicon, and all new 
     word for objects, action or descriptions, are substantives.

Hello Again,
  Here's the second half of the Ver.2 Glosa Grammar.   R.G.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Noun Phrases
  J. Substantive as 'noun'
     A simple sentence has two Noun Phrases, one for Subject the other for
     Object.  The final word in a NP is a substantive acting as a noun.
   i. A single 'noun' can constitute a Noun Phrase.
  ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of determinants and modifiers,
      as well as the final substantive 'noun' in a Noun Phrase. 
  K. Pronouns    
     These take the place of substantives, and represent them, acting in 
     every way like the full 'noun'.
   i. Personal Pronouns represent people:
     a)First person: mi [I], na [we]
     b)Second Person: tu [you(singular)], vi [you(plural)]
     c)Third Person: an [he], fe [she], pe [a person], mu [them]
  ii. Impersonal Pronouns: u-ci [this], u-la [that]
 iii. Relative Pronoun (Adjectival Clause Marker): qi [which,that]
  L. Determinants and Numerators
     These are particles that tell about the quantitative nature of the 
     'noun', and are placed at the start of the Noun Phrase. 
   i. Noun Markers: u [=a,the], plu [=the](indicates plurality); these 
      can be omitted, if context, or other words in the NP, clearly 
      indicate the presence of the 'noun'
  ii. Countables
      Countables exist in discrete numbers, and may be described using:
     a)Numbers: mo [one], bi [two], deka [ten], bi-tri [twenty-three].
     b)General terms: oligo [few], poly [many], mega, [big], pusi [small].
      plura [several], 
 iii. Quantifiers 
      Substances that are Measured, not Counted, are described using:
      u mero de [a piece of], ma [more], meio [less], maxi [most],
      u qantita de [an amount of]. 
  M. Noun Modifiers
     Substantives functioning as nouns may be modifies qualitatively by 
     other substantives placed directly before them.
    i. Adjectives: This is the traditional term for Noun Modifiers.
   ii. Compounding: When two, or more, substantives combine, often 
       hyphenated, to form one complex concept, they modify the meaning of
       one another.
        EG trans-natio-korporati [TNC]

6. Verb Phrases
     A simple sentence has one Verb Phrase in the middle of the sentence:
     the final word in a V.P. is a substantive acting as a verb.
   i. A single 'verb' can constitute a Verb Phrase.
  ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of particles and modifiers,
      as well as the final substantive 'verb', in a Verb Phrase. 
  N. Substantive as 'verb'
     In a V.P. one substantive functions as the verb.
    i. The 'verb' represents the action associated with the substantive.
   ii. The substantive is not modified to show that it acts as a verb.
  iii. 'verbs' in Glosa are not inflected.
   iv. The substantive 'verb' is the final word in the V.P. being 
       preceded in the phrase by particles and modifiers.
  O. Auxiliary Verbs
     These substantive - capable of acting as verbs on their own - precede
     the main 'verb' and augment its meaning.  These are: es [being,is],
     habe [has_the_quality_of,"is"], gene [gets,becomes,"is"].
  P. Modal Verbs
     These are lesser 'verbs' that usually precede the main 'verb'
     modifying how it acts.  These are: posi [possibly], pote [can],
     debi [ought to], nece [must], probabili [probably]. 
  Q. Phrasal Verbs
     A Phrasal Verb comprises a substantive 'verb' followed by one (or
     more) "post-positions" that extend the meaning of the 'verb'.
      EG,  ki ana  [go up], moti ab  [move away from], loka antero [put
         in front of]
  R. Verb Modifiers
     The 'verb'is the final word in the V.P., and any word before the 
     substantive 'verb' modifies that 'verb'. The modifiers in a V.P. 
     follow a sequence of increasing importance to the meaning of the 
     phrase:- 
        Tense - Aspect - Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive   
    i. Tense Particles
       Strictly speaking there are two Tense particles:-
        pa - Past Tense
        -    Present Tense
        fu - Future Tense
        The default for a 'verb' not marked for tense is Present Tense. 
   ii. Aspect Particles
       A number of other words relating to the timing or intention of the
       action can come after the Tense particle to extend the expresion of
       the 'verb':-
         nu - immediate present
         sio - would .. if  (conditional)
         du - continues  (continuous)
         fin - completed  (perfective)
  iii. Modifiers(Adverbs)
       These are substantives that describe the action,
         EG forti [strongly], celero [quickly], sine sono [silently].
   iv. Verb as Noun (Gerund)
       A Substantive may represent the action, but be in the position of
       a noun: here the Substantive has the qualities of both verb and 
       noun, and is called a Gerund; a Noun Marker (u/plu) is used to clarify 
       the syntax, if necessary, EG
        An hedo kurso. [He likes running/to run.], 
        Fe kanto es fo boni. [Her singing is very good.]
        U ju-an interese es u vola de plu modela aeroplana.
         [The boy's interest is flying model aeroplanes.] 
     v. Verb as Adjective (Participle)
        When a Verb is used to modify a Noun, the prefix ~ge-~ is placed in 
        front of the Verb to indicate that the action is received by the 
        second word, IE ge-X Y  ... where X and Y are substantives,
         EG  u ge-klude tira  [the closed door]. 
    vi. Subject and Object reversed (Passive voice)
        To form Passive Voice in Glosa, the Main Verb is converted into a
        participle, and is preceded by an Auxiliary Verb; the "actor" 
        follows the Verb Phrase as an "Indirect Subject", IE
        "recipient"(Obj.)-Auxiliary-Participle-Preposition-"actor"(Subj.)
         EG  andra           es      ge-morda      ex        kani
          ... Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.
         The Auxiliary Verb can be ~es~ [is] or ~gene~ [gets].    

7. Syntax
    The definition of syntax used for Glosa is "word order".
  S. Precedence
     Words in phrases are sequential, and there is an order of precedence
     of words in phrases, of phrases in a clause, and clauses in a 
     sentence.
    i. Precedence Rule
       This states that, within a phrase, a word is modified by the word
       immediately preceding it.  The modifying effect is cumulative 
       throughout the phrase, with the meaning of the final substantive
       being qualified addatively by all of the words preceding it in the 
       phrase.
   ii. Sequence in Phrases
      a)Noun Phrases
        Noun - Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifier(s) - 'noun'
        Marker
         EG. u   plura       tri-loba       mega      alti, rubi    flori 
      b)Verb Phrases
        Tense - Aspect  -  Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
        Part.   Part.(s)    Verb      Verb                      Verb
        EG. pa   sio        posi       es         forti         hedo
  T. Sentence Order (SVO)
     Glosa follows the majority sequence, of subject-verb-object, in the 
     structuring of its sentences.  As with English, on which Glosa 
     sentence structure is modelled, there are variations on this theme:-
   i. SV: subject-verb (intransitive 'verb'), EG  An kurso.
  ii. SVd: subject-verb-dependent_phrase, EG  Fe dice fo celero.
 iii. SVO: subject-verb-object (transitive 'verb'), EG U kani morda an.
  iv. SViO: subject-verb-indirect_object, EG Fe ki ad u boteka. 
   v. OVS: object-is_verbed_by-subject EG U kani es ge-bate ex un andra.
  U. Compounds
     Although words in Glosa do not change through usage, to generate new
     concepts, two, or more, substantives may be grouped to form a 
     compound word, and such compounds are usually joined with a hyphen.  
   i. Normal compounds are formed from two or more full substantives, EG
      kryso-buklas [golden curls,"Goldilocks"], moli-centra [soft-centered].
  ii. Regularly compounded words are abbreviated to two-letter forms, 
      called "Generic Terms", that are affixed with hyphens to the preced-
      ing substantive word, EG -do (domi)[house], kani-do [dog-house];
      -bo (boteka)[shop], pani-bo [bread shop,baker's].
  V. Concept Clusters
     Some very complex things and actions require, for their description, 
     the adjacent placement of three, or more, substantive words; however,
     this "clustering of concepts" is to be avoided, where possible, in 
     Glosa.  EG  u televideo cyklo undu genera-me
                [a television cyclic wave generator]  ... would be better
     described as ... u genera-me de cyklo undu pro televideo
                     [a generator of cyclic waves for television]. 

8. Punctuation
   Represents, in written form, the normal pauses and inflections of
   speech; and, as required (to avoid ambiguity) indicates the beginning
   of a new syntactic group.     
  W. Comma
      a)Pauses within phrase
      b)Separating equvalent syntactic elments in a phrase
      c)Pauses between phrases
      d)Separating clauses joined with a conjunction        
      e)Introducing a new phrase, where this avoids ambiguity
      f)As parenthesis for brief additional information within a phrase
  X. Semi-colon
      a)Separating equivalent clauses in a sentence
      b)Pauses between clauses
      c)Introducing a new clause, where this avoids ambiguity
  Y. Other
    i. Colon    
      a)Introducing a list comprising equivalent clauses
      b)Following a clause to indicate a consequence 
   ii. Exclamation Mark
       At the end of a sentence to add emphasis or indicates surprise.
  iii. Question Mark
       At the end of a sentence indicating the asking of a question. 
   iv. Quotation Marks 
      a)Double quotes (") around
         . Direct Speech
         . Quotations from text
         . specialised terminology
         . book titles (Alternative use on Internet: underlining _Xxx_)
                       (Alternative use in printed texts: Italics)
      b)Single quotes (') around
         . Direct Speech quoted within other Direct Speech
         . literary reference
         . special use of terminology for emphasis
    v. em dash ( - ) pauses for additional information
         . around additional information inserted as a clause
         . as a single dash for additional information at the end of the
            sentence
   vi. Brackets (xxxx xx) around
         . alternative wording
         . special explanation
         . additional information not part of the syntax of the sentence
  vii. Idiom and metaphor
       For clarity of expression across cultural boundaries these should
       be avoided in Auxiliary Language usage; however, where it is 
       necessary - for literary purposes - to quote a national-language
       idiom within Glosa, then such non-literal language ought to be
       marked with some 'neutral' symbol, EG pluvi ^plu feli e kani^.
       
9. Pronunciation
   This follows the generalised pattern of European usage. 
  Z. Phonetic Rule
     Each letter has one associated pronunciation.
     N.B. This is not automatically reversible, EG ~q~ sounds like /kw/.
  &. Vowels
     The five vowels of Glosa have Italian (or Spanish) pronunciation:
     a - AH, e - AY, i - EE, o - OR, u - OO.
 &&. Consonants 
     These follow the general pronunciation within Europe, but, where 
     consonants have alternative pronunciations, the "hard"
     pronunciation is used (g, h, j, s, z).  c is pronounced CH; y as ~i~;
     x as /ks/; w is not used; and there is no letter carrying the
     "soft" g, or "soft" j, sound.

*   Well Michael,
      I have never had the patience to try the Chat Line, but, yes, this
would be a fun way of doing language learning.
      Your enthusiasm for actual spoken language is very welcome; perhaps
some other subscribers have been waiting for you to come along with this
idea, and have been quietly practising speaking Glosa, at home, out loud.

     The way to discover Who's Who is to send the message,

To: majordomo{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au
    who glosalist

     After that you might contact people individually, though this message
goes out to all on the List.  So, anyone wishing to practice their Glosa
with Michael should contact him directly, on <avmike{at}rhinoserv{dot}com>.

     I would investigate ICQ and QTALK and try this method if I can fit it
into my day; please tell us what is involved in making the system work ..
software, mutually agreed log-on times, etc.

Saluta,
  Robin G.

Corrections:
 1. He would if he could-An sio si an sio pote.
>................................^.......-........
                         An sio akti id, si an pote.
                        (he would do it  if he can) Sorry, trick question.
                                  A.___        B._
 In English we automatically leave assumed bits out of the the sentences:
   this is called "elision"; I didn't notice I was doing it.  In an
international language however, we should have fully formed sentences -
with their Verb and Object showing.
  A. 'verb' AKTI and object ID should be there for completeness.
  B. Conditionality is passed to POTE, so a second SIO is not needed: this
is a case of "Redundancy" in English not present in Glosa.
  SI AN POTE  is really an elision of SI AN POTE AKTI ID, and this is
called an Adverbial Clause, having its own Verb Phrase (pote akti), and
modifying the .verb' in the Main Clause (akti).

   2. The man will possibly cross the road- U andra fu posi trans u via.
>.................................          /
                                           Un andra fu posi trans u via.
                                          (the man will poss. cross the r.)
                                           C._
   In Glosa,

Corrections:
 1. He would if he could-An sio si an sio pote.
>................................^.......-........
                         An sio akti id, si an pote.
                        (he would do it  if he can) Sorry, trick question.
                                  A.___        B._
 In English we automatically leave assumed bits out of the the sentences:
   this is called "elision"; I didn't notice I was doing it.  In an
nternational language however, we should have fully formed sentences -
with their Verb and Object showing.
  A. 'verb' AKTI and object ID should be there for completeness.
  B. Conditionality is passed to POTE, so a second SIO is not needed: this
is a ase of "Redundancy" in English not present in Glosa.
  SI AN POTE  is really an elision of SI AN POTE AKTI ID, and this is
called an dverbial Clause, having its own Verb Phrase (pote akti), and
modifying the .verb' in the Main Clause (akti).

   2. The man will possibly cross the road- U andra fu posi trans u via.
>.................................          /
                                           Un andra fu posi trans u via.
                                          (the man will poss. cross the r.)
                                           C._
   In Glosa, for ease of speech, an "n" is added to U before a following
vowel.
   Similarly a "d" is added to A before a following vowel: UN ANDRA KI AD
ERGO.

  3. He ought to get it.- An debi gene id.
>......................................... tick
*   In English we have a lot of confusion between "to" as a preposition and
as the former of the Infinitive: this is a case in point; it could be
tricky to decide which word, "ought" or "get", the "to" goes with.  Such a
problem does not arise in Glosa, but there is a logical "to" as well, given
by TE - in order to.

>  4. Will he go to the shop?-Qe an fu ki ad u boteka?
>...............................^.........................tick~
                              Qe, an fu ki ad u boteka?
   It does seem neater to bracket that initial QE off from the rest of the
sentence with a comma; also, it follows the vocal inflection.

>  5. Could he cross the road to get it? Qe  sio pote trans u via gene id?
>....................................      ^^                    ^
                                   Qe, an sio pote trans u via te gene id?
                               (Q: he would can cross the road in / get it)
                                                             order to
  The sentence needs a Subject, in this case it is AN.  The use of GENE,
here, is not as a simple Infinitive, so TE is called into play.

>  6. The man should give it to the shop-keeper.- U andra sio debi gene id
>ad u boteka-propio-pe.                           /                x
>............................ tick~
                         Un andra sio debi don id ad u boteka-proprio-pe.
                       (the man would ought to_give it to the shop_owner)
   DONA - to give, is shortened to DON when followed by a vowel .. purely
for the sake of ease of pronunciation.

>  7. He might give the shop-owner the money?- An sio posi gene u
>boteka-proprio-pe u valuta                                x
>............................... tick
     This will be understandable, but,
                    An sio posi don u valuta ad u boteka-proprio-pe.
                 (he would possibly give the money to the shop_keeper)
                  NP.     Verb Phrase   .  NP     : Prepositional Phrase
               Subject   -   Verb   -    Object   &   Indirect Object
has clearer syntax.

  8. Will he get the book today? Qe  fu gene u bibli nu-di?
>..................................^^.......
                                 Qe, an fu gene u bibli, nu-di?
                                (Q: he will get the book to-day)
    The Subject, AN, is necessary for the full sentence.

  9. He should get the book, to-day.- An sio debi gene u bibli nu-di.
>....................................... tick

  10. Perhaps he will go to the shop across the road.- Sio posi fu ki ad u
>boteka trans u via.                                  ^         <-
>......^................. Sorry, another trick question.
   EITHER:  An sio posi fu ki ad u boteka; trans u via.  ........ A.
       OR:  Posi, an fu sio ki ad u boteka; qi es trans u via. .. B.

    (possibly he in_future would go to the shop, which is across the road)

   A. retains the English-language syntactic structure; while B., using
Glosa's (native) syntax splits the "perhaps" function (~sio~ & ~posi~) into

its parts, putting the words in the Verb Phrase into their more normal
sequence for Glosa, and it also expands the elided final Noun Clause - by
inserting the missing QI ES after the start_of_clause marker, ";".

    In all, Michael, a pretty good first attempt at translation into Glosa,
especially considering I omitted a few words from the headlined vocabulary
(DONA, ES, QI).
    In future exercises, I will also try to avoid including hidden traps.

    For future exercises, I hope to see more people sending in attempts at
translation.  If you are SHY, please blip me directly, and I will not
correct your work publicly, on the List; otherwise, it's first come, first
served, and I publish corrections and a standard translation on Glosalist.

Saluta,
 Robin G.

I've subscribed but haven't received any mails so I don't know if this list
is active. I've tried to download the dictionaries from Robin Gaskells site,
but they are encrypted and for >glossalist eyes only< (apparently). So here
I am on the glossalist and am wondering how to access the dictionaries.

I've been swimming (or drowning) in information on the net about various
conlangs and auxlangs. The two that have peaked my interest are interlingua
and glossa, so here I am.
One reason why glossa looks interesting to me is that I have studied chinese
in the past and am currently studying classical greek, so the idea of
putting them together is intriguing. Interlingua looks interesting because
it seems to be readable straight off. But I do love Greek so glossa beckons
me...

Ave!

Mi pa gene posta ex Robin nu-di. Gratia de tu grama!

I received mail from Robin today, and thank God for that, because I had
forgotten about my Glosa interest since my first and only letter. The
reason will partially answer Robin's question about what are my
interests in interlanguage.

In the first place, my interest comes, of course, from international
communications and understanding, and I think I have no need to explain
further this.

I started, as it usually happens, with Esperanto, because it has had "a
lot" of "publicity", but mainly because I knew of the existence of a
free (mi ne habe valuta :( ) course of ten lessons through  e-mail.
I started the course during this Easter. But as soon as I got to the
third lesson, I thought: "I'm doing well with it, but this language has
TOO many things I don't like. I think it would be quite better if
it...", and I proposed to myself (informally) some solutions to the
limitations I saw in Esperanto. I remembered I had a book of
linguistics readers for anthropology students, that has an article on
Planned Auxiliary Languages. Despite of this title, in the article the
writer (a quite clumsy one) actually just "defends" (lamely) Esperanto
from the "attacks" of an Idist who "dared to say that Ido was better",
and cited the "supposed" improvements of Ido over Esperanto. It was very
funny for me to realize that the Idist improvements were quite exactly
the ones I thought Esperanto needed. So I joined inmediately an Idist
mailing list and contacted them to get some more information.

But both Esperanto and Ido are pretty much the same: the
"archaic" and "modern" forms of a completely European language. And that
I can not accept as International, Neutral, nor Auxiliary.

That same day in early may, since I couldn't get more information
out of my books, I went to the net. Researched through it, and with
godspeed found Glosa... (I'll get back with you later).

After some very harsh collisions with weird Esperantists that even
spammed me with threats and insults, and I never knew why... I finished
the Esperanto course the firt week of May, and started to throughly use
the language. I devoted 15 hours a day for it... until last week.

The first day of June, I created a mailing list, with the main goal of
getting Venezuelan Esperantists together through the net, since the
Venezuela Esperanto-Asocio doesn't atract any people to its see (and
you'll know why later in this letter... it's a creepy tale), but I
didn't announce it until June the 19th (not even two weeks ago!).
The first days of May I
contacted the Association, and asked for permission to build them a
website, although I knew nothing about HTML. I myself, alone, started
the construction, staying late up transcribing Venezuelans magazines and
literary works in Esperanto for the web page... I even got terrible head
and back aches (I still have 'em!) because of no sleeping nor resting.
Three days after announcing the creation of the group, at least 25
Esperantists from all the world had joined the list. The website was
launched. I was very happy, I had already forgotten the weird actions of
the weird esperantists.

An important member of the Universal Esperanto Association "awarded" me
with a membership to that organization because of my "seminal" work.

A nice Bielorussian Esperantist guy who was also an Idist I knew from
the Idist list, joined the Venezuelan Group.

I was very pleased, I said. "Althought almost all Idists are or were
Esperantists first, very few of today Esperantists have heard about Ido,
because past Esperantists said it was a heresy and declared them
enemies. Dear friend, your presence in our list pleases me very much. It
gives us a wonderful opportunity to tell Esperantists about Ido, and
show them that it is its ally. Despite the fact that Esperanto and Ido
are European languages, limiting their universality, I think Ido has a
lot of advantages over Esperanto, that could be praised."

Well, damn me for saying that, because the officialist Esperanto
position is the same as in the past, and they proved to be hypocrytes.
You could say I was shot with machine guns and bombed with shrapnel! I
was a "heresiarch", a "schismatic", and "enemy". "We declare war upon
you! Esperanto is the only international language for the world!".

I explained that I was not promoting Ido, but mentioning it. And I also
explained again that those two languages where in all aspects Europeans,
and pretending to make it the international language was a very
eurocentrical, ethnocentrical, racist goal.

Things got much worse. Much much worse. The discussion heated, the
attacks grew. I insisted in being a defender of the non-European
language speaking Underdogs. I demanded true neutrality and that the UEA
must recognize and permit the study and research of other
interlanguages.

Well, I condemned myself to hell, then. If you hear that Esperanto and
UEA respect and back Human Rights, let me tell you that by my experience
that seems to be a lie, since the war against me was declared by the
Vicepresident of the Venezuelan Association and the UEA's commissionate
for International Affairs.

I have gone into "exile". I use the "", because I'm actually still
there, under a pseudonym I created for defending me during the weird
events of the course. So effective I have been, that I have regained
quickly control over the group again, under the appearance of my alter
ego (I kind of feel like Zorro!). My alter ego was made by "its"
request manager of the group, since the Venezuelan Esperantist Leaders
are a bunch of very bitter and very old males that don't know how to use
the internet resources properly, and needed help from such well
respected "samideano" (my alter ego! Ha ha!). It seems that I have
succeeded at least on making them go silent, since I made them noticed
that the membership to the list was decaying, I've have defended very
well my ideas! Now even my original self seems to be respected, and as
the "other" I'm working on my triumphant return! God, it feels good to
be the good guy!

Such a strange world! I have never felt hate, but the pain was so big,
that I found five grey hairs growing in my 22-years old head this morning.

So that was what was keeping me away from Glosa. If I hadn't received
Robin's letter, I'd have forgotten Glosa, at least until next week.
Thanks, Robin!

Now, what are my hopes for Glosa?

Well, there are so many hopes! This is a language that really DOES
pleases me!

(And believe me, I have researched a lot about another interlanguages,
like Interlingua, Occidental, Novial, Loglan/Lobjan, Lingua Franca Nova,
Vorlin, etc. I even studied Volapuk today! And it's not as ridiculous as
Esperantists want it to be!)

I think that Glosa's grammar makes it (much, much, very much) easier
than any of those languages I mentioned. Not having inflexion makes it
great, and very international. All human groups, I think, can handle
this type of language, while inflectible and the other(s) are hard even
for those who speak it natively. I think I'll never get my own Spanish
right, but I have great hopes about Glosa!

The phonetic is pleasing, very pleasing (Oh, I finally got rid of that
horrible sounding Esperanto, so harsh, so difficult to Caribbeans like
me... so unpleasant... so full of stressed "i"s... it sounded like
losing on Jeopardy!).

I like the use of nu, pa, etc. for tenses, and I believe it deserves
religious praise!

The use of -lo, -pe, -ru, etc., kind of reminds me of African languages,
and are much better and more recognizable that things like the European
suffixes.

Oh, so many things I like!

Let me offer myself for Glosa! As soon as I learn it right, let me
spread the word about it in Spanish! I'm at your orders for translating
any information from English. I can't offer quickness, but you will get
hard work!

Robin, gratia de tu ofero! But I don't want to be abusive with you.
Remember that I live in Venezuela. Isn't mail expensive? (Or are we
Venezuelans too cheap?) I will only accept it if you guarantee it is not
a bother for you. So, here is my address:

Daniel Alegrett
Av. Sucre, Res. Yutaje, Torre D, Apto D-284. Los Dos Caminos, Caracas
1071, Venezuela.

Remember, only if it doesn't bother you! Gratia de tu kura e de tu auxi.

Although my main concern in Anthropology is Biological Anthropology
(still archaically being called "Physical" by a lot of National
Schools), in that field my main interest is the effect of Culture in the
Biological Nature of Man. "Man didn't create Culture. Culture created
Man". So, I guess it would enormously interesting to see the biological
effect of the use of a international auxiliary language that will make
brothers real brothers at last!

Mi fu habe poli amiki, kausa Glosa.

Gratia de vi tem.

A vi sinceri,

Daniel.

Saluta all..

I got on this list a while ago. I've been side tracked by my own language
project which isn't going as planned, and I've learned a bit of INterlingua
in the process, but reading Daniel's letter, has given me the interest in
making a possible go at Glosa.

So, what can we do here to get this list stinking active!!!

One thing I played with was trying to sort the vocabulary into
semantic fields, to a greater degree than on Paul's page:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/glosaref.html

I used HTML form listboxes to collect all the animals, plants, etc.
But it is quite a task. The goal would be an easy Glosa-text-generator.
The first IAL to devise a good Java interface to generate and parse,
will win. That is sort-of the goal of the UNL project, which has
financing and a 10-year plan. Sounds really important ...

http://www.ias.unu.edu/project_99/unl.asp

There is also a project by James Chandler on the AUXLANG list
to migrate Ido/Novial in the direction of a pidgin/creole,
effectively Glosa. I made a web page of a combined vocabulary:

Thanks for your support, and let's thank ourselves for waking up our
interest for Glosa.

I much fear that my internet access will be somewhat limited to e-mail
until october, unless I wake up at 3 AM and use it until 6 AM,
in order to have free access from my own. This is because I've moved
from Chemistry School (where I had free access to the internet) to
Anthropology School (where there's no access to the net) and the
university made me "quit" to my old Faculty and "suspended" me.
(They make all things sound so ugly) I'll not be a student of my
university until september, and I will have my very own access to the
internet the next month, when the Engineering Faculty (provider of
internet access for those faculties that don't have one) comes back from
its vacations.

Oh, in explaining such burocratic fiascos, I forgot to explain why this
situation bothers me. It's because maybe I won't be able to read or
study any Glosa text or information in the net for a while. Just because
that. But that's terrible.

Of course, I won't suffer if we "get this stinking list working",
according Michael's beautiful words, and start writing about Glosa
and/or in Glosa here.

After 15 minutes checking the Basic Reference text in the net, here is
my first attempt at using Glosa, in a translation from a ramdomly picked
text in an anthology of Spanish vanguardist writers (1925-1935). So, let
me know if I'm using the language right. Also, the basic reference text
doesn't tell much about using the indirect object. I have not studied
yet a tale that Robin included in the first letter sent to me. I think
it was Goldilocks. Nor I have studied the Shakespeare text in the net.
So, for this I got help only from the Basic Reference text.

"Mu pa taci; e Teo pa dice:
Mi ne pa veni homo Teo ad u Geo, sed homo u homini. E mi volu es;
seqe-co; vive ko plu homini kon alelo. Ka-co qi fu pa gene mi favo; qi
nu monstra maxi homini. Tu pa monstra homo homini; po tu ofero mi frigi
bibe-citri. Ka-co tu nu gene mi favo. Tu du es homini; tu ne tenti ki ad
ana; ne tenti ki a su tu. Co ne es ki ad ana; sed co es ki ad
'kata'..."

A re-vide,

Daniel.

    I quote the relationship between English and Glosa thus: one can
translate a Glosa sentence almost word for word into English, but the
reverse is not true.

    Tem mi grafo uti plu bi lingua, mi prima grafo u Glosa, po-co, mi

Ave!

Robin, what news of the 2.5K Dictionary and the Grammar that you've been
working on for Glosa? How about some more translation exercise posts? I was
enjoying tackling them.

I've been planning to do a semantic field ordering of the vocabulary too -
but have been waiting for the new words. How far have others got with this?

Nick

I made a HTML page with pull-down menus for each field,
acting as a rough 1-click dictionary. But it isn't easy
to categorize most words. Animals, plants, tools, OK.
Basic verbs and qualities, um, OK. Most words are
cultural fuzzy things, like "foreign" or "free",
which are not so easy. I didn't finish it ...

the feel for the language.  Mathematically, I would say PRACTICE >
SCHOLARSHIP when it comes to gaining a feel for, and fluency in, Glosa.

    It is unfortunate that the virus struck my computer with the Grammar
completed, and work done on adding "omissions' and compiling tha 2500-word
NetGlosa list.  I will try to find copies of this work in my disks, but if
anyone can resend copies of these to me, directly, as they circulated on
the List, I would appreciate it.  My next three-week holiday starts at the
end of this week, and I will make a priority of bringing these sundry
projects to completion.  Thank you.

    But, as John says, "write as much [Glosa] as you are able."

Saluta,
  Robin

*   This enthusiasm is very warming.  I will suggest that at the start, you
might translate some of the promotional information on Glosa from English
to Spanish, thank you.  This can be copied directly from the Author's
leaflets, or might be modified and updated, to suit South American culture
and linguistic needs.  I should include some copies of Richmond leaflets
with the posting of the Dictionary Disk.

*   Sounds fair!  There has been an idea around .. for some time .. in
Linguistics,  called the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, in which it is suggested
that the Language a person speaks shapes their thinking process.  Although
it is widely believed that this could be true, it is generally agreed that
no suitable experiment can be set up to test the hypothesis.  Even though the
Alegrett Hypothesis may be a special case of S-W, it might be possible to
experimentally test a hypothesis, which states that an auxiliary language
that aids clarity of thought, does, in fact, increase 'pro humanity'
attitudes among its users.

   The "Culture" <---> "Mankind" puzzle takes some thinking, but I think
you are right: a clearly defined set of 'rules for living' is needed before
a group of  Homo sapiens  makes it to 'Mankind' status.

   I think you have a solid hypothesis to work on, here.  And, there is a
reasonable chance that, in using Glosa as the language vehicle, we can
conduct experiment(s) which show that use of such a language actually does
produce a significant difference!

Subject: How to Get This List Going!?
To: Glosalist Mailing List
Date: Sun, 18 Jul 99 20:5

Saluta a mi plu amika,
   Recento, mi pa nece akti in un alterno area, e ne pa grafo a vi, membra
de u-ci Lista.
   Sed, nu, mi vo kontinu un ergo de promoti Glosa, sed ko ma vigo.

   Pluso-co, bi membra de u Lista pa forti-dice de auxi un ergo de disemina
u nova de Glosa.  Vi posi pa lekto mu kontribu.

   Fo mali, mi pa celero lekto u posta de mo Glosalist-pe; qi qestio, "Qe,
qod na pote akti te renova u-ci Lista?" .. e mi nu ne pote detekti u-ci
mesage intra plu fila de mi puta-me.
   So, tem mi pa lose u nima de u-ci Glosa-pe - pro qi mi don apologi - mi
dice a holo plu membra de u Lista: ja, u Glosalist ki in un aktivi-ergo fasi.

   Seqe-co, mi fu koncentra aktivi in un uti de Glosa, vice diskursi plu
detaila de exakto gramatika e plu verbi-lista.  Akorda, u regulari forma de
u lingua sio debi gene ge-uti, e na fu tosto kompleti u 2500 verbi lista ..
speciali pro uti dia un Inter-reti.
   Anti-co, na pote uti u "Glosa 6000" diktionari pre u publika de u '2.5K
Reti-Glosa.'
   Si tu ne habe u 6000-verbi diska, sed vo habe id, place posta tu
landa-adrese a mi, so mi pote bali u kopi de u-ci diska a tu.  Habe tri ma
seti-mana, de mi libetem, komence nu, mi fu forti ergo in prepara plu itema
pro u Lista.

   E nu, te deskribe plu akti; qi mi pote uti, mi fu sti grafo uti
England-lingua te evita ali posi no-logi .. e ka poli de plu verbi, pro
plu-ci idea, a-nu, ne existe in u ge-tipo Glosa lexiko.

   Just what can we do to get the Glosalist moving!?

   a. One thing is to widen the subscribership: but numbers of people,
alone, do not make an active List.
     (i)  Daniel Alegrett can render the Glosa info into Spanish, and if he
creates a Website that is basically in Spanish - but which also has links
to English-language sites - we broaden the user-base.
     (ii) With Glosa info in Spanish and English, people who are not
natlang bilingual, will be instead 'auxlingual' and will thus be able to
demonstrate communication across the national language 'barrier.'
     (iii) There is a Glosa 1000 printed dictionary in Spanish: the authors
will allow us to use this.
     (iv) Subsequently, we might be able to mesh-in Webpages prepared by
Glosa-pe from other linguo-cultural groups.

   b. My stress with Glosa exercises on the Glosalist will be increasingly
in the direction of spoken and auditary fluency.
      (v) The need for a number of Glosa cassettes now becomes pressing.
      (vi) Comprehension written exercises are needed, as well as short
sentences for translation.
      (vii) Glosa-pe will be encouraged to attempt more creaive writing.

   c. Exercises from a wide range of human experience are needed.
      (viii) Different subscribers can send in their own exercises, and
these can be from a range of situations, such as:
    . Questions
    . Science
    . Emotive language
    . Logical argument
    . Reportage
    . "Vernacular" - polte conversation
    . Cultural exchange of information
      (ix) To make the List more fun - as well as translation from English
to Glosa, and vice-versa - we can mix the exercises up a bit, such as:
      > Identifying deliberate erros.
      > Questions .. write answers.
      > Answers .. write suitable questions.
      (x) Ggroup writing of stories and items to make up a Primer.
      (xi) Telling jokes in Glosa?
      (xii) Pooling ideas for disseminating and teaching Glosa.
      (xiii) ....... etc.

      I would like to see Glosalist jumping with ideas and subscribers'
Glosa scripts.

Saluta,
  Robin

>       d)Adverbial Phrase: small group with a modifier, amplifying the
>         meaning of the 'verb'; can be one word at the start or end of

>         sentence.
>   iii. Phrases in a simple sentence follow the Subject+Verb(+Object)

>       a)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase ... with Intransitive 'verb'.
>       b)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Noun Phrase ... Transitive 'verb'.
>       c)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Prepositional Phrase .. 'verb' has

>         Object.
>    iv. Glosa phrases are "Substantive Final", starting with the least

>        ively to extend the meaning of the substantive, which comes last.
>   C. Clauses
>      i. A Glosa sentence with only one 'verb' is a Major Clause.
>     ii. With two, or more 'verbs' in a sentence, there is one Major
>clause,
>         with the other 'verb(s)' usually in Minor Clauses that add meaning
>         to the Major Clause.
>    iii. Two, or more, Major Clauses may be combined in a sentence through

>     iv. Where ambiguity is otherwise possible, a semi-colon is used as a
>         Start-of-Clause Marker.
>      v. There are three types of Minor Clause in Glosa:-
>        a)Noun Clause: larger group that takes the place of a Noun Phrase.
>        b)Adjectival Clause: larger group usually starting with the
>Relative
>          Pronoun, ~qi~, and following the 'noun' it adds meaning to.
>        c)Adverbial Clause: larger group, that could be anywhere in the
>          sentence, but which extends the meaning of the main verb of the
>          sentence.  These start with a word that places or explains  the

>      a)First person: mi [I], na [we]
>      b)Second Person: tu [you(singular)], vi [you(plural)]
>      c)Third Person: an [he], fe [she], pe [a person], mu [them]
>   ii. Impersonal Pronouns: u-ci [this], u-la [that]
>  iii. Relative Pronoun (Adjectival Clause Marker): qi [which,that]
>   L. Determinants and Numerators
>      These are particles that tell about the quantitative nature of the
>      'noun', and are placed at the start of the Noun Phrase.
>    i. Noun Markers: u [=a,the], plu [=the](indicates plurality); these
>       can be omitted, if context, or other words in the NP, clearly
>       indicate the presence of the 'noun'
>   ii. Countables
>       Countables exist in discrete numbers, and may be described using:
>      a)Numbers: mo [one], bi [two], deka [ten], bi-tri [twenty-three].
>      b)General terms: oligo [few], poly [many], mega, [big], pusi [small].
>       plura [several],
>  iii. Quantifiers
>       Substances that are Measured, not Counted, are described using:
>       u mero de [a piece of], ma [more], meio [less], maxi [most],
>       u qantita de [an amount of].
>   M. Noun Modifiers
>      Substantives functioning as nouns may be modifies qualitatively by
>      other substantives placed directly before them.
>     i. Adjectives: This is the traditional term for Noun Modifiers.
>    ii. Compounding: When two, or more, substantives combine, often
>        hyphenated, to form one complex concept, they modify the meaning of
>        one another.
>         EG trans-natio-korporati [TNC]
>
>6. Verb Phrases
>      A simple sentence has one Verb Phrase in the middle of the sentence:
>      the final word in a V.P. is a substantive acting as a verb.
>    i. A single 'verb' can constitute a Verb Phrase.
>   ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of particles and modifiers,
>       as well as the final substantive 'verb', in a Verb Phrase.
>   N. Substantive as 'verb'
>      In a V.P. one substantive functions as the verb.
>     i. The 'verb' represents the action associated with the substantive.
>    ii. The substantive is not modified to show that it acts as a verb.
>   iii. 'verbs' in Glosa are not inflected.
>    iv. The substantive 'verb' is the final word in the V.P. being
>        preceded in the phrase by particles and modifiers.
>   O. Auxiliary Verbs
>      These substantive - capable of acting as verbs on their own - precede
>      the main 'verb' and augment its meaning.  These are: es [being,is],
>      habe [has_the_quality_of,"is"], gene [gets,becomes,"is"].
>   P. Modal Verbs
>      These are lesser 'verbs' that usually precede the main 'verb'
>      modifying how it acts.  These are: posi [possibly], pote [can],
>      debi [ought to], nece [must], probabili [probably].
>   Q. Phrasal Verbs
>      A Phrasal Verb comprises a substantive 'verb' followed by one (or
>      more) "post-positions" that extend the meaning of the 'verb'.
>       EG,  ki ana  [go up], moti ab  [move away from], loka antero [put
>          in front of]
>   R. Verb Modifiers
>      The 'verb'is the final word in the V.P., and any word before the
>      substantive 'verb' modifies that 'verb'. The modifiers in a V.P.
>      follow a sequence of increasing importance to the meaning of the
>      phrase:-
>         Tense - Aspect - Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
>     i. Tense Particles
>        Strictly speaking there are two Tense particles:-
>         pa - Past Tense
>         -    Present Tense
>         fu - Future Tense
>         The default for a 'verb' not marked for tense is Present Tense.
>    ii. Aspect Particles
>        A number of other words relating to the timing or intention of the
>        action can come after the Tense particle to extend the expresion of
>        the 'verb':-
>          nu - immediate present
>          sio - would .. if  (conditional)
>          du - continues  (continuous)
>          fin - completed  (perfective)
>   iii. Modifiers(Adverbs)
>        These are substantives that describe the action,
>          EG forti [strongly], celero [quickly], sine sono [silently].
>    iv. Verb as Noun (Gerund)
>        A Substantive may represent the action, but be in the position of
>        a noun: here the Substantive has the qualities of both verb and
>        noun, and is called a Gerund; a Noun Marker (u/plu) is used to
>clarify
>        the syntax, if necessary, EG
>         An hedo kurso. [He likes running/to run.],
>         Fe kanto es fo boni. [Her singing is very good.]
>         U ju-an interese es u vola de plu modela aeroplana.
>          [The boy's interest is flying model aeroplanes.]
>      v. Verb as Adjective (Participle)
>         When a Verb is used to modify a Noun, the prefix ~ge-~ is placed
>in
>         front of the Verb to indicate that the action is received by the
>         second word, IE ge-X Y  ... where X and Y are substantives,
>          EG  u ge-klude tira  [the closed door].
>     vi. Subject and Object reversed (Passive voice)
>         To form Passive Voice in Glosa, the Main Verb is converted into a
>         participle, and is preceded by an Auxiliary Verb; the "actor"
>         follows the Verb Phrase as an "Indirect Subject", IE
>         "recipient"(Obj.)-Auxiliary-Participle-Preposition-"actor"(Subj.)
>          EG  andra           es      ge-morda      ex        kani
>           ... Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.
>          The Auxiliary Verb can be ~es~ [is] or ~gene~ [gets].
>
>7. Syntax
>     The definition of syntax used for Glosa is "word order".
>   S. Precedence
>      Words in phrases are sequential, and there is an order of precedence
>      of words in phrases, of phrases in a clause, and clauses in a
>      sentence.
>     i. Precedence Rule
>        This states that, within a phrase, a word is modified by the word
>        immediately preceding it.  The modifying effect is cumulative
>        throughout the phrase, with the meaning of the final substantive
>        being qualified addatively by all of the words preceding it in the
>        phrase.
>    ii. Sequence in Phrases
>       a)Noun Phrases
>         Noun - Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifier(s) - 'noun'
>         Marker
>          EG. u   plura       tri-loba       mega      alti, rubi    flori
>       b)Verb Phrases
>         Tense - Aspect  -  Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
>         Part.   Part.(s)    Verb      Verb                      Verb
>         EG. pa   sio        posi       es         forti         hedo
>   T. Sentence Order (SVO)
>      Glosa follows the majority sequence, of subject-verb-object, in the
>      structuring of its sentences.  As with English, on which Glosa
>      sentence structure is modelled, there are variations on this theme:-
>    i. SV: subject-verb (intransitive 'verb'), EG  An kurso.
>   ii. SVd: subject-verb-dependent_phrase, EG  Fe dice fo celero.
>  iii. SVO: subject-verb-object (transitive 'verb'), EG U kani morda an.
>   iv. SViO: subject-verb-indirect_object, EG Fe ki ad u boteka.
>    v. OVS: object-is_verbed_by-subject EG U kani es ge-bate ex un andra.
>   U. Compounds
>      Although words in Glosa do not change through usage, to generate new
>      concepts, two, or more, substantives may be grouped to form a
>      compound word, and such compounds are usually joined with a hyphen.
>    i. Normal compounds are formed from two or more full substantives, EG
>       kryso-buklas [golden curls,"Goldilocks"], moli-centra
>[soft-centered].
>   ii. Regularly compounded words are abbreviated to two-letter forms,
>       called "Generic Terms", that are affixed with hyphens to the preced-
>       ing substantive word, EG -do (domi)[house], kani-do [dog-house];
>       -bo (boteka)[shop], pani-bo [bread shop,baker's].
>   V. Concept Clusters
>      Some very complex things and actions require, for their description,
>      the adjacent placement of three, or more, substantive words; however,
>      this "clustering of concepts" is to be avoided, where possible, in
>      Glosa.  EG  u televideo cyklo undu genera-me
>                 [a television cyclic wave generator]  ... would be better
>      described as ... u genera-me de cyklo undu pro televideo
>                      [a generator of cyclic waves for television].
>
>8. Punctuation
>    Represents, in written form, the normal pauses and inflections of
>    speech; and, as required (to avoid ambiguity) indicates the beginning
>    of a new syntactic group.
>   W. Comma
>       a)Pauses within phrase
>       b)Separating equvalent syntactic elments in a phrase
>       c)Pauses between phrases
>       d)Separating clauses joined with a conjunction
>       e)Introducing a new phrase, where this avoids ambiguity
>       f)As parenthesis for brief additional information within a phrase
>   X. Semi-colon
>       a)Separating equivalent clauses in a sentence
>       b)Pauses between clauses
>       c)Introducing a new clause, where this avoids ambiguity
>   Y. Other
>     i. Colon
>       a)Introducing a list comprising equivalent clauses
>       b)Following a clause to indicate a consequence
>    ii. Exclamation Mark
>        At the end of a sentence to add emphasis or indicates surprise.
>   iii. Question Mark
>        At the end of a sentence indicating the asking of a question.
>    iv. Quotation Marks
>       a)Double quotes (") around
>          . Direct Speech
>          . Quotations from text
>          . specialised terminology
>          . book titles (Alternative use on Internet: underlining _Xxx_)
>                        (Alternative use in printed texts: Italics)
>       b)Single quotes (') around
>          . Direct Speech quoted within other Direct Speech
>          . literary reference
>          . special use of terminology for emphasis
>     v. em dash ( - ) pauses for additional information
>          . around additional information inserted as a clause
>          . as a single dash for additional information at the end of the
>             sentence
>    vi. Brackets (xxxx xx) around
>          . alternative wording
>          . special explanation
>          . additional information not part of the syntax of the sentence
>   vii. Idiom and metaphor
>        For clarity of expression across cultural boundaries these should
>        be avoided in Auxiliary Language usage; however, where it is
>        necessary - for literary purposes - to quote a national-language
>        idiom within Glosa, then such non-literal language ought to be
>        marked with some 'neutral' symbol, EG pluvi ^plu feli e kani^.
>
>9. Pronunciation
>    This follows the generalised pattern of European usage.
>   Z. Phonetic Rule
>      Each letter has one associated pronunciation.
>      N.B. This is not automatically reversible, EG ~q~ sounds like /kw/.
>   &. Vowels
>      The five vowels of Glosa have Italian (or Spanish) pronunciation:
>      a - AH, e - AY, i - EE, o - OR, u - OO.
>  &&. Consonants
>      These follow the general pronunciation within Europe, but, where
>      consonants have alternative pronunciations, the "hard"
>      pronunciation is used (g, h, j, s, z).  c is pronounced CH; y as ~i~;
>      x as /ks/; w is not used; and there is no letter carrying the
>      "soft" g, or "soft" j, sound.

Friends,

repost them directly, to me, at   rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au   thank you.

   Silly story: I pressed the wrong button - or, rather, failed to press
the right button - between "Recieving" mail into my RAM, and "Transferring"

Hi,
I am sending this email to everyone in my email address book as I thought it

If you work for a company who is not aware of this, it could help!
Apologies to anyone who already knew/was not interested.
Maybe if you send this to as many people as you know, we can avoid quite a

Subject: Small problem and fix for a Y2K glitch

  After running a quick little test, much to my surprise, I learned
that both of my computers would have failed on 01-01-2000 due to a
computer clock glitch. Fortunately, a quick fix is provided:

  Double click on "My Computer".

  Double click on "Control Panel".

  Double click on "Regional Settings" icon.

  Click on the "Date" tab at the top of the page.

  Where it says, "Short Date Sample", look and see if it shows a "two
digit" year. Of course it does. That's the default setting for Windows
95, Windows 98 and NT. This date RIGHT HERE is the date that feeds
application software and WILL NOT rollover in the year 2000. It will
roll over to 00.

  Click on the button across from "Short Date Style" and select the
option that shows, mm/dd/yyyy. (Be sure your selection has four Y's
showing, not two) Then click on "Apply" and then click on "OK" at the
bottom. Easy enough to fix. However, every single installation of
Windows worldwide is defaulted to fail Y2K rollover.

  How many people know about it? How many people know to change that?
What will be the effect? Who knows. But this is another example of the
pervasiveness and systemic nature of the problem.

  As far as MAC users, you will have to contact the dealers to see if
there is a similar problem and fix.

IGLOS - The International Glossary

This "International Glossary" is a project in construction. It is offered as
is and with the hope that any users might volunteer corrections to its
entries. Yes, there may quite a few needed corrections and this is where
making the file available may benefit all using it through constant
revisions and updates. The latest revision is dated 1999.07.26 - This
revision includes added English / Interlingua terms and meanings, plus
incorporates simple translations into French, German, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish.

The file is almost 700k in zipped up form. When uncompressed it is over 2
megabytes.

Any help or suggestions are gladly received.

    Were I to suggest adding Glosa to the repertoire, this would only tend
to compound the size problem.

Robin,

    I moved the Glosa world wide web pages off of GeoCities because of
their new policy after having been taken over by Yahoo! and the issues
of copyright.  As an interim measure I moved them to my own service
provider.  However, I have only a finite amount of disk space before I
have to pay a surcharge.  Also, as you are aware, I am no longer an
active supporter of Glosa.  If you know of someone who would be willing
to take the pages over intact, I would prefer to relinquish them and
reclaim the disk space for personal use.

Mi Plu Amika,
  Paul has been very helpful in the past with Glosa, but now he is moving
on.
  He set up an excellent site for Glosa webpages, and these are well known.
  Now he wishes to off-load this info from his system, so I am seeking
another, who would take these pages on.
  If you might be interested, please visit Paul's site to see what yoou
could be gaining.  Knowing Paul's attiitudes, I imagine that he feels the
complete site should be transferred, IN ITS ENTIRITY, to another location.
Of course, it can be upgraded and personalised to suit the temperament of a
new owner.

  Paul's reference to copyright laws is not a real worry.  There is nothing
that the Glosa authors would object to.  The only item they have banned
from the Internet is the Glosa 6000 dictionary, and I send this per
computer disk to Glosalist subscribers, on request.

  If yoou are interested, please send me a message abouut it.  I have told
Paul I will treat the request as uurgent.

Saluta,
   Robin

Saluta Robin,
The file is 700k in zipped form.
2Mb. in extracted form
will give you English, Interlingua,
French, German, Spanish,
Italian and Portuguese...

it is by no means a finished product
by which I mean some terms
need to be added... the full project
also includes the Esperanto
terms up till letter F, the Volapuk
terms up to M and Latino sine
Flexione pretty much completed...
I'm also including Ekspreso
terms and considering Novial and
or Interlingue/Occidental.
Glosa would be a great addition!
The longer the file gets the
more unwieldly (sp?) it becomes,
though. What are the copyright
restrictions on making lists
available for Glosa words???

I can appreciate how the size
may hinder some from using
the iGLOS. I can always truncate
a special request list...
it is very easy to extract...
an English / Interlingua section
could become its own glossary
easily. This will cut down on
the size considerably. If you wish...
I can make one available.
at the site... just give me a couple
of days. :-)

Also a possibility is cutting the
glossary into alphabetical sections
thus the pieces would be smaller
and more manageable. But a
great advantage of having it all
as a big file is being able to
surf around in it hunting from
term to term and at your whim
jumping from one letter section to
another noticing the similarities
and derivations in vocabulary.
It's research value is what I'm
really interested in. However
there is some housekeeping
still needed and the file will keep
improving with use.

So, give me a couple of days and
I'll try to post a smaller version... or
even versions... if there is interest
like one natural language and an
IAL selections. etc...

Since,
Jay B.

Saluta,
I have found two providers of free space to
be very accomodating... one is Intercosmos.com
and the other is Webjump.com . I like the set up
with Intercosmos better because you can easily
view pages as you've sent them without annoying
blinking banners... the only ads are a pop up window
a la Geocities. With Webjump you have to have the
ability of seeing frames... which of course show ad
banners.

Try out intercosmos.com... If you wish I could arrange
an account there... and give access to change to
whoever will be maintaining the pages.

   I for one am unable to see frames (though that MAY change in

    Two questions on your e-post:
  . was your message on a half-width column for a reason?
  . though your e-address is  jjbowks{at}cheshire{dot}net  when do you use the
@adam.cheshhire.net  form in your "Return Address"?

    I take it that it is now safe to tell Paul Bartlett that he can clear
his Website of the Glosa pages; perhaps you have already done this.

Cc: Robin Gaskell

Ave!

Robin, I received the disk today.

I have not been able to take part in Glosalist because: 1) the
hostilities with the Esperantists got pretty ugly and that has consumed
much of my time and energy (I am somewhat exhausted), and 2) I am
currently without phone service (My mum owes an awful lot of money to
the company) since three weeks ago. I have been barely able to follow
what has been happening in the list using my dad's laptop (that's why
the sender appears as "Luis Alberto Alegrett") from other phones. The
first reason is the one I most hate, since the time the Esperantists
make me waste I could have used to study Glosa.

I can't see the disk's content today. My PC's monitor burnt and it's
being fixed. The laptop's diskette unit doesn't work and its keyboard is
malfuctioning (I had to connect an external keyboard). Well, it seems
that the Esperantists gave me the evil eye, and I'm jinxed. (I am sort
of afraid of seeing the diskette since with my current luck I could see
the last of the virus that struck you...); but as for the leaflet, I'll
translate into Spanish almost inmediatly, and I'll try to pick some
strenght to translate it into Glosa as an exercise, as you said.

In the warning about not translating "Glosa has no grammar", you also
mean the whole paragraph about G. Bernard Shaw? You're quite right about
the "Glosa has no..." statement, it has to be handled with care. Not as
much as maybe discouraging, but as it could be used ditorted by the
fanatic Esperantists of the UEA as something against Glosa. They take
ridiculous pride in their "16 rules", although most of them have nothing
to do with grammar. But since their propaganda is so strong...

But I suppose that "Glosa has no grammar in the popular understandig of
the term..., etc." is actually good, and is to be translated?

This is the leaflet I suppose I will include in a Spanish Glosa website.
I have been using Tripod for my pages (formerly the Venezuelan
Esperantist website), and it gives me 11 Mb. But if you know of
something better and with bigger capacity (just hoping for a better
future!), please tell me.

As for a question about Glosa... in the "Glosa Basic Reference" I found
in Robin's website, in the Glosa terms for "with" appear "sin" and "ko",
and I don't understand it well. Could anybody show me with examples
their use and how Glosa handles the different uses of "with" in English?
Also "homo" and "iso"confuse me a little. A willing (although currently
a little depressed) beginner shall thank you.

Plu amiko saluta,

Daniel.

P. S.: My dad will travel to England (Liverpool mostly, but maybe also
London) in a few days. Does anyone know what he can get me there that is
Glosa-related? In the leaflet the "18 steps to fluency in Euro-Glosa" is
mentioned and I am interested. Does anyone knows how he (my father) can
get it, and if there's something else?

First test had a problem (no Reply-To address). Here's another (hopefully
the last).

*   Thank You Nick,

     Yes, this 2nd test worked.
     I "Redirected" your _change-of-address_ message to Glosalist
subscribers .. using the new address to do so.

     I trust that the transition is smoothe.  I will test the 
        glosalist-help 
info soon.

Best wishes,
  Robin Gaskell
P.S. I include a coloured comic panel to let you see what is possible
through e-mail.  Older systems will not download the Posts if the .JPG file
is too large.    R.G.

In order to test the new address of the list, I profit the occasion to
send this file. It is a translation into Spanish of the text about Glosa
that can be found in Mr. Bowks Auxilingua site. This translation can be
found in
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/9801/lenguas/glosa01.html. The
Spanish translation of the Euro-Glosa pamphlet can be found in
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/9801/lenguas/glosa.html.

[You may want to check what's going on in
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/9801/lenguas/. I wish that
someday the Glosa content may grow]

*   Since the addition of "lists" to the Glosalist e-address, the normal Majordomo functions have not worked - with, or without, the   lists   in there.


    This 'help' request was sent by Gary at Zeta, testing the system after I alerted him to the glitch: he found that the 'who' request was "swallowed up" straight after he typed it.


    I hope Zeta will have it sorted soon.


Saluta,

Hmm, do you feel like it's Hotel California?
Glosa is an auxiliary language with internationally
recognized word-roots from Greek and Latin.

If it's not your cup of tea... well, Robin or someone
can give ya instructions on unsubscribing... but
if not please stay a while... Ed... what do you think
about Glosa, have you downloaded any materials?
Do you need any URL's for reference? there's a little
on the web, and some subscribers might be able
to send you hard copy materials too.

Probably you were eager to see Robin finish correcting
the new-improved Glosa vocabulary list. Unfortunately,
his computer crashed and he lost much valuable time.
It would help Glosa's web dissemination to get the
cleaned-up public-domain vocabulary online.

At one time, I and Paul were into grammar discussions
and so forth, but I eventually became convinced that
Robin had the right idea all along, emphasizing semantics
above grammar. His writings prove that Glosa works well.

I think removing the copyright from the glosa 5000 list would help a bit
too in public dissemination.  That's what turned me a bit off of Glosa.

Yes.

This is like the situation with the Interlingua dictionary;
it should be on the web, yet available in book form,
possibly with additional explanation etc., and those
who buy it know they are helping to support the lang
by supporting its authors.

That was the intent here, to take the 6000+ words, then
*add* value by correcting errors, and reduce it to a useful
"core" vocabulary (the list now on the web is inadequate)
by eliminating the 27 kinds of British trees, for example.

In other words, I don't think the authors' full vocab
was well-worked-out. But they deserve "slack", and support.

*   A good point, Patrick,
    Reckon I will contact the authors, with a report of the negative effect
of their embargo on releasing Glosa 6000 into the Public Domain.

    If we lived in a different time, with a more positive intellectual
climate, then Clark and Ashby would have sold many more dictionaries, and
would not have felt their economic survival threatened by a possible loss
of sales following the Net release of "6000."

    Putting it bluntly, we live in mean times, in which altruists starve.

    I will try again to suggest that all the big companies released their
products, and sevices, for free ... Netscape, Yahoo, etc ... before they
cleaned up bigtime.  But I fear this argument will be rejected, again, by
Glosa Central.

    While "Omissions" and "2.5K Glosa" keep coming up on my screen saver, I
must really go into action, on them, soon.

Saluta,
  Robin

 Qe singU?-

So she can understand the several (different, diverse) political
movements in the world, the young woman reads two newspapers each day,
and also tries reading a book in this time.
Para entender los diversos movimientos políticos en el mundo, la joven
lee dos periódicos cada día, y además prueba leer un libro en este

Writing in his computer, the writer produced two good black (noir)
novels in a year.
Usando su computadora, el escritor produjo dos buenas novelas negras en

I also send with this, a translation (the most of it) of the Glosa Basic
Information I found in the net a while ago. It is only missing some
Glosa expressions, which I shall have ready in a short while. It will be
found at
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/9801/lenguas/glbas.html. Once
it is ready, you may use it as you wish.

You should check Daniel Garrison Brintons "Aims and Traits of a
World-Language", written in 1889. If it wasn't for his preferred (also
mine) word-order (had he not died in 1899), he would have been a devoted
Glosist (well, maybe also he'd liked LsF):

#   Hi Rebekka,

    I am happy to answer your questions, and pipe this post to the Glosalist Mailing List, as well.  I am glad you included Glosa in your project, because it represent one extreme of the spectrum of Planned Languages: it is a language with syntax-based grammar.

    The hardest question to answer is the one about the number of active speakers, mainly because it is embarassingly low.  We have groups in Uganda and people in other parts of Africa, developing fluency with Glosa - and Africa does have a very severe language problem, with each nation having a national lanuage with numerous regional languages.  At most, the Glosa-pe are in the hundreds.

#   Most would be happy with saying Glosa has no morphological grammar.

The authors say that Glosa words do not change for reasons of grammar.

The closest relative in the national languages, is Chinese: the characters do not change to achieve grammar; characters are grouped to form complex concepts; and syntax is the thing that indicates the relationship between the characters.

    In a second post, I will send supplementary material as attachments.  For tense, a small number of particles are placed (in combination for complex tenses) before the "verb" [=substantive word functioning as the verb]; I will send the 'Tense Table'.  In English, there is duplication between particles and inflection, EG  did go = went; will continue to run = will keep running.  Glosa: ~pa ki~; ~fu du kurso~.


>What i did not quite understand from what I've read so far (I came

>across an article on the web, unfortunately lost the URL):

>* is there a way to express the "passive voice" in glosa? how?

#   Actually, this is as close as Glosa gets to structural grammar:-

 ----ACTIVE VOICE-----------   ---------PASSIVE VOICE---------------

 ~U kanis pa morda un andra.~  ~Un andra pa gene ge-morda ex u kanis.~ 

 [the dog did bite the man]    [the man did get got-bit from the dog]

   The dog bit the man.           The man was bitten by the dog.


>* there was a list of roughly 22 verboids, are those the only verbs? >or are they just special in some way? (maybe the core verbs?)

#  Historically, Glosa [1981] by R. Clark & W. Ashby, is a continuation of the work done in developing Interglosa [1943] by Prof. Lancelot Hogben.  The idea of Verboids started with Hogben, who classified words according to function; the Glosa authors, however, attempted to create an 'open-plan' language, by stating that any word could, within reason, function as any part of speech.

   ~An hedo an kurso.~  He enjoys his run.

   ~Un eqis celero kurso.~  The horse runs quickly.

   ~An vide u celero kurso fluvia.~  He sees a quickly-running river.


  In earlier versions of the Glosa dictionary, Verboids and Auxiliary Amplifiers are mentioned, but in later instruction, the authors considered demonstrating these principles, by example, rather than bycrystallising them into grammatical categories.   Basically, the concepts inherent in M.A.K. Halliday's Functional Grammar apply to Glosa. 

EG....|__VERB PHRASE_______|

  .................... /-------------- SUBSTANTIVE VERB 

   ~Na fu tosto lento ki ana u monta.~

       /   |      |     \_  \

  Tense    |    Modifier  \  Auxiliary

 particle  |    <<Adverb>   \

         Amplifier         "verb"


   =We will soon slowly go up the mountain.


  In Glosa there are two main wordgroups: 'function words' - the small number of primitives that are necessary to make the language work; and 'substantives' the names of things, actions and descriptions, which comprise the bulk of the lexicon.


True Verboids - 

do function as "verbs", but often precede a substantive "verb". 

  es -be, being, is(essentially)

  habe - have, has(the property of)

  gene - gets, becomes

  eqa - equals, is(equal to)

  akti - act, acts, does

  ki - goes  

  este - feel, feels

  dice - say, says, speak


Amplifiers -

do not stand alone as verbs, but alter the effect of a "verb"

  pote - can, has the potential to

  posi - possibly, may

  sio - would (if)

  debi - ought(to)

  hedo - happily

  nece - needs to, must

  more - usually, by habit

  spe - hopefully, hope to


Auxiliaries -

modify the "verb" as a post particle - a separate word following the substantive "verb"

  ana - up

  kata - down

  in - into

  ex - from, out of

  apo - away, away from

  proxi - near  


>* How can you express the imperativ?

>

#   When the Emperor demands, we have the "imperative."

   

  ~Dice!~   demands the Emperor.

  ~Dice a mi.~  says the mother to her child.

  ~Place, dice a mi.~  requests the friend.

  ~Qe, tu pote dice a mi?~  asks the enquirer.


> and a general question: how many active glosalists are there >(roughly)?

>

#   These days non-profit making ideas are hard to sell.  Few have the time, or the productive capacity to waste, on looking at a language because of the inherent beauty it may contain.  Altruism is out of date, and, even, the old-fashioned hobbyist is fairly rare, these days.

    Which reminds me, automation is in: soon people will not have to learn foreign languages or an Auxiliary Language; they will simply select the language they need to understand, or speak, on their handy translating computer.

    In reality, the hands-free approach of learning a Common Second Language is practically, and cost-wise, the most feasible way of solving the World Language Problem ... if there was any political wiil to do so.

    And just to add a little more, Glosa is designed to be 'learnt by doing' as children pick up languages, hence the authors did not print a grammar book.  [A GlosaGrammar2 file will be sent to you.]  The language is supposed to be intuitive, as is the cry for English: generally any Glosa sentence can be translated word-for-word into English, BUT the reverse cannot be said to be true.

    Finally, growing out of Hogben's science-based approach, and started in earnest - after Clark visited Hogben - by Clark and Ashby in 1972, Glosa's development has been parallel with that of computers.

The language was designed to work well at a number of levels:-

  . for science reportage and discussion,

  . as a pedestrian written/spoken language,

  . as a pivot language for translation between national languages,

  . as a meaning representation system for Artificial Intelligence 

involving the machine handling of language, and

  . as an enquiry language for human/machine interaction.

Two interesting questions on Glosa:
1) can it be seen as an all-noun language
2) can we think up (long/complex) sentences in Glosa that are ambiguous because of its lack/freedom from grammatical markers

So pleasingly from the three examples above, all-noun holds good.  But it needs more examples and comparision against Esperanto.

There are no all-noun languages, the minimum is to have
one open class of roots and one closed class of particles,
as in Chinese. All languages have ways of deriving verbs
from nouns, etc, but usually each root has a "default"
reasonable part-of-speech. "Eat" is verblike, though obviously
one can force it to be a noun, "let's get some eats".

One can look at the lexicon of Esperanto or Glosa as
"neutral roots", but semantics make this rather a thin pretense.
I think the brain demands an intuitive separation into
verb/action/relation, noun/object/entity, adjective/attribute.
Anyway, research shows that such words are stored in 3 separate
areas of the brain.

Sure! But ambiguity is a necessary property of language.
We need it, and metaphor, just to function at all.
Glosa has enough grammatical markers to *control* ambiguity.

Here's a nice URL on how language really works:
http://www.ling.su.se/staff/hartmut/griceil.htm

And here's something about Glosa's lexicon derivation:

Loglan has made a valiant attempt to collapse those three categories into one, and it's worth looking at.  It essentially has
substantives and particles.  I find that it's conceptually pretty east to regard verb/action/relation and adjective/attribute as
a single category, but that the noun category is harder to include.

Loglan does it this way:  The word 'mrenu' means 'is a man'.  'Mi mrenu' means 'I am a man.  'Le mrenu' means 'that which is a
man,' and hence is the noun form.

*   This marshalling of things, actions and attributes in different parts of the brain is interesting.

    What experimental evidence is there to say using the one 'symbol' for all three causes mental confusion; and, by contrast, what evidence from experimentation shows the advantages of having distinctive symbols for these three representations of the same concept?

    All the aspects of "man" in "mannish" "manliness" "manny" "unmanly", etc, seem to be produceable using the Glosa-type constructions:-

 andr-iso - manlike, reaching to hanhood

 andro-mode  - mannish, mannishly

 un andro qalita  -  manliness

 andro statu  -  manhood

 no-iso andro  -  un-manlike

 komo-andro  -  like a man


This system works better for those who use language intuitively, and is the opposite of the regularised, formulated way of showing relationships and miing qualities and concepts.

   How would we set up hypotheses to test the comparative effectiveness of these different approaches?

Yes, and unexpected, but not controversial anymore.
You can see it clearly in MRI videos.

> What experimental evidence is there to say using the one 'symbol' for all three causes mental confusion; and, by contrast, what evidence from experimentation shows the advantages of having distinctive symbols for these three representations of the same concept?

Each word in the lexicon has a default part-of-speech established
from repeatedly seeing/hearing it in context. So, "has" is usually
verb-like, "context" is more noun-like, and they get stored/remembered
by different parts of the brain. But one can still force a word into
another category, "I will context this has into a very weird sentence".
Is it the same word or a similar homonym? Whatever, it happens.

So I think any confusion can be removed by use of appropriate particles,
like "u" "plu" "du" "fa" etc., and where confusion is impossible
those particles may be safely and pleasantly elided. I have given up
my old desire for part-of-speech marking; though it sure would have
been nice to reserve -e for verbs as per Hogben ........ lost cause!

Let's give Lojban another 5 or 100 years to finish testing Sapir-Whorf.
It is a quite different research project, a very distracting one,
and not a bit useful today on this planet as an auxlang, IMO.

So can we say there are 4 POS?  Things, actions, attributes, and grammatical particles?  I'm curious as to whether anybody has looked deep into Mandarin.  My knowledge of it is rather anecdotal.

Re Loglan, I think just about any project is worth study, because there are bound to be some ideas that can be imported into other projects.  I'm somewhat intrigued by the Loglan notion of spoken punctuation, and the way it handles numbers, not to mention its
'Self-isolating morphemes', and its designation of a particular word-shape, that is, CV(V) for particles.  Now that I look at Glosa, I think I may have a somewhat loglanized version of Glosa in my own Ceqli project.

I wanted to say that, but it has no support from neurological studies yet.
Usually, particles derive from verbs or nouns, then "erode".
Diachronic language studies do support this view.

And adverbs are sort-of half "particles" and half "ablative nouns".
(This is just my wild speculation.)

> 'Self-isolating morphemes', and its designation of a particular word-shape, that is, CV(V) for particles.  Now that I look at Glosa, I think I may have a somewhat loglanized version of Glosa in my own Ceqli project.

I have often wanted to force all particles ("empty words") to 1 syllable,
and all lexical words to 2 syllables, for easy reading/listening recognition
for beginners. Glosa is a little more "naturalistic" and less "schematic"
so can't do that, but your project could enforce such a law.

One could also use tone for part-of-speech, I suppose. But that's
getting pretty far from auxlang-ness and the mandate of heaven.

*    No good.  The people and ideas active, to-day, will definitely be gone in a century.  With technology and Linguistic theory changing rapidly, I feel that the hypotheses researched, now, will be replaced by quite different ones, soon.

     I'd say that we ought to neaten up the present, by coming to a few working conclusions, now; and, this will tidy up what has happened in the past, making space for new ideas to come through, in the future.

*   I do appreciate Aaron's serious attempts to see if people can misread and misuse Glosa's Syntax-based Grammar.

    But, at the start, I would try to give short answers to the questions he poses:-

  Re Q 1), I guess we have to misread the info that Glosa is an "all-word" or "all-concept" language, to arrive at the "all-noun" idea.

    ''In Glosa each word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.''

Guess I'd have to specify that this mainly applies to the majority 'substantive' word-group, while the 'function words' have fairly agreed usages.  However, this latter group can, for poetry and for communicative effect, be used for any suitable function.


  Re Q 2), this is tricky, and I'm sure we can write gobbldegook in Glosa; but, seriously, I have seen long confusing sentences in beginner's Glosa, so this 'ambiguity from a freedom of grammatical markers' is a very real danger.  Whether the inculcation of the Rules of Syntax 'cures' this problem, or whether

some people are immune to the Rules of Syntax, remains to be seen.

    With a will to do so, we can use sloppy syntax, in Glosa, and this can be more devastating to meaning, than trying to write correspondingly sloppily in English.  So, Glosa might end up a minority sport .. restricted to those 

with a feel for language, rather than to those with academic linguistic knowlege.  However, thoughts keep drifting back to the sixth of humanity that lives in China: many of these people do actually become literate, writing non-ambiguously, using a language that is similar to Glosa, in being free of 'grammatical markers'.

  Also, the  [dog's last bite]  is more likely to be rendered

            kanis previo morda 

  

and being a Noun Phrase, the  [ ... bite]  would make  [(of) the man]  a dependent Noun Phrase, the whole comprising the Subject of a sentence that still needed a Verb and an Object.

   So, your 'average' person, running  [the dog's past bite of the man]  through his brain, would say, "Wait there, the rest of this sentence is missing; perhaps I should read it, again, taking the more obvious meaning."

  

 Perhaps William of Occam, who said that we should always start by assuming the most obvious meaning first, could be our guide.  Is it possible to say that "Occams Razor" applies to a language .. such as Glosa?


>> ~Un andra pa gene ge-morda ex u kanis.~

>

>The man's past-received-received-bite @:from the dog

>

*  OR  "The man's previously getting bitten by the dog ... "

 But this ends up being another Subject Only, part sentence!


~Un andra previo gene ge-morda ex u kanis, pa kausa an te habe mega ma kura

  kron ki-in u-la domi, durante plu seqe visita.~


  {Editor's Note: I would too.}


>> ~An hedo an kurso.~ He enjoys his run.

>

>His happiness @ his run(ning).

>

*  An assumption of the elided "at", again: still out of order! 

   

Exercise: All of the following Glosa sentences are legitimate. 

  a.  An hedo kurso.

  b.  An du hedo an kurso, kron an pa noku an tarsus.

  c.  An habe hedo, e kurso. 

  d.  An hedo kurso longo u fluvia; qi flu ad u mari.

  e.  An du hedo kurso.

  f.  An pa ki ad u parka, te hedo u kurso.

  g.  Hedo an kurso ma de usu, an pa kontinu pro bi pluso cirkula.

  h.  An hedo de kurso.

  i.  An hedo de kurso pa kausa an te praxi singu di.

  j.  An hedo kurso ad u boteka. *  (Two renditions in English: still amounts to substantially the same meaning in Glosa)

 

1. What does each one mean?  (IE translate into English.)

2. Underline the function of each Glosa substantive word: red for "verbs" and "verb auxiliaries", green for "nouns", and blue for modifiers ("adjectives" and "adverbs").  Treat "gerunds" as "nouns".

3. Write three aditional Glosa sentences - with substantially different meaning from any of the above - including the ~hedo~ and ~kurso~ concepts.

4. (Optional) Underline the functions of ~hedo~ and ~kurso~, as above,

in the additional sentences. 

>So pleasingly from the three examples above, all-noun holds good.  But it needs more examples and comparision against Esperanto.

*   I feel that this is a case of 'over-theorizing'; further, I would IMHO differ from you, on your conclusion.

    But, please give Glosa/Esperanto/English, three-line renditions if you think such examples will prove to be beneficial.

{crossposted reply to Glosalist and Rebekka Münger}

    First, I will say that Robin Gaskell's response represents his
understanding of Glosa.  Other people may understand some things
differently.  The principle authors of Glosa, Ronald Clark and Wendy
Ashby of England, do not participate in Internet fora.

On Fri, 15 Oct 1999, Robin Gaskell wrote on Glosalist in 
reply to Rebekka Münger, excerpted here and there and reformatted
because of lack of word wrap:

    This use of "substantive" in this context may not be typical of the
standard use of grammatical terms in English.

    There has been some discussion about an appropriate form for the
passive voice in Glosa.  Robin here tends to use a form more closely
mapping British-family dialects of English.  Those mapping an American
dialect of English would probably use the form "un andra ES ge-morda ex
kanis" ("u" is superfluous, although not strictly speaking wrong, as a
substantive marker after a preposition, which must be followed by a
substantive).  Please note that British-style and American speakers of
English do not use the verb "get" in quite the same way, which may
account for the difference.

    The correct spelling is "Interglossa."  (This was a typographical

    This is Robin Gaskell's personal opinion which is not universally
shared.

    Even as a native speak of (American) English, I do not understand
what this sentence is supposed to mean.

    What Zeta did was to switch the software: somehow I missed the first notice.

    We are now operating under Ezmlm, and not Majordomo, though I still do not know the advantage from the change.


    This new software does just about everything using the address-line: Subjects and messages are ignored by the software. so to subscribe, all you have to do iis to send a blank message to the address:-

     To: glosalist-subscribe{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au


    I would like to place an "info" file, and have made it up, but can't work out how to send it in to the right place, yet.


    We could have fun making up items for a FAQ file, when I find out how to puut the file in Place:-

     To: glosalist-faq{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au


    Also we could fin out who is subscribed, if we find out the syntax for the Questio ... possibly

     To: glosalist-who{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au 


    If anyone has experience of Ezmlm, would you please share it.


    The skeleton of the Ezmlm system is laid bare if you send:

Ceqli is at
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/7429/

Unfortunately, I've been unable to update it for some time.  When Geocities
merged
with Yahoo, my password stopped working, and I've been unable to pry out of
them
exactly how to access the file manager.

Consequently, the website reflects the condition of Ceqli as of a year or so
ago.

    Is there a ''Language of Thought?''

    If there is, can it be known to man?

    For reasons of adverse responses, like yours, I seldom mention this concept nowadays.  However, no argument has been put forward sufficient to dissuade me from it.

*   I will agree, "natural" is a dangerous word to use in discussions about languages.  It is almost as meaningful, for linguistic purposes as the concept of culture.  I wonder in what century people will be able to discus the derivation of national languages dispassionately, maybe never.

    Watch it mate.  with such discussion of linguistic drift, you are in serious danger of saying that "languages evolve."  Although I, myself, tend to be Darwinian about the etiology of language, the idea of 'survival of the fittest words and grammatical structures' can lead to bad feeling, especially from those whose national languages are proving not to "fit" modern communication technologies.

    It would seem that you observe the 'drift' in Italian and English to be on different streams.

    For us, here, the relevant question is about the most suitable "evolutionary" factors to incorporate in a Planned Language: what is the "survival" value of the linguistic elements that were chosen by the authors of Glosa, to incorporate into their language?

*      Actually, years ago, when sailing to England from Australia on the "Castel Felice" I was introduced to the study of Italian: its regularity and direct syntax suggested that it was the ^dodgem car^ of national languages.  It seemed very easy to use.  Sadly, after the ship left Naples, Italian lessons stopped, and I didn't persevere, alone.

*   Certainly, there are many lessons for Interlinguists, from your observations, here.

    The range of linguistic ability is quite wide; also, different people prefer different modes of learning languages.  As regards the method of teaching an auxiliary language, one size does not fit all.

    My own story is that my brother is the one who picks up languages easily, and I, although I like language, am the one who does not.  Anthony learnt Low German in Australia from German migrants, and, while visiting Austria, and talking with friends in a restaurant, was accused by an Austrian, of being a Nazi. After the mistake was explained, the accuser apologised profusely.

    Anthony is also quite fluent in Esperanto, while I, for educational and linguistic reasons, prefer Glosa.  Is either of us _right_, will time tell?

*   This is a timely warning for interlinguists.  

    When, or if, a/the IAL is adopted, there will be a lot of forced volunteers, and many initially unwilling conscripts.  Imagine how you might make language learning palatable to around half of the planet's population!?

    This is a taskof mammoth proportions little touched on the Auxlang List, which seems bogged down oin endlessly discussing the comparative values of the various competing schemes.

*   I am glad to hear that you can read Glosa, but a bit surprised with your uncertainty as to meaning: I suspect that the 'fault' lays with the construction of the language, or with the writer.  Glosa was certinly created with the intention that it be readily accessible, and unambiguous to the reader.  

    Whether such an intention can be realised, and whether Glosa's linguistic configuration allows it to be realisable through Glosa, are still two open questions.


    I don't know if they will help, I have three thoughts regarding writing:-

      % courage

      % fluency

      % thinking in Glosa.

    Unfortunately, in he situation of learning a language the "error" side of learning by _trial and error_ cannot be avoided.  Simply, the more you try, the more you learn, recognising 'errors', and eliminating them, as you go.


    Write a sentence in Glosa.  Say it out loud: does it sound pleasant; and can you follow your original meaning as you hear your words read out?  If the answer to both of these quuestions is "yes," then chances are that others will get the same responses.  If it looks reasonable, on paper, but doesn't pass the ear test, when read out, then RECAST the whole sentence: start again, from scratch; don't try to patch up the 'failed' sentence.

    If what you have written down looks unpleasant, and doesn't even return your original meaning, when sight-read, scrap it, and start again.

    Actually, Glosa, as a language, has a life of its own.  The bits all fit together to form a comprehensive whole, but the learner needs to use some intuition to realise the living language, for himself.  And where no existing mechanism seems to exist .. to allow the expression of a particular thought ..

sometimes innovation is called for.  Perhaps I can say that all present users of Glosa are part of the ongoing experimental process.  We are all part of the research!

*   No, it shouldn't, but yes, it will.  This classic, fault-filled example comprises a concept, a metaphor and a simile.  Ron Clark originally said that metaphors should be avoided in Glosa: I tend to agree, but know they can't, and believe we should find a way to mark intentional metphors and idioms.

  EG  ~Id du pluvi ^plu felis e kanis^.~  This is internationally recognisable, when people realise - from noting the carats (^ .... ^) - that the 'cats' and 'dogs' are introduced from a national culture; and, so, they will guess that the rain is fairly hard.

  EG  ~Bali id a mi.~  This actually says "Throw it to me," but could mean "Send it to me."  At this level, the metaphor is more or less unconscious, built into the language, and virtually unavoidable.  ~Mito~ could be a better choice for "send", but it is still a metaphor, with the 'mit' coming from "hand".  Technology has come a long way since the language was formed, and we can 'send' messages, now, much further than we can pass them by 'hand', or even 'throw' them.  Personnaly, I "blip" messages around the world, via the Net, and feel this is a much more suitable word to describe e-communication .. onomatopoeia rather than metaphor.

    Meanwhile, back to your example, the "No" case is backed up by Glosa's built-in semantic checks. 

   . SIMI  -  similar to

   . HOMO  -  like(to introduce similes)

   . ISO  -  equal to, as

  By discovering the different flavours of these appositional terms, we can differentiate between the types of relationships, by using the appropriate word.

  If we were dealing with insects called "time flies" we would probably describe them as ~plu tem-peti~, deftly using the hyphen to indicate a relationship between the words .. and, of course, the Determinant to indicate the presence of a "noun."

  If the small insects enjoyed arrows - probaly due to the congealed blood on their tips - we would be inclined to use ~hedo~ for the "verb" happily thinking that homonyms are frowned on, in Glosa, and virtually eliminated.

  Were the abstract concept 'time' our Subject, and we mused on its arrowlike passing, we would avoid any danger inherent in using a metaphor, and would 'naturally' use ~pasa~ as our "verb." 

  If, however, we were running a biological experiment, and the flies, that we were timing, moved very quickly, then our observation might necessarily be accordingly swift.  We would be scientifically likely to express this requiired speed of observation as ~ko rapidi~ rather than the inappropriately poetic ~iso 

u sagita~.

  On the other hand, this fly-timimg experiment might seek a significant difference between the performance of the different types of flies, and we were directed to time only those flies that looked like arrows.  In this case, Glosa has a trick with Adjectival Clauses, that would avoid ambiguity: the sloppy "like a fly" would be un-elided (if I can say that) and given its full status as an Adjectival Clause, ~; qi es simi sagita~ ; alternatively the semi-elided Glosa form of the Adjectival Clause might be used, ~; simi sagita~ , noting that while the 'QI ES' is omitted, the punctuation, ';', is not.


  IE  ~Gene u tem-metri pro plu peti; simi sagita.~

       [get a time measure for the flies, (which are) similar to arrow]

        "Time the flies, similar to arrows."

What is known to man or machine is a sort of ontology,
where semantic meanings are associated with each other.
When we parse language, we don't parse it into another language!
but rather into a parse tree. Part of the "tree" persists
in the ontology. We can go hours without thinking a word,
as when engrossed in music or visuals or even sports ...

English definitely goes its own way.

There never was an Italian, it is many dialects semi-united,
or fictionally united. English is very unified, despite
minor divergences in pronunciation of vowels and R.

Of course they do. Linguists are sensitive to negative value judgements,
and with excellent good reason. Nonetheless ...

The thing to focus on, which can never insult *anyone*, is that
the Great Natural Languages are learned culturally by children,
and all can be considered "equal", as their cultures must be;

BUT a planned language is a second language for adults, deliberately
designed to be international and intercultural, neutral, pan-human;
and it must be maximally easy to learn, so that most adults *can*
learn it within a short time without pain and misery!

So let's be mercilessly Darwinian and value-judgmental,
about *planned* *auxiliary* *second* languages, only.
This distinction, planned vs. natural, should be on every page.

> When, or if, a/the IAL is adopted, there will be a lot of forced volunteers, and many initially unwilling conscripts. Imagine how you might make language learning palatable to around half of the planet's population!?

Let's do it in 2 stages, first the willing, then the recalcitrant.
Glosa should aim for at-sight-comprehensibility like the other
naturalistic euroclones. Then it can be used by the few with the many.
I have done so using Occidental with speakers of natural eurolangs,
mixing it in, and happily sloppily pidginizing. It works.

Once you have 10 million users worldwide, the second stage begins,
and it is taught in schools, etc etc. No planned language is there yet.
It is a race to see which will reach that stage-1-finish-line first.

> This is a taskof mammoth proportions little touched on the Auxlang List, which seems bogged down oin endlessly discussing the comparative values of the various competing schemes.

Auxlang is a place to tear down everyone else's efforts,
and become convinced that nothing works or can work, and that
people are too nasty to want to communicate with anyway.

Or with the learning materials. I have to ask whether the difficulty is
syntactic (which I severly doubt) or semantic (can't find the word intended).
I have thought about and tried, but not succeeded with, organizing vocabulary
in a way that can be searched rapidly enough to facilitate writing. I do have
a solution for reading, and I will ask that the list members give some feedback:

Esperanto is impossible, I'm very sorry but ... Ido is much more
plausible. Glosa better still. I have found Occidental superior
to Glosa even, but am not sure why. We have to start looking for
internationality in Europe, and a pseudo-Latin case system with
Polish spelling is *not* a serious possibility.

People can and should and do avoid such jokes when they are not joking.
There is an excellent paper on the web, required reading for auxlangers:

> * Ron Clark originally said that metaphors should be avoided in Glosa: I tend to agree, but know they can't, and believe we should find a way to mark intentional metphors and idioms.

They mark themselves, good ones by their comprehensibility,
bad ones by their ambiguity. If you mar it grammatically,
it is no longer a metaphor, by definition. Let people talk,
and those who want to be understood will "take care" to be clear.

You said it, it made sense, and it solved the problem. The word "like"
is notorious as perhaps the most ambiguous word in English.

I have said before that people need to connect themselves to the
World Wide Web. And they must stop complaining that they "can't" run
CGI scripts lie mine above, or "can't" get a browser with Java (for applets!),
or "can't" stay connected long enough to use Telnet to get into low-bandwidth
virtual reality. We *can* make a virtual Glosaland if you want to,
in one of several different ways. But email is NOT sufficient.

*   This is the message I sent on 29th October; possibly I sent it to the
wrong address, resulting in Alberto not receiving it.  There is the
possibility that his messages to me and to the List are coming through, but
messages from me or the List are not getting to him.
    Must admit, being limited to one body is a bit of a bind, though. I'm
waiting 'til cloning is safe, then I'll have, say, another four of me
churned out.  That ought to be enough to allow me to do all of the things I
want to do.
    
    I still have the transposed time sensation, that writing to people in
an amateur language is more of a pre-WW2 fashion; while, with the MAI, WTO
and all that, the present climate seems very anti-altruistic, and very
confrontational, especially with the excessive concentration of wealth
which is occuring.

However, I will try, even harder, to be more friendly,

*   I read the reference, F.A.Q. to Stephen Pinker's "The Language Instinct" put over in another of your posts, and started referring, again to Pinker's book.

Reference:

http://www.clark.net/pub/ogas/evolution/BOOK_FAQ_language_instinct.html


    The particular level of thought organisation I imply when saying "Language of thought" is captured in Pinker's broad concept, 'Mentalese.'

    Pinker, while acknowledging that we do not always put our mental experience

into speakable words, does suggest that, when it is our intention to make a meaningful utterance, we do seem to assemble various groupings of symbols/concepts/memories at the unconscious level, and organise them into "fuzzy" collections of thought (or pre-utterance) so that they can readily be projected outside our bodies using the spoken/written language we have been taught (or choose to use for that particular utterance).


    I quote:-


 Is language  No.  ...... 

 the same as    Pinker suggests that the language of thought is "mentalese,"

  thought?    then reframes the question as to whether mentalese is the

              same as language.  He points out that we could never learn

              language in the first place unless we first had some

              pre-existing "mentalese" to translate into language.

                Pinker knocks the infamous Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic

              determinism  .....

                Pinker turns to contemporary cognitive science's "physical

              symbol system hypothesis" that all thinking must be the

              manipulation of representations by a processor to frame the

              evidence supporting the claim that English cannot be the

              language of thought.


    So, English is not 'the language of thought', but I toy with the idea: might one of the spoken languages approximate more closely to this "physical symbol system" than does any other spoken language?

    If the "manipulation of representations" can be related, in any way, to the production of spoken language, then I imagine that Glosa *manipulates* its *representations* in a way that is fairly parallel to the way "mentalese" marshalls the concepts we intend to project into speech.

         

    Needless to say, if such parallelism between pre-speech thought and produced language is possible, then it might not, indeed, be an altogether good thing.  Also, it might point to Glosa's outstanding lack of success in the real world.  

    In my time with Glosa, I have become aware that it is NOT ^soft around the edges^ nor does it allow the usual ^encrustation with soft, warm humanisms^

which abound in the natural languages and in many of the Planned ones, as well.

    So, the Glosa authors did intend to strip the flim and flam from the pedestrian use of language to produce a streamlined, precise (and honest) language for no-nonsense, spoken/written communication: it is possible that they succeeded too well with this objective, and produced a language that 'got inside' the mind of the speaker so well, that it left insufficient scope for the human desire to monitor, mediate, and 'diguise' their intention, prior to projecting thoughts as speech. 


    My bottom line is that thought and speech are distant, and distinct, and probably necessarily so.  Very few humans could cope with the situation where their thoughts automatically displayed themselves through speech: people would feel mentally naked; and Freudian slips would occur in epidemic proportions.


    Thus, I feel we have discovered an extension to Gaskell's Theory of Time:

not only do we need sufficient time, in the reception of spoken language, to allow the mechanisms of perception to keep ahead of the utterance flow; but also, we need sufficient complexity and chunkiness, in the language production process, to allow the speaker to monitor his thoughts well in advance of their utterance as words.


    At one stage, while thinking to myself about Glosa, I came to the conclusion that the authors had wanted to create a language in which communication could be "honest."  Having nurtured this idea for a while, now, I have decided that such a language, in which a spade is really called a "spade," 

is NOT what people want.  The temptation is for me to think that Glosa is ''too

good'' or, perhaps not 'dishonest enough' for the human race.

    No kidding: our leaders use double think, and enforce Political Correctness  

in their daily communications with their citicens; I feel this conclusion, in relation to Glosa, is a realistic one, and not a ^jaundiced view^.

*   I cannot find further reference to the term "ontology" but I guess that you are describing an intellectual system, by which we map out the various relationships between the concepts of things, actions and descriptions .. and then relate these relationships to the words we use to symbolise these concepts.

    I will agree that, when parsing any particular language (for linguistic or computational purposes), we keep within the symbol system of that partcular language.  Though I would add that the idea of an abstract set of symbols to represent meaning - when applied to a "meaning representation system" for computer translation - does get away from an 'analysis' in terms of the source language used, and closer to an approximation of how symbols might be 'manipulated' by the brain .. and, possibly, to an "ontology"(?).


    I suspect that there are two strands of thought here: the 'ontology'  comprising partly of 'parse tree' bits, is an academic construct that allows us to understand, in part, how we construct the fabric of language; alternatively, what is actually going on in the brain, as a largely unknown symbol processing system, can be loosely described as a "language" because it is generally agreed by researchers, that the organisation of thought - prior to the formulation of speech - is fundamentally the same in all humans.

    It is the latter of these ideas that I was referring to, when I imagined Glosa to approximate "the language of thought." 

    My imagined language is much fuzzier than Charles' ontology.

I guess we just disagree about this ... I see a language as
"just" a way of *communicating* thoughts between people.
First comes the thought, then the words.

I suppose there are things that can't be communicated in words
at all; arts, other things. So maybe "thoughts" can't really
be split as cleanly as I'd like to think.

> * Without wishing to presume, Is the "comfortable" language Occidental?

Pure laziness! I found that the basic core vocabulary of Occ, both roots and
derivatives, are already 95% known to me in the latinate portion of English.
That makes it almost unbeatable for people with a european language background.

One could still argue that Glosa is superior for non-europeans, and therefore
"better" as a world auxlang. One might argue that it incorporates fewer of
the stereotypical european thought patterns as well, and therefore is really
"better" for thinking-in, which seems to be your contention.

I'd like to see Glosa, Ido, and Occ all become more popular,
and let the public decide which one(s) were "best". Glosa seems
to need the most help, because there is nobody publicizing it.

I want to give a better answer on AUXLANG, but I haven't yet
been able to analyze it properly ... But I am sure that Glosa
"works" and should not be abandoned. The others, Esperanto
and Interlingua, I would rather see die.

And I would like to think, "improving". A good auxlang improves
communication, reduces misunderstanding, brings people together.
We need to prevent World War III, Depression II, and Ecocide I.

I'd hate to see Eo die, because it's the one I can more or less speak.
I think I'd like to see it slowly reform itself.

I think this is a well-intentioned error.  I see a common auxlang as a
sort of linguistic metric system  a useful and valuable thing, but not
at all likely to improve human understanding.  The Yugoslavs mostly
all speak Serbo-Croatian, and the Swiss don't all speak anything.  There
are factors overwhelmingly more important than language.  And for
that matter, would mutual understanding lead to peace or to conflict?

I see your point, and often wonder about it. Despite such exceptions,
I think the tendency is still there: better to argue than not to talk.
But, since I'm both off-topic and unsure, I will drop that subject.

Anyway, I haven't noticed that I think any differently when using
(however well or badly) a language other than English. Others
have said they do, to which I still say hmmm.

   So, in essence, the answer to my question is: "Yes, There is a preferred
order in Verb Phrases, in Italian; and, as in English, the adverb follows
the verb.

*  In line with the above analysis, I append a codification of syntax:-
>(PB) but also the following variations are admissible:

    Meanwhile, in all of your above examples of variation, in Italian, the 
Verb[infl.] moiety has also been 'set.'  This might suggest that verb
inflection is the mode for the wide range of usage within Italian-language
sentences.

*   Spot on.  This is the answer I was seeking.  Thank you.
    It would seem that having a Tense particle separate from the Verb-
Infinitive, in Italian, is not a major usage.
    In only two of the first eight versions, did the Adverb precede the
Verb, suggesting that this structure is a minority one, in Italian;
similarly, only in versions Eight and Nine, did the "particlisation" of
Tense come up.
    What is especially interesting, from the Glosa point of view, is that
the Ninth, and final, version is the one that 'maps onto' Glosa's syntactic
pattern.
  It.   "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via"
  Gl.   ~An pa hedo kurso longo u via.~
  Eng.  "He did happily run along the road."
           \_T.__Mod.__V._/
              Verb Phrase

    My first guess is that Glosa sentence formation will be harder for
Italians than for English speakers; because, as well as both languages
having mixed syntactic forms, each with the tendency to place the Verb
before the Adverb, 
Italian-language also is more inflected than English.

*   So, this location, in Italian, of Modifiers (Adverbs and Adjectives)
after the words they modify is the opposite to that of Glosa.  What sort of
confusion, for the average Italian learner of languages, will it cause, to
ask him/her to learn Glosa?

*   Yes, the special case of the "Orso bruno" does point to one of the
severe problems with trying to form an 'International language'.  Without
solving the problem, I will sidestep it, by looking, again, to see three
brown dogs.
    The crux of the matter was the idea of having a set rule of syntax in
Glosa.  I am curious to know how hard it will be for someone who "thinks in
Italian" to also learn to "think in Glosa."
    Which reminds me: is the "veloci", which relates to the ~celero~,
modifying the "run" or the "bears"?  According to Glosa's rules of syntax,
~celero~ precedes the substantive "noun", ~ursus~, and so Modifies it
(=Adjective, in Eng.): we end up with "fast bears." 
   
   To quickly finish this part of the story, I would like to explain what
"Head Final" phrase structure means in Glosa.
   "Head final" is a decription of a phrase in which the major concept-word
is the last word in the phrase, with all of the specifying, colouring and
modifying words coming before it.

  Un alti melano-ge-kapila, no-intelige andro fu posi tosto celero kurso.
  [the tall black-haired un-intelligent man will possibly soon quickly run]

What have I tried to do?
~andro~ is the "noun" and is always the final word of the NOUN PHRASE. 
~kurso~ is the "verb" and is always the final word of the VERB PHRASE.

~U(n)~ is the determinant, indicating the next Substantive word will
function s a Noun.
~fu~ is the Tense Particle, indicating the next Substantive word will
function as a Verb.

~alti~ is a Numerator (of size), and has low semantic value, so is next in
importance after the Determinant.
~posi~ is a Verboid - adding only a little information to the operation of
the "verb", and is second in importance to Tense.

~melano-ge-kapila~ is a descriptive modifier adding a bit more info to our
picture of the man, so is closer the the "noun" than the Numerator, ~alti~.
~tosto~ another Verboid, adds some urgency to the story, and so is closer
to the "verb" than the less specific Verboid, ~posi~.

~no-intelige~ is a high-level Modifier; and, of the Modifiers, adds most to
our _understanding_ of the man, so goes closest to the "noun" ~andro~.
~celero~, of the Verb Modifiers, gives us most information of _how_ the man
will run, and so goes closest to the "verb", ~kurso~.

Although the Glosa authors never said it, there is a fairly well-defined
order for the placement of Modifiers before both "nouns" amd "verbs".  This
sequence is directly related to the semantic significance of the Modifiers,
having the low-level Modifiers furthest from the Substantive they modify,
and the most meaningful Modifiers just preceding the Substantives they
modify ... with intermediate Modifiers located, in rising significance,
between the least and most significant. 

   Amazingly, in the Functional Grammar used to describe how English works,
Linguists have spelled out that the same situation also applies to
Modifiers preceding English-language nouns; these nouns, also being the
last words in Noun Phrases, qualify the phrases as being "Head final".

Not so.  There's a difference in meaning between 1-7 and 8-9:

1-7 are in 'passato remoto' (remote past, past perfect?) tense
('corse' indicating past perfect, 3rd person singular);

8-9 are in 'trapassato remoto' tense. This tense indicates an action
which is past respect to another past action. 'Aveva' is the imperfect
tense of the auxiliary verb 'essere' (to be), (3rd person, singular),
and 'corso' is the past participle of 'correre', and it is invariant.

Yes, I understand that this cannot be clear from this description.

Yes, but there's a difference in meaning between 1-7 and 8-9. They are
used in different circumstances.

The 'passato remoto' (1-7) is not used much in speech (except in
sicilian), and even in writing is being used less and less, and
nowadays it sounds formal.  I used it to translate the glosa phrase
because it offer a sense of completeness of the action.  Other tenses
requires a context to make sense.

Ok. But the italian here means rather: He had happily...

BTW, in tense-table there's the following example:

       An pra vide                He had seen
       An pra-du vide             He had been seeing

The word 'pra' however is not defined anywhere else.  Is this a
misspelling for 'pre'?


Now, the meaning of "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via" should
be something like:

An pre pa hedo kurso longo u via.


or:  past      t2    t1                    now                     future
      <--------+-----+----------------------+------------------------>

Phrase 9 refers to someone which at time t1 had runned at time t2.

I don't think that word order is a problem. Lack of inflections may be.

Apart:

The following is an excerpt from an Internet Oracle response that I
read recently. It is intended to be humorous, but nevertheless shows
the kind of confusion that arises frequently in english:

# The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
# Your question was:
# 
# > Benevolent in temperament is the Oracle,
# >
# > Why are there still trees?
# 
# And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
# 
# } There aren't.  What a ridiculous question.  Everybody knows stills
# } don't grow on trees.  They mutate from abandoned car radiators.
# }
# } Oh, wait, my apologies.  You meant why are the trees not moving around.
# } What a silly language this is.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Now you understand why people is suspicious when a conlang is too
similar to english?   8-)

I don't think that the order of words is a problem, at least if nouns,
verbs, adjectives etc. can be easily recognized.  But IMHO the
difficulty is that non inflected languages are harder to parse, since
they offer less hints. On the other hand, they may be easier to learn.

The bears.

In italian 'veloci' is an adjective (and the ending -i indicates
plural, so it aids the parsing), and so it modifies the noun.  The
corresponding adverb is 'velocemente':

"I tre orsi bruni corsero velocemente nel parco."     
"Velocemente i tre orsi bruni corsero nel parco."     
"I tre orsi bruni corsero nel parco velocemente."     
"I tre orsi bruni velocemente corsero nel parco."     

(here velocemente modifies the verb)

BTW, 'tosto' is also an italian word (old fashioned, but
comprehensible).

IMO, if that a common language exists, it is way lower level than the
natural languages we speak consciously.  

In my to do list there is also the task of reading something about
this topic.

I did not mean to imply that modern italian is better than old

Maybe that languages like Glosa will be more universally

Do you mean schools which teach English as a foreign language, or
schools for native speakers?

Most of the native English speakers have an abysmal knowledge of their
language.  Look at the following message, recently posted in
soc.culture.esperanto:

Hello-

First off, I'd like to apologize for using English.

I'm a student at the University of Illinois. I am writing a paper for my
linguistic history class about how Esperanto has changed over time since
its creation. 

[...]

Are their usages that have changed over the years? Become obsolete? Are
their new phrases popping up?
----------------

This guy is an universitary level student in some field which regards
linguistic, and still he doesn't know the difference between 'there'
and 'their'.  How many americans do know their language grammar? maybe
the top 1%?

I even found serious misspellings in books published by prestigious
publishers. (Typical is 'principle' for 'principal')

As far as I know, English is the only language in which this happens
regularly.

But we were talking about auxlangs, and I ended up bashing English.  8-)

IMHO, yes.  The more grammar there is, the better.   8-)

Seriously. Grammar, if free of the historical incrustations that
natural grammars usually have, is an help, not an impediment, IMHO.

Maybe you mostly liked the easy pronunciation rules?

How long does it takes a travel by ship from Australia to England?

All of the proposed IAL I have seen so far seem very easy to learn,
but, of course, you cannot force people to learn a language.

If an auxlang becomes widespread, the people will *want* to learn it.

Why do you think people around the world learn english?  Because of
the beauty of this language? (NO!)

In my case, I wanted to peruse the scientific literature which is only
available in English. (BTW, I only know English as a written
language. I can't speak it except for a few very basic words, and
certainly I don't understand a word of spoken english).

Well, yes, but nevertheless something I have learned from this list.

Often the double meaning of a sentence is not evident to the
writer. If I see in my writing a phrase that can be read in different
ways, I try to disambiguate it. But If I don't realize that a phrase
can be read in a way different from what I had in mind, I cannot do
anything to clarify.

Another example of confusion (the example is from an article on
Interlingua on the web):

  'The International Auxiliary Language Society'

What's international the language or the society?

This is not a contrived example, I have found real cases like this one
in which I don't understand the meaning.

In Glosa I guess this could be resolved by using hypens to join
related words, but what if the writer does not realize that the phrase
is ambiguous (after all, he *knows* what's international)?

In English, one could call his society:

    'The International Society for Auxiliary Languages'  or
    'The Society for the International Auxiliary Language'

but usually won't.

You bet.

I think it's just a question of efficiency.  It's true that kids
learns perfectly their native language even without a written grammar,
but it takes them 10 years or more.

Saluta!

Hm...

Pity your word list doesn't allow one to say, "The silence is eerie."

That sentence came to mind, somehow.

Kindly translate:

"She went to the shop to shop for a dress and other things and when
she returned shop worn in the dress worn once found she had left
the other shopping in the shop."

Daniel, I didn't expect to find you here.  Take care of yourself, man.
Just possibly, you are working too hard.  Just possibly, simultaneous
involvement with every language on earth is not something you can do
without affecting your health.  You probably have better things to do.

In short, in the friendliest possible way:  Get a life!

with such amount of spare time. Well, now I guess Glosa could get some =
of it! (TV is quite a demanding lover).

Mi fu akti so!

Robin and Charles' thread has been must fun! I had been working of the =
language/thought(/and culture) subject for my dull "Introduction to =
Anthropology" class, and even used Glosa as an example for discussing =
"the variations of the structural aspects of language". (Aced the damned =
thing!)

No tv, and books were just to be borrowed from libraries.
That's the way to live free ... ah, but no cats then.)

I suggest you give 20 minutes minimum to Glosa study every day.
It's like exercise, necessary to avoid degeneration ...
what a happy thought, not! And study a different aspect each day.

I have found some confirmation for my observation that reading at slow speed
is necessary at first, until some of the common words become automatic.

Maybe there's something to Robin's "clarity of thought" argument,
more than meets the eye. Or else Glosa attracts the brightest people?

**   Yes, in English - and I hope Glosa - there are about three psts:-

 Time .....x...........x.............xxxxxxxxxxxxxx(NOW)..... Line

 ---- Way before -- Did happen ---- Did start in the

 - something else - and is now ----- past and is now

 -- in the past ---- completed ------- continuing


Eng.  "had"(Perfect)  "has;did"   ___  "have;has done"


Glo.  ~pra~  "   "  ___ ~pa~  ________  ~pa;du pa~ 


  The question of the Old Glosa ~pra~, which was current at the time I posted the Tense Table, but has since been withdrawn by the authors, 

is a tricky one.  I suspect that ones decision depends on ones position on the _conformist---pragmatist_ spectrum.  While I TRY to fit in with everything the Glosa authors say, I have to remember, that, like me, they are mortal; and, that, out there, there is the world of humanity, which will change language to suit its needs, generation after generation anyway!

  The above is a 'bare-bones', non-exhaustive precis of the position of both Glosa and English in relation to pastness.

  For me, personally, the facility to express the "deep past" is a part of my psyche; and, so, I refuse(?) the advice of Paul Bartlett, to drop the archaic Glosan term ~pra~, which, I feel, has 'functional life.'

*   English has similar archaisms: Glosa is not supposed to.  However, when translating a natlang archaism into Glosa, we would probably find a way of conveying the 'old world' flavour.  Both English and Italian have found specialised usages to convey unusual time and semantic relationships.

*   Caught by the old Perfect Past, again; thus, none of the examples you gave, it seems, 'map' directly onto Glosa.

>

>The word 'pra' however is not defined anywhere else.  Is this a

>misspelling for 'pre'?

>

*   This anomoly is explained above.  I retain it for both history and sanity.  Perhaps I have been cowardly, in retaining it in the Tense Table, while not coming straight out, and putting it in the Glosa 6000

ammended list.

  EG Pre na grupa pa gene ad un akro, an pra skendo u monta.

 [before our group did get to the top he had ascend the mountain]   

  Before our group got to the top, he had ascended the mountain.


>Now, the meaning of "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via" should

>be something like:

>

>An pre pa hedo kurso longo u via.

>

* [he before did happily run along the road] *   NOT good Glosa!

   Before, he ran happily along the road.  

 OK in vernacular English, after the syntactic re-arrangement, but the ~pre~ is really an elided preliminary phrase, ~Pre nu,~.


Better either as:-

    An pra hedo kurso longo u via.  

  [he had happily run along the road]

....  Though this form tends to demand the 'closer past' event against which the 'earlier past' one is compared.


or,

    An pa previo hedo ....

  [he did previously happily .... 


or, eliding the ~pa~, 

    An previo hedo kurso .... 

   [he previously happily run ....

   He previously ran happily ....


  If this chap ran along the road twice, once happily, the second time, otherwise, we might want to invoke something "like" the Past Perfect Tense to convey the time differential; and, I would judge Glosa to be a lesser language, if it could not make this discrimination ... through tense.  I vote-with-my-pen to revive the Old Glosa form, PRA. 



>or:  past      t2    t1                    now                     future

Saluta,

  Robin Gaskell


***e nu uti england-lingua:-

Dear Friends,

  Here I publish the information that I have just renovated my Web-page.

Several new pages have been added, but there is little change to the existing pages.


  Things are very diferent from the time I first located pages on the Web.  Now, I used the program, "AceFTP", from the front of a magazine, to locate my files in the memory of my ISP's computer.  The thing that caused me most difficulty was in giving my correct information for my connection.

  Before sending the completed pages to the ISP, I could move around the Web-pages, located on a disk - using "Explorer 4".


  Best wishes for the New Year, and the New Millenium.

  Because of the possibility of Y2K viruses, I will not use the Internet before 4Jan2000.


  And because of actiivity concening Seattle, I have not sent messages to this List.  All of the WTO and NWO situation worries me, and I believe there is no adoption of a language, that is suitable for all of mankind, before we again have Democracy around the world.


  To-night I work on a train to Newcastle in NSW, and a few minutes before the year 2000, I arrive in that city.  There, I will see their celebrations, and when I leave Newcastle, at 1:47 a.m., I will carry many of the celebrators to their homes.


  I must dress as a train guard before work.  So, ask about the fortunes of Glosa in the new millenium.  It is a beautiful language, but nobody needs it.  Will mankind need a world language in the near future?

    Robin's post reminds me that I really would like someone
else to take over the Glosa WWW pages I have hosted for quite
some time now.  It might be a shame if it comes to the point
at which I simply remove them without notice in order the
reclaim the space.

Ooooh, don't do that! Maybe I could give them a home. How much
diskspace do they require? Looks like the biggest chunk is the
reference, eh?

Hi Paul,
Here's a message from a couple of months ago
where I announced the new pages where your 
files can reside if you wish...
http://komunika.intercosmos.com
http://glosa.intercosmos.com
http://glosa2000.intercosmos.com

Robin can have these sites if he wishes
and they are for anyone wishing to publish
materials for Glosa...
