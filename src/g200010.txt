Your meds wore off? Be careful not to drive while
you're in that state. When have you cultists
scheduled the next end of the world, by the way?
Do you expect Interlingua to catch on before then?
Is there any single open IAL list that you have
not destroyed with your tricks?

I found one you pulled in AUXLANG before I joined:
somebody wanted to do a poll of members, so you
found 20 innocent beginners from outside the list,
pushed them to join and vote for the only IAL they
knew about ... your favorite. You can quit trying to
infiltrate the Occ groups with your email aliases.

I feel that there is a lot of interest in Glosa,
much more than for your simulated Romance language.
Hogben passed on his idea to A&C, who improved it.
Now it appears that soon it will again be passed on,
perhaps to a committee to oversee its evolution and
growth. (Is "evolution" another hot spot for you?)
Glosa will survive and revive and grow. The more you
attack and disrupt, the more you inoculate Glosa
against further infections like yourself. (Oh, are
"vaccinations" also a problem for you cultists?)

Still it seems to me that email lists cannot
long remain open to provocateurs like Jay Bowks.
Some of us are talking off-list about the needed
reforms (another word ...) you won't be part of;
your antics are unacceptable in polite company.

Of course the final vowel problem must be solved: 
Glosa is in competition with other auxlangs.  Every unsolved problem 
  is a disadvantage in this competition. 
Differing final vowels are very problematic for a short hand system 
  and for computer translation. 
They are difficult to learn.  And vocabulary learning is hard work. 
  Ask a language teacher ;) ;) ;) ! 


An example to make clear what I mean (I think normally not necessary): 
To memorize the Latin word "via - way", you learn the root vi-, that 
is similar to the English, and the ending -a, which gives the 
beautiful imagination that via is female.  So you have to learn two 
things, both easy.  
For an auxlang only one would be best. 
But in Glosa you have to learn the root and the final vowel, again two 
things, but the final vowel does not give the imagination of a gender 
nor of anything else. 
A vowel on its own is abstract and difficult to memorize, similar to a 
number. 
A systematical chosen final vowel would help this. 

That is the problem and it is a problem.  Sure, we can and should use 
Glosa without taking final vowels too serious (see Wendy's letter), 
but that is only provisional (I hope).

His persistent sniping personal attacks must be stopped.
They prevent others (who have something positive to say)
from participating in the list. He has killed several
IAL lists in this way. He wants Glosa dead too.

> Libe-dice es fo importa ra.

There are limits to free speech. He is trying to shout-down
anyone who "threatens" his lunatic opinions, i.e. he has
trampled *my* free speech rights, and on several email lists.
It won't stop, even after warnings, even after promises
to stop the personal attacks. He can't control himself.

We aren't going to accomplish anything here as long as
he continues to disrupt everything. Open email lists
are easy prey for flaming trolls such as Jay Bowks.
Better to continue serious discussions off-list.

    I am not feeling well this evening :-( so I won't try to respond in
Glosa.

On Mon, 2 Oct 2000, Marcel Springer wrote (excerpt):

    Yes.  When I first collated the wordlists for the Basic Reference
which I put up on the www (with A&C permission), I noticed the final
vowel problem for real: sometimes basically the same word on more than
one list with more than one final vowel, and sometimes two distinct
words differing only by the final vowel.

    I think the first issue can be solved simply by picking one of a
pair (or in at least one instance, one of a triplet) and using it
exclusively.  I myself am not convinced that it makes much difference
which one is chosen.  Of course, there is the position that one might
use the final vowel at least partially as a part of speech marker, in
the manner of Ido, Esperanto, Master, Suma, and many others.  Again, I
myself am not convinced that this is necessary.  If there is
standardization in the first instance, then I think that the second
issue more or less resolves itself.

    Contrary to an opinion that has been expressed here, I do not think
that all final vowels will degenerate into an undifferentiated mush. 
It is true that native English speakers tend to slur unstressed vowels,
but I do think that we can justifiably expect users of an auxiliary
language to expend at least a little effort if they want to be
understood.  I do not think that a constructed auxlang must always bow
to the habits of native English speakers.

[snipped etc]

Well, I retreat halfway from my mush hypothesis; we can certainly
distinguish MANU from MANE, or something like that. But there are
some terrible pairs like BALI BALE which really cannot be distinguished
in an unstressed syllable by *adult* learners internationally.
Those relatively few pairs can easily be fixed, no big deal.

There's still the significant difficulty of learning them, since
they follow no pattern. Best to use the etymologically correct vowel.
Again, a very easy reform that can't offend anyone but a lunatic.

Part-of-speech vowels are tempting, but I abandoned that Idoesque
idea a while back; they aren't sufficient anyway, because there are
more than 6 parts of speech, and many more derivatives than that.
The problem of word-derivation has no easy solution in Glosa,
other than random word-compounding e.g. "XXXX-ABILI".

Why not just go through with your "more serious reform"
give the thing a name and be done with it instead of
continuing this determined effort to force Glosa into
your idea of what it should be?
What are you so afraid of that you keep posting this

As a "linguist", perhaps you can say where the Romance languages
came from ... perhaps it was an act of special creation?

And why are Greek and Latin, the sources for Glosa's roots,
so similar or haven't you noticed?

Do you think that the Indo-European parent language
can be less than 6000 years old?

Please do the math for us, as any linguist would.

Actually Charles, the fact that I'm a religious
fellow is to your advantage. Otherwise I would
answer you in kind. But I'm not in any meds nor
have ever been :-) As to whether you like or dislike
my religion, all I can say is I've a great deal
more tolerance for others than what you show here.
And for you to attack below the belt... well, Jah
sees and may He do something about it. Your bark
is a lot worse than your byte ;-)
As to the Auxlang poll, there were no rules that
one couldn't invite new members to vote. I broke
no rules. I claimed no secrets, everything was on
the up and up. As to my alias... ilvi@ earthling.net
That's been around for a long time and actually
was my first login name it stands for "I love VI"
as a Unix user you should know what that's about.
But in Occidental{at}egroups{dot}com I'm posting under
my regular ISP, you remember the one you lyingly
tried to get me kicked out of. No secrets here
Catty, actually it seems you're the only one with
secrets, what's all this of private conversations...
what are you so afraid of? A little paranoid it
seems to me. If your idea of polite company means
people who think and act like you I'd rather not
be in such hateful and biggotted company. As to
the Glosa list, I've been here long before you.
I've exchanged emails on Glosa with Robin for
a long time before you knew what it was Catty.
I hope Glosa interest grows, I hope Interlingua
interest grows. I even hope English use grows in
the Globe. However unlike you I see no contradiction
in any of those situations.

For me Interlingua serves a different purpose
than either Glosa or English serve. It is a means
of access to Western Vocabulary that is shared
among many nations. Glosa is a means of easy
access to terms that are found in Western languages
and the essence of those communications, it has
a limited vocab because of its design, it has
easily mastered mechanics that make it good enough
to use. English on the other hand is a language
without bounds, it is bouncing freely and it is
a means of access to the international vocabulary
as Glosa is and Interlingua more so because of its
design. But English has the force of commerce
behind it and the spirit of modern technology
keeping it in the forefront of international
communications. I see no conflict amont the three.
Whatever you see through your darkly colored
lenses must be a sad and lonesome sight, I feel
sorry for you mate. St. John's Wort is good for
that they say... ;-)))

To me that sounds like typical teacher's talk.  In spite of all your
hate against your pupils's motivation and their low ability - that is
certainly punished by you with pleasure -, you cannot deny that some
words are easy to memorize and some not, independent of the aptitude
of a single pupil.
Look:
  rosa        - rose
  lepidoptera - butterfly
When you do not see a difference here, all your certificates you are
proud of have no value.  In an auxlang the easier words must be
prefered.  Abstract final vowels must be mnemotechnically handable,
possibly with etymology.


Jay:

Your allegory is nice for natural languages and to protect minority
languages and rare dialects, seems also good for auxlang oldtimers like
Volapük and Esperanto.  But for a constructed language that is under
construction yet it is de-structive.  It blocks development.  I really
like your beautiful websites and I really did not wanted to believe
Charles, that you are destructive, but now I get this feeling by
reading YOUR own mails.

Let me emphasize the positive and con-structive things:
We got a letter from Wendy Ashby, she is Glosa author and THE
authority.  The letter was posted here on 00-09-30, please read.
Now the problems "SILVA/SILVI (forest)" and "ATRIA/ATRIO/ATRIU (hall)"
are solved, namely to silva and atriu.  And we got the information
that the words of the book "Central Glosa" should be prefered to the
ones of the book "Glosa 6000".  That is a lot!
Soon I will send the Similar Synonyms list
(www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ) to her and it seems possible that
the items listed there (over 1000) could be cleared up the same way.
Please try to see that this is a success and a step ahead.

In my mail of 00-09-30 (some did not understand) I just was
disappointed about the focus for the final vowels only set on English.
It should be either classical (Ancient Greek and Latin.  This way is
refused by Wendy's letter explicitly, and perhaps it is really a step
back in language history.) or naturalistic (right word? I mean the
thing with modern languages), but then more languages than only
English must be taken into consideration.

But maybe I misunderstood Wendy here.  The article of "Plu Glosa Nota"
she sent and I will soon post tells about English AND French, German
and Russian.  If so, I would be satisfied.  Again sorry, that I spread
my frustration into this list, though I myself do not like destructive
people.  Penite e poli saluta - Marcel

Jay's gallery of IALs is a morgue. Jay aspires to be the IAL
undertaker/mortician, he likes them dead and harmless.
And please always say "development", Jay chokes on "evolution".

We need to form an authorized Glosa steering committee. Otherwise,
the language dies with its authors to be mummified in Jay's morgue.
(Some say he likes to poison them when they're still alive ...)

It's OK to examine English derivatives to discover the right
etymological vowel, usually. Most -ation words point back
to Latin -a, -ition to -i, and -tion or -ssion to -e.
Similarly for other suffixes, the pattern remains (embalmed)
in English ... Greek is more difficult, but most Glosa words
are Latinate-English.

I would disagree, I don't see this as some race with
several contestants running for the finish. It is
rather like a garden, with all sorts of flowers
blooming, let them all bloom in my opinion, and
enjoy the beauty of each one. May the prettiest
get the commendation, and the one with the best

A computer system could not care less if the

hand system there is always SpeedWords, que no?

Ooooo. youoooo! ;))) I am a language teacher with
14 years of classroom instruction under my belt.
I've been trained by prof. Rassias from Dartmouth,
and consider myself a linguist, certainly the hours
of training and the post-grad credits would certify
me as one. From this I can vouch that it is not the
learning of vocab that is the hard work. Rather it
is the motivation and the drive to accomplish that
is the worst hindrance against learning a foreign
language. As a Multi-lingual speaker I may have
an easier time than mono-lingual learners in
acquiring a foreign language / auxlang. But the
trick is the wanting to do so. And realizing a
need to accomplish it. No need, no drive to do
it and it is definitely not going to succeed.
There may be physical problems that have nothing
to do with attitude, but rather aptitude or ability.
But I'm convinced that given the right training a
lot can be accomplished.

I dunno, I never thought of it in this way... "via" is
"via" to me like "way" is "way" and I don't break it down
into roots and affixes. The word has a meaning that I can
visualize in my mind. And actually both those words,  "via"
and "way" aren't necessarily 100% identical, although one
can translate the other, but in either case the word has
it's own set of associated experiences.

But glosa is a system where this derivational
system is not really actively proposed. It is
somewhat passive. The Mechanics simply show
in what circumstances the vocab might be of
help in expressing thoughts.

I really don't see the problem. To try to
force Glosa into patters that Eo and other
schematics follow would be extreme. In my
opinion, the fact that Glosa is flexible
in this respect is encouraging, it shows
that it can function as many a natural
language does.

I appreciate the freedom to disagree with whomever.
Thi doesn't necessarily mean that I disrespect anyones
opinion though. Let all the pretty flowers bloom I say.

BTW, We had an Oktober Fest at the Colony Mill Marketplace
here in Keene, NH, yesterday. There were 9 other Jehovah's
Witnesses in attendance, pretty much without each of us
knowing about the others coming to the outdoors concert
and tapping of a special keg of Oktober Fest brew, we
had a good time, Alpine horns included. When you run
into people from several congregations in New England
as this was, it makes the world seem like a very tiny
place indeed. And disagreements seem so unimportant.

Whether your grand-daddy was an ape I wouldn't
want to argue the case. Jesus once called the
pharisees "offspring of vipers", so perhaps a
one such might be more your type.

I certainly do believe that the Almighty did
create. How he did so is not my field of study.
I'm very interested in the development of languages
and the human ability to acquire and use language
to communicate with one another. Sometimes there
is a total breakdown of communication, and some-
times its not even worth the spit wasted, such
as in talking with you. Or as in this case, the
bits wasted.

What this hasto do with Glosa, I dunno. Why you
continue to hound me, this I know well and may
you receive the full recompense.

My only regret  is not having followed through
to be peaceable with all men as far as I'm able.
In your case there are certainly some exceptions.
Now was it homo erectus or some other homo you
claim your ancestry from?

Subject: [glosalist] the 6848 Glosa words
From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2000 11:52:52 -0700


The best thing about Ogden's Basic English and Zamenhoff's
Esperanto (Linqvo Internacia) was that a single sheet of paper
could list the entire vocabulary, making it easy both to read
and write. This is only possible if the vocabulary is limited
to around 1000 roots, and a productive system of word
derivation is designed as part of the language.

Glosa's full vocab has generated much dissatisfaction:
inadequate to span the range of words needed for everyday use,
but too large for anybody to memorize or even comfortably study.
No way this can work for people lacking eurolang background.

People who can memorize 6000+ vocabularies can and do learn
French/Spanish/etc instead of any IAL. They amount to 5%
of the population. IALs are for the 95%. Only 2 strategies
can work; fortunately they can be used simultaneously:

1. concentrated 1000-root list
2. naturalistic open/infinite set

Out of the mass of 6543 or so official Glosa words,
there must be 1000 really good general words, suitable
for a solid-practical and easily-learnable basic vocab.
At random I pick LIG- ...

12345   lig     liga            bind, ligature, tether, tie
5       ligatur ligatura        book-binding
4       lign    karbo ligni     charcoal
245     lign    ligni           timber, wood
4       lign    ligni-pe        carpenter
4       lign    tekto ligni     timber
5       ligr    ligro           baneful

That's basically 7 terms, 3 roots (LIGA, LIGNI, LIGRO).
Hmm ... the Occidental Radicarium has only these 2:
"LIGAR = to bind" and "LIGNE = wood". Kennedy's book
"Word Stems" lists the same 2, with these derivatives:
ligament, ligature, alligation, league, oblige;
ligneous, ligniferous, lignite, lignumvitae.
Of course there are infinitely many more. Well,
what do they know? Let's try the Novial Lexike:

ligamente FED, D Gelenkband. 

lige F ligue, E league, D Liga, Bund, Bündnis
| -ga F lier, E bind, attach, D (fest)binden, zusammenbinden
| -gostreke F trait d'union, E hyphen, D Bindestrich. 

ligne F bois (matière), E wood (material), D Holz
| -naje F charpente, E woodwork, D Holzwerk
| -natri. 

Who cares what Otto Jesperson says?? We'll ask Dr. Gode:

liga ligamento ligamentose ligamine ligar ligatura
ligni-cole lignificar lignification ligni-forme
lignina lignite ligno lignose ligure
Liguria ligus- ligustico ligustro

Sorry I asked ... Anyway, it looks like we stumbled onto
a couple of productive internationally known roots here.
If we kept only the 2/7ths of the Glosa words which are
equally productive and international, that would be cool!

Users would still be at a loss for a system (simple pattern)
to help them derive all those derivatives, but such could
EVOLVE through real-LIVE usage.

Not only that, but these international words are recognizable
with very little study, to over 2 billion busy people today.
It would also put the language teachers out of business.

Very droll, rubbish-jay!
At least you have now copied Don Harlow's tactic

But you are still in the slime; you need to evolve.

Tsk. Now you won't capitalize Glosa either.

Occ allows what you now call "tweaking" but everyone
else calls "real-world use and constant evolution".
There are many sub-dialects under Occidental/Interlingue,
all mutually comprehensible and intermixable. I think
Novial might as well be included as a form of Occidental,
since Jesperson and Ahlberg accepted all of De Wahl's
suggestions.

But I'd much prefer to see Glosa grow as intended by
its authors, Hogben and Clark: creole, not crayola.

By now, you are fooling nobody with your act.
I wouldn't have replied to you if you would just
ignore my posts as suggested 2 months ago.
You are attempting to waste my time, I know ...

> So why not make your own project?

Because the world doesn't need any more, *and* because
only someone who knows most of the European languages
is qualified to make one. I know of someone who can,
but he isn't interested, because of the rabid
ankle-biting can't-do auxlangers like Jay Bowks.

You fanatics have made all the IALs appear foolish.

You have no authority. I doubt you have read, and know you

You get a charge out of this. What kind of idiot are you

I have some JW friends, but they aren't so ignorant as you.
Answer the question about the evolution of language,
admit your flat-earth theories. When's the world ending?

You have already pulled this group down into the slime.
Be happy. Now, please stop emailing privately to me.

Rubbish charles! What may kill glosa is the constant tweaking
that you are so fond of... why not tweak Occi which does have
a long history of "evolutionary" development ;-)

So why not make your own project? What are you afraid of? I'll
certainly include it in the Auxilingua Project pages... there
are quite a few alive projects in there... Eo, Interlingua, and
Ido of course... But unlike your dislike for my pages I've had
a lot of positive feedback on them from folks who are interested
in IALs. Yes,  they are a bit due for an update, and I do hope
to have changes on it soon, so maybe you'll publish your new
creolized/pidgin IAL you seem so fond of...

Since

I think it means king/emperor, and "tsar" also.
"Tsar" supposedly derives from "Caesar",
coming through German and meaning "emperor".

[Dear Alexander, 
  Great that you do so much work.  Thank you!!! 
  At the moment I am adding some "G"-marks (marks for words with Greek 
origin) with help of the book "Glosa 6000" to the Internet Dictionary. 
I thought, the 6000-list is completely inserted already.  But while 
adding "G"s I unfortunately found some errors in the data.  And a lot 
of English meanings are missing.  It seems necessary that the complete 
6000-list will be checked and not only the G-words. 
  For your work I send a list with the done corrections.  I hope it 
helps and does not lessen your motivation.  When I am through the 
6000-Gs I send an dictionary update to you as soon as possible. 
  The problems are mainly in the 6000-words.  The words with "1" and 
"++" are more stable.  When you take these words first, you will also 
get an useful dictionary earlier.  So I wanted to do with the German 
version, but I did not find time for this work yet. ]

Hmm, Glosa 6000 has less words than Robin's file on disk. Do you work with
Internet dic. or with g-e.all?

Yes this work is very difficult. But for me is more easy, because I  make it
through clipboard by my English-dictionary-program.

A guy on another list posted these links, which are

> http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.dict

... because it suddenly occurs to me that this list
of 493 "concepts" based on Roget's, like Glosa's vocab
reportedly was too, could be re-translated directly
back into Glosa to ensure they are really in there.

Speedwords also has a true system of derivation, which
theoretically generates something like 20,000 words total.
Glosa lacks that, still, but why not add it? Might be
a fun/instructive exercise just to try.

"
MEGA-GLOSA, BUT ...
===================

As regards your first suggestion.  We agree that to sell Glosa to
bodies such as EEC, UN, UNESCO etc. MEGA-GLOSA, a large vocabulary is
essential.  Scientists, literary people and politicians require it.

We however insist that GLOSA 1000 must remain the Centre, the Heart of
Glosa.  Glosa is a truly International Auxiliary Language.  It will
appeal to the motivated Third World artisan only if it is simple to
learn and accurate, and able to deal with all kinds of information
exchange.  Glosa will not be allowed to fall into the trap of becoming
only a holiday language for wealthy people of the industrialized
nations.  The world will never be healthily united until accurate
information is readily available to everyone everywhere, and everybody
in the world has enough to eat, good shelter and a good-allround
education - an education for living not merely for earning a living.
The world has now the means (but not yet the will) to bring all this
about quickly and thoroughly.

Europeans are used to large vocabularies, which can contribute to mis-
understandings not only between nations but also between classes.  We
hope that although perhaps enjoying the variety and freedom of Mega
Glosa people will at the same time work their way up to Central
Glosa 1000.

Below we make some provisional suggestions for forming a Mega
Vocabulary.  Glosa 6000 by the way has all the information for forming
a truly enormous vocabulary.  We shall bring out a Mega Glosa as soon
as possible.



FINDING THE ROOT
================

All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa is to be able to
recognize a Latin and Greek root.  Most of the common ones will be
listed in Glosa 1000, the others will be in Glosa 6000.  In any long
word of classical origin there may be ...

        Prefix - root - suffix.
   Eg.  SUPER     FLU     OUS

Remember Glosa has no parts of speech; and any Glosa word can act as
any part of speech.  Because the suffix is usually concerned with this
kind of information, whether the word is verb, noun, adjective or
adverb it is usually superfluous for Glosa and can be removed.

If the Prefix is one with a distinct meaning i. e. one of the
35 listed in PGN 36 this must be retained as it contributes to
meaning, to information.  So generalizing;

   Word minus suffix = Prefix + root.

                       the word you want.
In the above example the root is FLU, to flow, SUPER over; therefore
SUPERFLU, overflow.  In a way forming a Mega Glosa Vocabulary involves
'tail-chopping'.



POINTS TO NOTE
==============

Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate.  All you have to do here is
knock off the -te.  confiscate becomes KONFISKA.

Always substitute K for hard Latin c.  So canine becomes KANI, feline
FELI.

Some words ending -age are of French origin.  These can be kept giving
MESAGE, FOLIAGE.

No double letters in Glosa, except on a few occasions where a
well-trilled r may have a good echoic effect.  Some examples;

 English        GLOSA
 delicious      DELICI        degenerate  DEGENERA
 industrialize  INDUSTRI      subsequent  SUBSEQUE
 contortion     KONTORTI      population  POPULA

In 99 % of all cases this simple method will work perfectly, but
occasionally some part of the suffix may be found useful and can be
retained.

Words ending -ism  add -o.   REALISMO.  KOMUNISMO.
Words ending -ist  add -i.   REALISTI.  FATALISTI.
Words ending -ment add -a.   PARLAMENTA.  MOVIMENTA.

Biological and medical terms remain unchanged; OAKTREE is QUERKUS.
K can be substituted for Latin C.  Musical terms remain unchanged,
many of these were listed in PGN 16.  Eg. KRESCENDO, FORTISIMO,
DIMUNENDO, ACELERANDO.  French endings like -age above should be
given the French pronounciation.



THE TWO PARTS OF THE LATIN VERB
===============================

Another possibility of variety arises from the fact that the Latin
verb has two parts, each of which gives rise to great numbers of
Euro-verbs.  Eg;
  to see         infinitive       VIDE  as in VIDEO
                 past participle  VISum as in VISion.
So for GLOSA 'to see' can be rendered by VIDE or VISI.  Other
examples;
  join together  i.               NEKT  as in conNECT
                 pp.              NEXU  as in NEXUs.
  to lead        i.               DUCE  as in reDUCE
                 pp.              DUCT  as in conDUCT.



WHEN IS A WORD INTERNATIONAL
============================

In PGN 35 there was an article on PACTERM, Pan-African-Centre for
TERMinology, centredin Addis Ababa.  All the participants at a recent
seminar in Ethiopia agreed that a term should be recognized as
international when it appeared in French, German, Russian and English.
We use a very large German-Russian Dictionary published in Moscow by
A. A. Lepinga & Straxhovoi.

See also, the article about INFOTERM in this issue.



KOSMOPOLITAN GREEK
==================

It has been said that if all the words of Greek origin were suddenly
removed from the world's dictionaries all intelligent conversation
would come to an end.  Nowadays scientists turn almost exclusively to
Greek for new terminology.  Three ways by which you can recognize
words of Greek origin.

1) There are many double consonants. Eg;
   PSYCHOLOGY, CATARRH, RHYTHM, THEME, ARCHITECT, HYPHEN, PNEUMONIA.
2) There are many diphthongs; Eg
   EUPHONY, HAEMOGLOBIN
3) All those words in which ch is pronounced like a k.  Eg;
   ARCHITECT, CHARACTER.

The Greek words are not quite so familiar yet as the Latin, but they
are daily becoming ever more so.  TELE-SCOPE, SYMBOL, SYMPTOM,
SYMPHONY are all Greek, and they never have undergone any changes.
They are however far more international than the Latin.  They
probably make up a half of Glosa 6000; and the Advanced Glosa
Dictionary is almost entirely Greek.

> a victim of English's ridiculous spelling

I used to think that way, but now I think it's only
the English pronunciation that is ridiculous.
Same for French. Our archaic pre-sound-shift spelling
preserves all the beautiful Greco-Latin derivatives.

Glosa was originally based on these derivatives,
but the relationship was lost by a naive and misguided
"fonetic" spelling. There are many people in Europe
who cannot speak or understand English *speech*, but
can read/write it very acceptably because of these
cognate words and their formal book-study.

Occidental was based on "archaic" etymological spelling,
which remains recognizable across most European languages
today in derivative/scientific words. This is the true
international vocabulary, natural and non-apriori.

So I recommend that English/French/Spanish all return
to a truer etymological spelling, and adjust their
pronunciation to fit the writing, not the reverse!
If that were done, we would find that 50% of the words
are identical, and not need any artificial interlanguage.
This E-F-S language that already exists in writing
covers 4 of the 7 continents and half the population ...

Glosa should join that party, in its next revision.

Nice polemic, good thought.

> Europeans are used to large vocabularies

Those vocabularies are built using relatively few
(5000) roots and a set of derivational affixes.
There is a natural system to it, somewhat irregular.
The task of a designed language should be to identify
the roots, spell them in the most internationally
recognizable fashion, and provide a regular set of affixes.

> All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa

Dangerous idea, I like it.

> Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate.

Also, -ion, -ive, -ous, -ary, -ory, -ble, -bly, -ure,
and about 200 others. In Spanish, same story.

> Always substitute K for hard Latin c.

Big mistake, because it breaks the derivational families,
e.g. FACt/FACile conDUCive/DUCtile ... myriads more.
Same for soft-G. Better to throw out K and Q both.
And Z and X and W and maybe Y. And H. But J may be useful.

Latin, -aticus; present in every European language as
-age and related -agie but spelled often with J.

> No double letters in Glosa

I think that's also a mistake: "ad + cept = ac-cept",
"in + rigare = irrigate". Anything that disguises etymology
also prevents recognition and is evil.

> Words ending -ism  add -o.   REALISMO.  KOMUNISMO.

You are being too reasonable, nobody will agree to that!
Anyway, better to leave out useless final vowels altogether,
maybe even use "realist, realism, realistic, realisar,
realisat, realisation, realisator, ..."

> Biological and medical terms remain unchanged

Scientific terms mutate more swiftly than the flu virus.
Nobody understands such jargon, why bother with it?

> Musical terms remain unchanged,

> Eg. KRESCENDO, FORTISIMO, DIMUNENDO, ACELERANDO.

Only 1% of the population will ever hear music of that type,
sad to say. It's just jargon anyway, doesn't belong in an IAL.

> THE TWO PARTS OF THE LATIN VERB

Very interesting stuff, but I doubt the Glosa authors
ever studied Latin or other interlanguages ... deaf ears.
Maybe I'm being too harsh, and I hope so. What we need is
a "Glosa Academy" to design version 3, if it is to survive.

> WHEN IS A WORD INTERNATIONAL

> international when it appeared in French, German, Russian and English.

German has not embraced the international roots, therefore
must be left out: there aren't many roots common to this set
of languages. Better is Spanish/English/French: there are
at least 20,000 words available, to be reduced to 5000 roots.
(Spanish could be augmented by Portuguese, to avoid ill-effects
of its unfortunate PL-->LL etc. sound changes.)

I would eliminate Greek, but the other Glosa people won't.
Many reasons, but I'll leave that for elsewhen.

What a brave attempt by Marcel, to raise so many issues at once!
And they are mainly the essential ones. I hope Wendy will
take this *positively*, though I somehow don't expect so.
If 10 or so people decide to make a new reformed Glosa, though,
it could actually happen and might be very successful.

For myself, I can't quite see which way Glosa *should* evolve.
More like the naturalistic Novial/Occidental? More creolish
like Lingua Franca? More Greek like the Koine? Something else?
Whatever, I'd just like it to be more consistent and true
to its own principles, whatever they may be.

I am not sure, whether it became clear, so please let me note:  What I 
have posted 00-10-14 was an article of "Plu Glosa Nota", issue 37, the 
official Glosa newspaper. 

These are original words of the Glosa authors, Ron and Wendy, not 
mine!!!

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com

This is part of my personal G to E dictionary from the standard internet one. 
The words I've put aside are in files I've put on different messages.It will 
get further pruning as time goes on and will be somewhat shorter than the 
original. I'm rather of the opinion that many of the hyphens could be 
dispensed with and the dictionary could be with advantage shortened still 
further.  The dictionary has "ad ", "epi" , "ad-epi" . if  "ad-epi" became 
"ad epi" we would need only 2 entries instead of 3 and if all the entries 
beginning with "no-*****" were " no *****", there would be a large saving of 
space.

email cut short grandson had his hand stamped on at football suddenly needed 
phone/ casualty etc not badly hurt......
re the spelling, it could be easier to get the standard pronunciation altered 
as gradually as charles suggests - a compromise might be possible whereby the 
spelling draws closer to the pronunciation and vice versa

When learning a natural language like French,
or in my case trying but not succeeding,
the major difficulty is that any variance from
Parisian usage is *wrong* and unacceptable.

But in an artificial bridge language,
there needs to be tolerance for variation.
All the users are new learners, and they must
feel free to speak/write without becoming
a target for criticism.

So any reasonably understandable spelling or
choice of words or etc should be encouraged as
necessarily *correct*. The only criterion for
proper usage is understandability. Good style
will be determined by popularity in actual use.

English went through a long period of unstandard
spelling, which did stop Shakespeare from using it
effectively, but stern schoolmasters were unhappy ...

The Glosa Internet Dictionary on my site has been updated again.  

Changes: 
- "G"-marks (for Greek words) have been added with the book 
    "Glosa 6000". 
- The English meanings of these Greek words have been compared, the 
    found errors corrected and missing English meanings added 
    (About 200 things.  A check of the complete Glosa-6000-data is 
    necessary.). 
- The alphabetical sorting has been improved. 

The corrections are protocoled in 
  www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz . 
Lines 1800 to 1986 may be interesting for Alexander, Robin and all 
users of Robin's GLOSA.ALL-file.  Because GLOSA.ALL has been one of 
the source files for the Internet Dictionary, a lot of the found 
Dictionary's errors are in GLOSA.ALL, too.  I posted the examples A to 
H in Glosalist 00-10-04 already. 

I sent a paper copy of the dictionary to Wendy Ashby.  

URLs as before.  Place visita.  Saluta Marcel.
