Hi, Paul,
If you wish I can send you the info on how to ftp
to the site any files you wish to store there.
Just let me know and I'll email you privately
the username and password.

Since,
Jay B.

    Jay, I have to say honestly that I do not recall your message. 
However, 1) my memory is not as good as it used to be; and 2) there was
a while that I was not subscribed to Glosalist, so I might have missed
it, anyway.

    I took a hasty look, and it seem as if they have most of the
material, although I did not check for all eight files.  (See below.)

    Actually, there are two large files, the Basic Reference and the
spelling checker for MS-DOS (which might run in a DOS window under
Windows, although I have not tried it).  Altogether there are eight
files, totalling 290156 bytes as they sit on my ISP's Linux server. 
(The exact byte count might vary on a Microsoft-based server.)

    I moved them off GeoCities back when Yahoo took it over and there
was some hullaballoo about copyright issues.  I placed links to where
they sit now.  If someone will definitively take over all eight files
(I would like the spelling checker to go, too), I will place links on
my site pointing to the new site.  Whether I can change the links on
GeoCities I don't know, as I have not tried to access those link-files
in a looong time, and as best I recall I had difficulty the last time I
ever tried.

    You may send me the information.  However, I want to make it clear
that I am looking for someone who is willing to take over the
RESPONSIBILITY for the Glosa www pages and not merely provide some
space for them.  Sorry if I did not make tha sufficiently clear in the
beginning.

*    Thank You, Bill,

       This is a nice offer.

  

       I would adjust my Website to give your location, AND the Glosalist archives, in a new update .. if you and Paul can negotiate the transfer of files that would otherwise be lost.


       I am using AceFTP, and this is a very smoothe program for the job, which I was putting off, and putting off, until I had a free mind to concentrate on the 'ordeal.'  Doing the webpages has been a snip - being able to dummy them up on a floppy disk, then to transfer them all to the ISP's computer.  But, I wasn't looking forward to it.

       Once into the swing of it, I decided to do a version of the Glosa history: while the kocher, Richmond, version does not actually mention me, the one on my webpages does.

       Sadly, I have got cauught up in the whirlwind of the 'interesting times' and am closely following the Seattle WTO story: I feel that what happened is one up for the good guys.  If Glosalistas feel that there is any hope of IAL adoption - this side of the Revolution - then I will get active again.  But the hot topic is definitely the putsche from the Transnatioals attempting to take over the world: there seems little room, in their plans, for a democratic, Common Second Language for the world.

       I certainly feel that Glosa's beauty should not be lost.  What worries me is the extremely small number, who follow their interest in Glosa with writing it in prose.  Perhaps we ought to institute a special status, with special title, for anyone who writes a story of treatise of over one page, in length, using Glosa!  Zamenhof did, for Esperanto.

       Maybe "Glo'Sko-pe" would do the trick.  What does the panel think?  Sends your suggestions for the title to this List.

       Possibly, to publish stories and original non-fiction articles, an e-zine needs to be instituted.


Saluta,

  Robin Gaskell.

    Yes, I will surf these sites, and will send items to you for inclusion.
    I would like some other Glosalistas to consider writing in, or on,
Glosa for your pages also.

    What it means is that once someone else takes over the files, I
will put links to them on my web space (which are already linked to
from the old GeoCities site), and thereafter I wash my hands of them 
to have whatever life anyone else will give them (although I have
parked a zipped copy on my home machine for safekeeping).  My pages had
the approval of A&C in Richmond, and excerpt for the introductory page
all the material was theirs.  Anyone who took them over would have any
responsibility for negotiating with Richmond anything else having to do
wiht copyrighted material.

Oh man, when will people learn ... Abandon the Microsoft nazis
and get Linux today! No more viruses, cheap and easy updates
under your control, multiple user logins on the same machine
for family use. Besides much higher performance in every sense.
Run your own web/mail servers, post 10gb of data if you want. Etc.

&   A Good Effort, Marcel,

    You demonstrate possibly the main aspect of learning Glosa: using it. 

    And you do so very well.  By trying to express your-self using Glosa, you will feel the words locate themselves with best fit.  This feeling grows with practice.

    Do you have trouble thinking in German, and then, thinking in Glosa?


    Regarding re-locating existing Web-pages in your own Web-site, this action is very logical: if you do not translate this information into German, who will do it?  When you translate the pages from Richmond, U.K.  

- possibly from Paul Bartlett's Website - please give recognition to the authors.  

    If you use items from my Web-site, possibly you will include a note about me, but only for reasons of history.

    Do you have the feeling that inclusion of "Seminar #1" will help future Glosa students in Germany?

  [N.B. The languge of Linguistics is not fully worked out for Glosa, but Seminar #1 should translate readily into German .. if you think it fits in a Web-page.]

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

<excerpt><smaller>Hello Robin!

Thank you for your interesting observations    .....    feel that there
is enough to learn without having to overcome contradictions and
inconsistencies - that was my reaction anyway. 

</smaller></excerpt>** Hi David,

    The main problem, for me, with these base-level annoyances in the
Glosa lists, is that I do not have a printing press, and that while
refining these matters - to "standardise" Glosa - I had a computer
wipe-out with a virus.

It was complicated, and I was off the Net for a month, which was enough
to take the impetus away from the Glosalist, whose members were working
on it.

    So, For the many non-Networked Glosa-pe printed paper copies of the
dictionaries is all they have.  Howevber, for the Netted Glosa-pe, we can
change the spelling and remove unwanted synonyms, but this was taking a
long while to reach concensus. 

    Also, we had the other problem of 'copyright' and the authors'
dominance and moral suasion.  But, for financial reasons, Clark and Ashby
while joining the Internet, were not active on it, and did not join the
Glosalist discussions.

    So, I was creating what could almost be seen as a parallel
administration of Glosa, and I needed to maintain good connections with
the authors at the same time.  That was just the way it was.

    Now, however, Glosa's basic plan is just as good as it ever was, but
the authors are not able to maintain as active a role as they had.  So, I
could exert a stronger influence in the works: I could buy a laser
printer, so that dictionaries I print will not run when wet (as
bubble-jet does); and I could complete the "Glosa 2500 Learner's
Dictionary" that was nearly ready when I got virussed: also I could
become much more active in the creation of learning materials, such as
cassettes and instruction books.  But ....

    Just when I started bouncing back from the wipe-out, other ..
non-linguistic .. problems arose on the horizon.  Had there been no worry
about the survival of basic Democracy, I would have happily put all of my
effort into getting Glosa off the ground.

    I am not sure how much you know about the MAI, G7 or WTO, but there
really was good reason for all of those people moving into Seattle to
alert the world to its perilously dangerous situation.  I an afraid that
political forces are far stronger than those of language reform, and that
we will probably see Capitalism collapse - as cataclysmically as did
Russian Socialism - before we see world leaders decide to act on the IAL
hypothesis.  I am working on the question of which system follows
Capitalism when it has been discredited.



<excerpt><smaller>  I accept your point regarding creativity (where would
humanity be without it?) and if the language should ever become accepted
and used as an IAL then change, innovation, creativity should follow
naturally (as happens with languages anyway). 

</smaller></excerpt>**   The bad news is that there isn't much spare
creativity about: most creatives are busy exploiting their imaginations
as song-writers, pop musicians, advertising copy-writers, hack
journalists, novel-writers, etc.

     Very few are employing their creative abilities altruistically to
prevent our civilisation from falling into the abyss.  In a round-about
way, I am saying that I have been distracted, by events, from applying
myself single-mindedly to the success of the IAL.


<excerpt><smaller>  Whilst Glosa is in its infancy (with regard to
becoming known and accepted) I do believe that it should be made as
simple as possible and presented in such a way that its functionality
cannot be criticised. 

</smaller></excerpt>**   And it is obvious, as well.  The authors did
simplify Hogben's pattern considerably, and Glosa is now recognised as
the Planned Language with th most simplified structure.  But, on
functionality, the authors misjudged the need for regularity on the part
of the majority of mankind.  They did not standardise the dictionary
spellings; but, for reasons of cost, kept printing the same wordlists ..
even though the lack of standardisation was reported, to them, as being
irksome to many learners.


<excerpt><smaller>  Faulty dictionaries, contradictory word endings, more
than one word to represent a definitive idea (in the basic 1000 words at
least) allows areas for criticism which could be avoided without too much
trouble.   It is easy to criticize of course but there are other areas of
concern to me.   Firstly I don't really understand why punctuation needed
to be changed from the conventional (when writing Glosa as I did some
five years ago I found myself keeping to conventional punctuation - and
only used colons and semi-colons where I would normally have done when
writing English.

</smaller></excerpt>**    This is a tricky one.  However, I suspect that
there is such a thing as a "Grammar of Punctuatuion."  It is possible,
that, as evolved as it is, an also as conventionalised as it is, English
punctuation might be right for the way English works, but not necessarily
for the ways some other languages work.

      I tried to understand what Ron Clark was doing, when he introduced
specialised punctuation rules for Glosa, and I try to apply them .. to
see if they are 'funcional.'  When I 'think in Glosa' I use the Ronald
Clark system of punctuation - more or less; and, when I think in English,
i tend to use a standardised version of English punctuation.  And I note
that when I give Glosa and English versions of the same sentence, they
might be differently punctuated.

      As an explanation, not an excuse, I would mention that Glosa,
having a 

syntax-based grammar with uninflected words, means that sometimes the
puntuation needs to do some of the grammatical work: I liken it to the
use of a shoehorn - to make sure that things go into the right place, IE
are understood by the reader to articulate in the way intended by the
writer.  Then again, in spoken Glosa, vocal inflection gives us the
internal structure of the sentence, much as punctuation does in written
text.  So, in Glosa, I might say that good punctuation is more important
than it is in English.  There probably is a clear relationship between
written punctuation and the vocal inflection that it is used to indicate.
 You are having trouble with the fact that Glosa and English have a
different set of ground-rules to indicate this relationship.

      Although Ron did not express it as functionally as I do, Glosa
phrases are 'flagged' with a starting comma, and Glosa Clauses are
'flagged' with a starting semi-colon.  This is not a hard and fast rule,
so that semi-colons can be elided to commas; and commas can be elided
out.  However, where it seems necessary to mark the sentence structure
for reasons of clarity - and with Glosa's simplified form, this may
become necessary - then the mechanism, to do so, exists.

      Most English-speakers claim that an excess of semi-colons makes a
sentence look ugly.  And this may be so.  But were the language taught
functionally, then learners would happily use the "start of clause" mark,
so that the reader had no trouble in understanding the structure of his
sentence.


EG  Fe pa ki a fe domi; qi habe loka to u buta de u via.


   She went (to her) home, (which is) located at the end of the road.


    Fe pa ki domi; loka to u buta de u via.


In Glosa the same functional punctuation, the semi-colon, is used
whether, or not, there is elision.  While I could have 'puristically'
placed a comma after LOKA to indicate the start of a subsidiary phrase,
this structure was obvious, and I elided the comma.

    Had Ron Clark thought differently, he mght have invented unique
punctuation marks for Glosa - to avoid confusion with the established
usages for the traditional marks of English.

    Since having thought about the 'function' of punctuation, as it
applies to Glosa, I have loostened up my own markings in normal English
.. especially on the Net, EG

   raining ^cats and dogs^

   well .. only at Christmas

   he *really* got angry

   then, I knew ... it was the flat battery

   couldn't move; but, when it growled


<excerpt><smaller>   Also I found it rather annoying when reading Plu
Glosa Nota to come across words that I couldn't fathom the meaning of
which didn't appear in the dictionaries.    Subsequently advice was given
to use an Italian dictionary to supplement Glosa vocabulary - do you
think that is sound advice - what are the alternatives with regard to
expanding the vocabularly? 

</smaller></excerpt>**   Agreed it was a bit silly, however I use mainly
the Latin dictionary for word divination and creation, and on rare
occasions I consult the Greek one.

     Italian is relevant to pronunciation: borrow a cassette of spoken
Italian, and you hear Glosa's sounds.


<excerpt><smaller>   Also what do you think about the practice of naming
days and months by numbers?   Is it not just a bit too 'clinical' - too
detached?  (I'm having difficulty in expressing conveying what I mean
here).   Days and months tend to have recognisably internationalised
names and are usually learned without too much difficulty - personally I
know I would have found it easier and quicker to have learned names
rather than to have tried to work out which day di sixa represented or
which month is meno seti.   The dictionaries do give some names but not
all. 

</smaller></excerpt>**   While it might be more human to have folksy
names for days and months, it is probably more 'ecumenical' to
standardise the calendar mathematically, at least for beginners; once
people have moved up to a dictionary with synonyms, they then should have
no problem in being understood using either "Januari" or "Mo 1".


<excerpt><smaller>  I suppose that my experience with Esperanto showed me
the advantages of a well controlled language although this too can be
problematical if "conservatives" refuse to budge when innovation is
called for - and I am referring to the reluctance to accept change
concerning  the accented letters which  many Esperantists wanted to
abolish so as to make the language more user friendly, particularly  with
regard to the computer.

</smaller></excerpt>**   Yes, we have some conservatism in Glosa too: as
Esperantists think accent marks are OK, some, in Glosa, think variable
spellings are OK.  But full standardisation is needed for any language
that is intended for use within all cultures!  This was, originally to
have been achieved by the Glosalist.

<excerpt>  

<smaller>Yes, I am still interested in the Glosa social invention - I am
a "one world" person who does not consider that he has a country - the
absolute opposite of a patriot/nationalist.   Part of my
political/economic/social outlook embraces the need for an IAL (or as I
mentioned before any language that may be universally acceptable).  

</smaller></excerpt>**   Interesting themes here: a community-based
society probably is more likely to be 'patriotic' than 'globalised'.  And
centralisation of power and wealth are proving to be major evils of this
Later Phase of Capitalism.  So, does Interlingualism favour the
centralisation of power, or does it maintain the strength of community?


<excerpt><smaller> At the moment my wife and I are struggling to learn
some Spanish -and it is because of this (added to some disillusion with
Glosa for reasons stated)  that I put Glosa on the back burner for a
while.   We go down to Spain for a camping holiday during Feb & March so
for that period I will not be available.   This email was started a few
days ago but then put aside whilst I endeavoured to download your
seminars - I could't transfer them to 'word' - had to 'phone my son who
knows about these things  - anyway to cut the story short I got at them
through 'notepad' this morning but I will not  have time to digest them
properly before going away so will print them off and take them  with
me.

</smaller></excerpt>** Happy travelling in Spain, and success with the
language.  Spanish is the major second language in the southern states of
the USA.  I have tended to keep in ASCII, where possible; perhaps I will
need to adopt a newer w.p. convention.

<excerpt>Wordpad is much better than Notepad.

  

<smaller>I see with interest that you are a jazz enthusiast and I am also
(where trad is concerned).   Unfortunately I do not have your gift of
being able to play a musical instrument and my singing (in or out of the
bath) brings on an amused smile from my wife.   We do manage to  get away

Again I am writing in Glosa AND English because I have to

Dear Robin, dear glosalist-members,
nice that you visited my website.  Has anybody else been
there ?  Thanks for your compliments, thanks for the link
in your glosalist-mail-signature.  Please put a link to my
site on your webpage too.  Thanks for your texts
"Seminar #1" and "Seminar #2".  How many seminars are
there ?  Why don't you put them all on your website ?
There are no further reactions to my site.  That is because
I wanted to present it to the glosalist-members first,
before I go to Yahoo and other web catalogues.  I think that
I will not get a personal mail as reaction.  A reader of my
page would rather subscribe glosalist.  Maybe this can help
that nearly all of glosalist-members are native English
speakers.  Who is on glosalist who is not native English
speaker ?  Please write.  ---]

Hi Marc .. OR .. Karo Marc (as we say in Glosa),

At 01:14 11/02/2000 -0800, you wrote:

>Dear Robin,

>up. My e-mail address is marcwathen{at}yahoo{dot}com .

*  Thanks for the feedback.  And, yes, email is quicker, and allows the tranfer of more data.

*   The list is almost endless; it more, or less, began in the Renaissance, with the members, of the newly set up Royal Society, deciding there ought to be a language for ALL scientists.

    Now it seems like a bazaar, from which one selects the language one likes.

    However, there is a catch: nobody can decide which is the best of the Planned Languages; but, if the world is to have _A_ Second Language, only one of them can be successful in achieving this quest.


>   How does Glosa compare to Esperanto? 

*   For your purposes, travelling widely, and meeting new people - with whom you can communicate directly - Esperanto WINS.

    If, on the other hand, you take a longer, possibly more intuitive, view, you could see that the race is not yet won, and that Glosa could be a more suitable modern language.

    Esperanto has the infrastructure, a vast library of books, and an army of speakers.  The only drawback is that it is a bit hard to learn. With 99% of the world's population ignorant of the International Auxiliary Language (IAL) hypothesis, either way, Interlanguage is still not even a minor area of human endeavour.


>What are the advantages of Glosa over Esperanto?

*   Mainly intellectual, and possibly psychological.  Glosa, designed a century after Esperanto, embodies many of the new views on Linguistics.

So, Glosa is like English, which, of the Euro languages, has the least morphological grammar .. but it progressed with this trend to the Chinese position, where there is virtually no grammatical change to the words. 

    If your psychology sets you up to follow cleary defined patterns and rules, then you will be in tune with the way Esperanto works; however, if you vere towards the creative use of language, you are likely to appreciate the "open plan" nature of Glosa.

    The Esperanto dictionary has been through a number of revisions and is fairly well settled; the Glosa dictionary (Glosa 6000), is reasonably well set, but contains a few inconsistencies, and much more importantly, there are vast areas of human endeavour for which Glosa lexicons have not been derived.  The Glosa advantage is that, in coming from the Classical roots - from which the science terminology also comes - the derivation of new terms is fairly straight-forward.


> Are there any Glosa contacts in Hong Kong?

*   I will have to get back to the authors, in England, on this.

>originally from Beijing. We have a 6 year old son. My

>son was born in Micronesia, the island of Saipan. We

>communicate in 3 languages at home-Cantonese,

>Mandarin, and English.

*   It sounds as if your family could add another language  - for fun -

and in this respect, I suspect that you could easily start using Glosa as a "toy" language, much as some people use Pig Latin.


> I lived in Japan for 6 years and in Thailand for 2

>years. I am interested in auxiliary languages as a way

>to promote world peace and brotherhood.

*  This is a good question, and a worthwhile objective.  It is also the reason that I bought into the Auxiliary language business: I have been an unpaid promoter of Glosa since I first saw it on the drawing board, in 1977.

   However, very dark clouds hang over the "world peace and brotherhood" area, at present.  And because of this, I am putting my first priority into defining the 'post capitalist' socio-economic system; thus, I see Language Reform as just one of the bonuses to mankind that follows the demise of Exploitative Capitalism.  For this reason, I am currently putting most of my free time into looking, positively, at the responsible, frugal, co-operative world that will welcome the IAL hypothesis.

  -----


But, meanwhile, spending some time on Interlinguistics, I would ask if you think that the Seminar #1 should be in my Webpage?  Did I send the Seminar #2?

   Please try writing a couple of short sentences using Glosa.

   Placia, tenta grafo bi brevi frasa uti Glosa.


   The trick, as I see it, is to pre-digest your thinking before breaking out into words.  In English, we say "writing in Glosa" which could be rendered as ~grafo in Glosa~ [writing into Glosa] or ~grafo intra Glosa~ [writing inside Glosa], both of which would be incorrect idiomatic translations from English .. the meaning of which, in this case, is more correctly conveyed by the concept "using."


Saluta,

  Robin Gaskell

It looks to me as if Glosa will be quite dead without someone
to push it. Right now the world is as economically healthy
though poised at the very brink of ecological collapse
as it ever has been, and without having the language tool
FIRST, there is no hope of economic and political reform.
In other words, I think Robin makes the worst possible
strategic error by allowing Glosa's demise. At this point
there is no one else pushing Glosa, and none likely to arise.
Oh well, there is still Occidental ...

Ich entschuldige mich zum Schreiben dieser Notiz auf Englisch.
Ich kann Deutsch gut lesen aber ich habe kleine Erfahrung mit
Schreiben auf deutsch... und mein Glosa ist sehr rostig!

I've updated the Glosa dictionary files at

   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm

There were only a few changes to the words themselves, some things we
talked about shortly after the last update, and I hadn't felt like doing
the whole update thing again so soon. The main change was that HEKTO
replaces CENTI for "hundred"; CENTI becomes "hundredth". This makes some
of the other words more consistent with each other...

   CENTI = hundredth
   CENTIMETRA = centimeter, centimetre

   HEKTO = hundred
   HEKTOPEDI = centipede

   MILI = thousandth
   MILIMETRA = millimeter, millimetre

Also for consistency...

   KARAKTERI = trait
   UNITA = unit

   NIMA = name
   NIMA-BILETA = label

   SUMA-ME = calculator

And the following were added...

   GE-LIMITA = exclusive

   PRANDIA = supper

   RADIA = radius

I also created a new dictionary file, the Glosa-English Basic Dictionary
(GEB), as requested by Marcel for help in his work. (Let me know if there
is anything else I can do to help.) And I added the new Glosa links to all
the cover pages. The password, as always: seleni.

Hey, does anybody feel up to completing my "U Lupus" translation? Or
translating a few lines? Oh please oh please oh please? I'm afraid I
never have found the time to finish it, or to become really good at
Glosa, after concentrating on the dictionaries and then being busy with
other things. I grabbed the original German also from Marcel's site
(Excellent work, Marcel! Great site!) and I'm working on translations
into several other languages.

Posi mi ski; tu puta de qo: 

(ex Richmond folia "History Behind Glosa":) 
"1986 Devised Tako-Glosa, a quick writing system, in which all Glosa 
words can be abbreviated to 1, 2 or 3 letters and can be typed on 
ordinary computerkeyboard." 

Mi pa audi de homo ra in Deutschland. Markus B"ottcher ex Braunschweig 
pa evolve u sistema; te tipo fo tako in normali puta-me. An sistema 
uti "shift"-butona, "alt"-butona e "control"-butona. 

Problema de panto tako-grafo sistema es plu verba fini. Ka-co Glosa es 
boni: id ne habe plu inflectio, e plu verba ne muta. Sed 
Richmond-verba-lista ko konfusi in verba fini (karo e kara, odori e 
odoro, e so avanti) es toxi pro panto tako-grafo-sistema! 

Tako-grafo pa es mi maxi amo libe-tem-ergo. Klu mi pa visita 
panto-Deutsch-kompeti. Mali fortuna u stude tako-grafo es fo ergo, iso 
fo de stude lingua. Posi ma fo: ka-co; qi dice, ne qi grafo; krati 
tako. 

"Tako-Glosa" sio es iso problema de auxi lingua. Idea es boni. Posi-ra 
es mega. Evolve es noo-hedo. Sed pro face utili ne existe dura-dina. - 
Markus B. habe dura-dina. Mi ne. 

Saluta. 

(I think, I know what you are thinking about:  ... [quotation of 
Richmond leaflet "History Behind Glosa"] ...  I heard about a similar 
thing in Germany.  Markus B"ottcher from Braunschweig developed a 
system to type German texts in high velocity in a normal PC.  His 
system makes use of the shift-, alt- and control-button.  A problem 
for every stenographic system are word endings.  So Glosa is quite 
suitable, because there are no inflections and words do not change.  
But the Richmond-vocabulary with its confusions in the word endings 
(karo and kara - dear; odori and odoro - smell, and so on) are poison 
for every abbreviation system! For a long time short hand has been my 
favorite hobby.  I visited even the German masterships.  Unfortunately 
the learning of a stenographic system is very hard work, as hard as 
language learning, perhaps harder, because the speaker and not the 
writer controls velocity.  Tako-Glosa will be the same problem as 
auxiliary languages.   The idea is great.  Potential is big.  
Developing it is an intelectual pleasure.  But to bring it to 
application, there is no staying power.  - Markus B. has it.  I do not. 
Greetings.)

*   Hi Nick and All,

   Well, Tako-Glosa was derived by Ronald Clark as a demonstration of the
flexibility within Glosa, and as the ultimate abbreviation of the Greek
and Latin roots ... for 'telegrammatic' communication.  It is also a
ready-made shorthand for Glosa-users.


   Had more people taken an interest in the language, I am sure that Ron
would have extended the Tako-Glosa vocabulary, and demonstrated its use
more.


   No, it never made it to the Net.  We seemed to be having enough
trouble with straight Glosa.  My print of Tako-Glosa is probably filed
somewhere, but the most direct way of getting a copy, of the work done,

would be to write to Glosa Central:-

  Glosa

  <underline>P.O. Box 18, Richmond Surry TW9 2AU, U.K.


</underline>   Do You have a use for the shorthand version of Glosa, or
are you checking it out for academic reasons?  If necessary, I will write
to Wendy Ashby and ask her to send me a copy of it; afer that, it would
be a matter of my typing it in.


   As I recall, yours is the first enquiry I have seen about 
Tako-Glosa.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

Dear GEOs,

In the Internet I have read the pages of P. Bartlett and R. Gaskell
about your language. I found it interesting, so I want to order 
something from you:

Please send me your books
- "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" and
- "18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa.

Please send me a
- list of available material in and about Glosa
      (books, publications, cassettes, video, etc.).
Then I want to subscribe
- your newsletter "PLU GLOSA NOTA"
for one year.

I aestimate your costs by 30.00 pounds.
  ("Dt.-G. 1000": 3.95 + "18 Steps": 8.95 
  + "P.G.N": 12.00 ? + postage 5.00 ?).
I put the money in this envelope. Write me, if it is not enough. Then 
I send more. If it is more than enough, please put in some more 
information.

Because I think you are interested in spreading your language, I want
to ask: 
Is there any Glosa-material, that I can hand out (on my own costs),
without getting copyright-problems?
Maybe some kind of advertising leaflet?
I promise you: 
-  I will not want to gain by it. 
-  I will always mention the source. 
-  I will not change the material. 
-  I will hand out copies only in German speakers' area. 
I would like to put a German introduction to Glosa and a vocabulary 
list on my internet homepage. Am I allowed to? 

Thank you for all. 

Nice wishes from Hamburg 

Marcel

Dear Marcel,

Thank you for your letter, money + order. In a seperate packet we have 
posted the books and also included some introductory leaflets + 
history. 

Please feel free to translate any of these into German and distribute 
them in English or German locally, nationally or internationally. We 
would be most grateful for your help. Please ask if you need 
additional copies. We do not have many spare copies of the German 
leaflets and you may notice these are slightly out of date, today. 
There are now more languages used in the European Union. If you wish 
to modify the originals in some way to make them more interesting to 
German readers, please do so, - without changing the meaning, of 
course. As you become more familiar with Glosa, you may like to 
discuss with us any suggestions. 

Sorry, we do not have e-mail or Internet access at the moment. 
Our Modem + printer both need up-dating. I (Wendy) have recently 
moved house now next month Ron will probably move. 
So after this upheaval, we will consider buying a new 
multi-media computer rather than buying seperate items and repairs 
etc. Several things are already in boxes and I cannot find the German 
version of Glosa summary. However, you will find the translations in 
"Deutsch-Glosa 1000" dictionary. We also have not had chance to 
publish "Plu Glosa Nota" recently, we shall start again next year when 
life is more settled. 

You are still 15 pounds in credit. I can send you additional PGN's (We 
are up to PGN 83 now) or other books. Please let us know what you 
would find most useful. 

We both have quite a good knowledge of German, so could understand any 
texts you write in your language. We look forward to hearing from you 
again.

(Ron Clark wrote, 2000-02-26, letter received today): 

Dear Marcel,

Thank you very much for your interesting letter..
You mention Gaskell, Bartlett, and Patterson as being responsible for 
the Web-Glosa article.
Bartlett wrote to us a long time ago, and it was he who is responsible 
for the present set-up.
We knew Robin Gaskell many years ago, when he was a teacher in 
England. We have tried to communicate with Robin several times but 
have so far received no answer. He did change his Australian address 
several times, but up to now always informed us about it immediately. 
We have been playing about with the new computer, which, of course is 
very different in many ways from our previous machines. We are very 
pleased with it, and will get on the net within the next few days we 
hope!

You speak of some errors in the Glosa list. Certainly, they must be 
dealt with immediately. You do understand I expect that in Glosa there 
are many latin and Greek suynonyms that would suffice. We do tend to 
go for brevity, however. We shall certainly fully participate in the 
Glosa Mailing List. 

Getting down now to practical details for the future.
I believe you know about the immense and world-wide publicity Glosa 
received as a result of an article about Glosa which appeared in a 
well-known educational magazine, "Language Matters" which is 
distributed to schools and colleges and large firms. It occurred right 
at the start before we had bad time to develop the Glosa idea 
properly. To be able to fully exploit all this delightful publicity we 
should have had a regular group, a lively Glosa society, meeting 
regularly. So that is now our immediate aim....to establish Glosa 
Groups everywhere. 

So Marcel, that's all for now. We would very much like to know your 
oipinion; together, hopefully, with any helpful suggestions you can 
make. We have responded in English because you asked us to. 
Thank you once again for all your heip. We sense an enthusiasm in your 
letter. 
Auf wieder-schreiben!

Ron

    It was my day off to-day, Friday 10th, but sleep debt prevented me from
going back to see the rest of the _IT2000_ computer exhibition: my body
just said, enough.

   Possibly Sunday I will find time to look at the various Websites that
others have reccommended to me.  I will say that Lexically, you have been
the most active, and I understand this on the basis of each contributing
the part that they resonate with best. 
   In my reply to Marcel, I suggested that he might set up a satellite
Glosa site in Germany, and then encourage others to correspond across the
German/English barrier: I think he inferred that I was not maximising
opportunities for Glosa, and he is right.  If I was still as virile as I
was 20 years ago, when I first returned to Sydney from Bournemouth, I would
be more effective.
   Perhaps at this stage of my saga, the Cosmos wants me to progress in my
quest.  I am getting caught up in the larger moves that are polarising the
world into 'greedy' and 'exploited'.   I am also finding that the world's
store of spare creativity is considerably smaller than I had anticipated.
   In an attempt to encourage the formation of a group of Activists, who
would create non-violent ploys for political interventions and
demonstrations, I set up the Mailing List, "creativity": well, things did
not go as I had expected; I thought we would compile a file of activities
from which other - less creative - Activists could make selections.  It was
amazing the number of ways that people can be diverted from a seemingly
obvious central theme.

   Going on from this failure (possibly to another), I have set up another
M.L. called, "nextsystem."  Just imagine that Capitalism suffers a similar
system-collapse as that which brought down Socialism in the USSR!?  What
will replace it??  Hence I ask the question: what is the appearance of the
"Next" system, which avoids the present pitfalls, and is 'sustainable'?
   Obviously, in the present, George-Soros-type exploitative world, there
is no room for ideas that are good for Humanity, like Glosa.  But we must
be waiting in the wings, ready to appear, on cue, when the curtain raises
on the next Act.
   And, if there is to be such a Next Act, perhaps we should set about
writing it, as well as well as getting the scenery ready.  People are
decrying the present system, and they are working on pieces of the puzzle
that is our future; but, somehow, a few generalists are needed to take the
overview, and see how well the suggested pieces fit together to make up a
whole.
   Isn't it amazing: there is no catch-cry behind which progressive
thinkers might muster!  "Commun-ism" has already been used, unfortunately;
"Alternativism" is not very positive; "Sustainablism" is too much of a
mouthful; maybe something general like "Equitism" or Gaianism" might follow
the implosion of Capitalism (estimated for around 2050).

   I know that too much thinking can send one mad: but, what has happened
to the Human Spirit; why are people NOT asking the NextSystem question?
We can all see that Capitalist exploitation of the Planet has turned toxic;
and any scoolboy could do the Compound Interest sum that shows a continuing
+3% annual increase in GNP, for every economy, leads, eventually, to a call
for resources beyond the Planet's capacity.  But, the locomotive is still
hurtling towards the gorge .. even though we can surmise that the 'bridge'
might not be there, when we reach the brink - and no safety loop is being
built, or even envisaged.

MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE 'REAL' WORLD ...
   I would like to try a stanza, or two, of "The Wolf."   Try me with  some
that are difficult conceptually.

such a solution makes 'hundred' and 'hundredth' separate lexical

   Technology causes me problems: John Schilke still hasn't received the
Glosa cassette he requested.  When I rolled out my old copying cassette
player, it failed to work.  As soon as I unpack the replacement, I will
start to get the audio dems moving again.

  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get

  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

I would use the first column (Glosa 1000) words as more generally known.

Also -

zoa (animal)
no-tako = lento (slow)
sieso (shake)

I take "kordiali" to mean "warm" emotionally, something like friendly.

Also "meio" means less/lessen.

Plu ami saluta,

Subject: Re: [glosalist] U Lupus (ANHELO, Synonyms, Dictionaries)
From: William W Patterson <ailanto{at}neosplice{dot}com>
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 2000 22:50:36 -0500

In reference to recent posts by Nick Hempshall and Marcel Springer...

Marcel> anhelo - gasp, pant  (B)

Nick> I prefer "fo-spira" or "astma"

Funny you should mention that. I just ran into "anhel*" a day or so
before your post, while translating another portion of The Wolf into
Esperanto. ASTMA would work, but brings up another issue concerning
Glosa synonyms, one that I haven't dealt with yet, and I'm glad you
brought it to my attention: Why "-ing" words in the Glosa dictionaries?
When I have time I'll make another desynonymization pass, converting
"-ing" words to infinitives as appropriate, and then we can select the
preferred synonyms for those.

ANHELO is from Latin, ASTMA from Greek. Once again we've bumped into
Glosa's Greek/Latin (and sometimes others, see below) multipersonality
nature. (I still think the creators would have been better off sticking
with one or the other and applying the grammar (one of the aspects
of Glosa which appeal to me) to that one source). (It gets even more
confusing when we bump into a Glosa word which comes from one language
but is the same as a word with a completely different meaning in the
other!) In situations like this, I often look to other IALs to see
what they've selected, thus enjoying the fruits of their research
into international words. Esperanto uses "anheli", Interlingua uses
"anhelar", etc... so I'd be inclined to choose ANHELO as the preferred
synonym.

Marcel> semi - half    (G1000; Error in "Core": (?) It must be Latin
Marcel>                 "semi" or Greek "hemi". "demi" is French.)

In the sources I used to construct the dictionaries, SEMI, HEMI, and
DEMI were all found to be Glosa words for "half". Yes, French too.
Though Glosa is based primarily on Latin and Greek, words from some
other languages have snuck in. Why I chose DEMI as the preferred
synonym, I don't recall. One problem with Glosa vocabulary is that in
many cases you will find a short Glosa word with a particular meaning,
and several Glosa words that begin with this same string of characters;
in some of those words the string has the same meaning, because they
were sourced from the same language as the short word, a language in
which that word was actually a prefix. But in other words the meaning
is not the same, because they were sourced from another language, in
which that short word either didn't exist or had a different meaning. I
probably chose DEMI as the preferred synonym because it didn't clash
with the beginning of any other words. But SEMI or HEMI might be a
better choice.

Nick>   ("Glosa 1000" against "Core".
Nick>   "Core"-words are sorted alphabetically.
Nick>   Is the synonym-problem solved - or doubled ???)

I merged Glosa 6000, the several (differing!) versions of Glosa 1000,
and words from other Glosa sources on the Net, to create the Glosa
source dictionary (GES). Glosa 1000 (in its several incarnations) is
*not*, as one might reasonably expect, a subset of Glosa 6000. Thus, the
GES is the worst of all possible worlds when it comes to synonyms, but
hopefully contains the entire Glosa word store. The GES was then pruned
in various ways to create the more basic dictionaries, the most basic
of all being the Core dictionaries (GEC and EGC). There should be no
Glosa synonyms *within* the Core dictionaries, which I hoped would
someday evolve into that fabled G2000 (in the senses of year *and*
wordcount!).

Nick> I take "kordiali" to mean "warm" emotionally, something like friendly.

Me too. But see my next post, in which I conclude that KORDIALI is
a very good choice in this context.

- Salata! - Bill

Saluta, Marcel e plu glosa-pe!

There are some minor differences between the "The Wolf" and
"Der Wolf", so some of my re-wording can be blamed on that.

ms> Ab u monti an nu pa veni ad u vilage.
bp> Kontra-latu de monti an pa veni ad vilage.

Ah, the synonym problem. Don't worry about synonyms unless they
appear *within* the Core dictionary. Particularly with final vowels.
The various dictionaries disagree a lot on final vowels.

ms> Tem pa gene vespera.

ms> An pa atende in densi abies-silvi.

ms> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko kura peri plu fragma de plu horti,
ms> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.
bp> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko cirkumspekt peri plu horti-fragma,
bp> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.

I like that sentence! At first I wasn't sure about the use of KORDIALI.
Is Hesse referring to warmth as in heat or as in welcomeness? And
then I realized that *both* senses are appropriate here! I do prefer
CIRCUMSPEKT to KURA, because it entails the concept of wariness. As
for HORTI-FRAGMA, that's merely a personal preference. What do the
glosalistas think?

ms> Nuli-pe pa es in strata.
bp> Nuli-pe pa in strata.

As per (much) earlier discussions here, ES is not needed when PA, NU,
or FU is used. (I'm even tempted to omit PA in that sentence.) There
was much discussion about redundancy here some time ago; Once the tense
is established, is it necessary to repeat it in the same sentence? Or
for that matter, within the same paragraph? (though that argument is a
bit weaker)

ms> An pa es anxio e ko libido; an pa nikti inter plu domi.
bp> Ko anxio e ko desira an pa skope inter plu domi.

I'm not sure about that one. Comments?

ms> U-la-tem fusili.
bp> Subito stoko.

I have a feeling that the days of U-LA-TEM are numbered. It's too long,
too many syllables, for such a simple concept. Words like that tend to
get shortened with use. SUBITO is a bit different in meaning but I like
it here. I'm not sure about FUSILI vs. STOKO here. STOKO appears to
combine a couple of similar but definitely different ideas.

More to come...

Plu glosa-pe: saluta!

ms> Ab u monti an nu pa veni ad u vilage.
bp> Kontra-latu de monti an pa veni ad vilage.
nh> Epi ma-tele latu de monti, an vide u viki.

I find "kontra" difficult to interpret.
Is it the side you can see from your current position or the side you can't?

bp> Ah, the synonym problem.

The "two words, one idea" concept behind Glosa used to strike me as
problematic too. A theoretically optimal language would not behave
in this way. But now, I wonder if this is not a benefit, in practice.
The extra effort passively to recognise two words is compensated
for by the ability to vary the word in writing/speaking, or
alternatively to use the one that comes more easily to mind.

The problem with your method of resolving synonyms is that it
will almost always result in the selection of the Latin word, where
as I would like the Greek one! Also while all the words published in
the Glosa dictionaries must be legitimate choices in writing/speaking,
I think preference should go to words appearing in a Glosa 1000 list.

ms> Tem pa gene vespera.
nh> Id es proxi nokti.

I feel it is clearer Glosa to use an empty pronoun "id" as 'subject'
for this type of sentence.

ms> An pa atende in densi abies-silvi.

ms> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko kura peri plu fragma de plu horti,

bp> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko cirkumspekt peri plu horti-fragma,

"Po-co" seems better for "then".

For me "es" is required, as I think Glosa sentences have to have a 'verb' 
equivalent.
The "pa" cannot fulfil this role. On the other hand, I think "pa" can be 
omitted if
the context (in this case, the whole story) makes the time reference clear.

Plu Karo Amika,
  The following item is sent as an attachment, because I failed to press
the right button, and wiped this letter off my screen.
  Thankfully, trusty Eudora had heard about such stupidities, and had
retained the otherwise "missing" message.  By going back into DOS, I was
able to fish the "lost" message out of the OUT.MBX file, so this explains

Excellent news Marcel,

   I must follow Marcel, both, by adding some Count-code to my Web-page, and by registering my Website with the search Engines.  Before this, there are several changes I must make to the page: 
 . change the Post Code, for the authors, to the new value, of TW9 1WD,
 . add a link to Marcel's URL,
 . add a counter to the site,
 . and add Seminar #2.

   The authors have a new Post Code, but there is no change to the other details.  You can write to them at:-
     Ronald Clark & Wendy Ashby
     GLOSA
     PO Box 18
     Richmond
     Surry  TW9 1WD
     England

   Also, they have bought a new computer, having traded-in the old model.  In the future, soon, I hope, they plan to re-join the Internet.

   Marcel, what number of Neticens, who visit your website, ask for more innformation, or about joining a Glosa Users group?To how many of these visiters do you post communications in either Glosa or German? 

   Marcel, I would question you concerning the "verba-lista du ne sati", and wish to have you write more about it.  This caused difficulty for you while compiling your Website.  Please write to us about these problems so we can try to solve them with you. 

   What part of ~ ... Traduce de "Glosa Basic Reference" in Deutsch~ caused problems for you,
  simply the use of little practised language,
  the quantity of the work,
  the inconsistent contents of the list,
  or difficulties with the concepts in making a word-list dictionary?

   Or did you have problems of agreeing with ideas expressed in the "Basic Reference"?  I hope that ypou did not translate into German the statement, "Glosa has no grammar."  And I hope you found a different way of saying it, possibly that .. Glosa has no inflections, and, so, Glosa has no changes to the words for reasons of grammar.

Date: Sat, 25 Mar 2000 12:56:41 +0100

Karo Bill, Nick, plu glosa-pe, 

With my short "U Lupus"-translation I was mainly interested in testing 
the "Core"-dictionary. 

Results:
- In spite of the poetic language it worked quite well. Only a few 
  words must be taken from outside (see my list). Good work! 
- "Core" goes far apart from "Glosa 1000", - whatever the ghost 
  "Glosa 1000" is!, so far, that the risk of a schism is given. 
  The mails of Nick indicate a similar opinion. 
  I think it could be fixed, when only some other synonyms would be 
  preferred.  The main effort (the lists, the program) is done. 
  Making some changes in the preferences will gain a lot. 
  I am working on a list of suggestions.  I will send it to Bill, when 
  it is ready, for further discussion. 

Saluta, 

Marcel <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>

Thank you for your comments. It is great to translate a few lines and 
then discuss it in glosalist.  It helps me learning.  It is even 
better for Glosa when we come from different native languages.  A 
discussion on that level produces not only translations but 
literature!  It does not matter, if we make only 13 lines per month.  
We will not fill a library with Glosa-literature, but it is a start of 
it!  Maybe we can continue this. 

Three small things:

  Nick wrote:
  > Also "meio" means less/lessen.
Right.  Sorry.  Mistake in my list.  But in the translation it is used 
the right way. 

  > "kordiali" ... emotion not temperature
I have been afraid of that already (cf. Latin cor, cordis n. - heart). 
Here I used the "Core"-dictionary too strictly.  A few lines earlier 
in the text Hesse told us that a barn means no place of friendlyness 
to the wolf.  It is the place of bloody orgys and massacre.  "Warm" 
means full of living beings, animals to kill and to eat.  Nick 
convinced me of "meso-termo". 

  > subito / u-la-tem / po-co 
I have to learn, that "po-co" is often better than "u-la-tem". 
"subito" (suddenly, abruptly; pl"otzlich) goes in the direction of 
"surprisingly".  Nobody in the street.  Then a shot. - The poet refused 
to mention, that that is a surprise.  Hesse used "da" (then, there), a 
short word, only one syllable.  And it sounds similar to a shot. 
Childrens playing war imitate gunshots with "da".  "U-la-tem" does not 
sound like a shot.  "subito" does not either.  Latin "tum" would be 
great, but it is not a Glosa word, or is it?

(Based on my experiences with Glosa vocabularies, I wouldn't be at all
surprised to find ANHELO and ASTMA represented equally!)

I didn't mean to imply that this was my only method, or even a primary
method. In fact, it's one of the methods of last resort! First I look
within the dictionary, comparing the synonyms with other Glosa words.
Are any of the synonyms found to be parts of other words? If yes, and
the meaning is similar... that's an argument in favor of preferential
status. If yes, but the meaning is very different... then that's an
argument against preferential status.

You are correct, comparison with other IALs would probably result in
increasing Latinization of Glosa. From the point of view of acceptance
of an international auxiliary language, that's probably a good thing.
Latin has had a bigger influence than Greek on languages worldwide, so,
on average, greater Latinization will mean greater accessibility to the
public.

Of course, that aspect of ease-of-learning (at-sight-comprehension and
true-friendliness) is a short-term consideration. In the long-term, word
source and initial recognizability are irrelevant. I kind of prefer Greek
words in Glosa too, *because* they are less familiar (more unusual) and
thus seem to work more smoothly with Glosa's grammar, at least for this
Germanic/Romance user!

I must disagree! What is the "it" that we're talking about, to what is
"it" referring? That "it" is characteristic of certain languages, but
isn't necessary or even usually explicable, except by reference to some
grammatical rule that simply states that "this is what we do". I like
Marcel's version, a nonambiguous subject/verb/object, stating that the
"time became evening(time)".

*Can* "pa" fufill this role? What *is* the role of "es"? Do Glosa sentences
have to have a verb? If so, should they? So many questions! Fair warning:
when it comes to Glosa, I'm a minimalist.

Hmm. I'm still not convinced. To a wolf, that *is* a good thing!
It's a warm place full of food, and a starving wolf in a freezing
winter couldn't ask for too much more than that! That's why I think
that *both* kinds of warmth are appropriate in this context.

I'm not sure that we should expect Glosa words to be made up of meaningful 
sub-elements. Of course they are to some extent because of etymological 
relationships in the source languages, but shouldn't the words be treated as 
unanalysable within the language itself. (Of course, this doesn't apply to 
Glosa own compound words).

Perhaps this region of the IAL spectrum is already too over-crowded.

As I say the "id" is an empty pronoun in my sentence, so it doesn't refer to 
anything. It is just filling the 'slot' in the syntactic structure. I'm not 
saying that it is a 'logical' or 'natural' requirement in a language, but as 
the 'slot' in the syntactic structure is what gives specific 'meaning' to 
the words in Glosa, perhaps it is not a bad idea to have a mandatory 
subject.

For me "(TEM) time/duration cannot become evening", though maybe it can be 
done with HORO. ~Horo pa gene vespera.~

I think they do have to have a verb to be a Glosa sentence.
Like the 'id' question, I don't think that it is a 'logical' or 'natural' 
requirement in a language, just the way Glosa is at this point in its 
evolution.

My syntax based view of ~Nuli-pe pa in strata~
No-one in-streeted. => No-one entered the street.

So the role of "es" is to stop that interpretation.

A kron,

Nick

but how could I desist longer, with all this
interesting talk about vocabulary and syntax ..

Glosa has the least morphology, the most English syntax,
and the highest proportion of Greek, of all its serious
IAL/auxlang competitors. Its grammar is the easiest
to teach, simply by saying "forget school grammar,
it's like this" and showing a few examples. Still, there
must be a rational pattern to it as I think Nick explains
in a fresh and convincing manner. My own attempts to
write parser programs have led me to the following:

English and Glosa both follow a simple and flexible pattern of
syntax in which "little words" precede and "big words" follow.
This applies to noun and verb phrases, and outside of literature,
that is *all* that needs specifying. So, one expects to see
something like prepositions and determiners initiating noun phrases,
and particles/auxiliaries initiating verb phrases. Easy as pie
to parse, though the connection between phrases is "semantic"
and loose. That's just the way language is, outside of a classroom.

Glosa has some problems though, in my honest opinion, and
requires a lot more work before it can be used in the real world.

Karo plu ami,

Mi sio grafo: "per ma-grafo Glosa, tu Glosa-uti ma-boni".

De "pre u-ci" -

"Pre" is a time word, so what follows it has to be
a time or an event, this gives "u-ci" the meaning
the latter event, ie the registration as opposed
to the code addition, or following Marcel's example.
If you meant before "all the events I just mentioned",
then, "po-co" would be what I would suggest.

De "Mi nece duce Marcel bi" -

I guess you intended "seqe" here.
Marcel bi = Marcel the 2nd :-)
What do you think of "bi-mode"?
Does "nece" indicate that you are being compelled
to do so, as opposed to "volu", wishing to do so,
or "debi", felling that it would be good to do so?

Poli ami saluta,

Nick

*  Of these three, I prefer the construction, because it has the drama of ~fo-~, and does not need to extend the lexicon for this little-used concept.

   Re ~iso ... de~, I have learnt this as "as ... as"

coming across as "AS ... OF/AS/THAN" - making free use of ~de~ as the multifunction preposition.

EG ~An es iso mega de u domi.~  [He is as big as a house.]

    The authors very generously give all three in the G-->E section of Glosa 6000, so it could be a case of take-your-pick.  But:-

  . other concepts in the same lexical space could be seen as possibly causing confusion (demo [people], sema [sign], haemi [blood]),

  . one could/should be chosen for a First Dictionary - without synonyms,

  . The Latin dictionary has a number of uses of both ~semi-~ and ~demi-~,

  . the "D" of 'deuce', `due`, "deux", might favour ~demi~ = in two,

  . SEMI has come to mean "in part", and thus might infer an approximation,

  . with poetry, when dealing with an educated readership, all synonyms should be available for purposes of assonance, alternatively, for the avoidance of alliteration, or simply to follow the muse.

>>================

>>   ("Glosa 1000" against "Core".

>>

*   As Nick points out the first column are generally better known, being from the more frequently circulated Glosa 1000 lists, but I would also add that glosa vocab has undegone a very rpid, artificially induced process of linguistic evolution.  It is with a memory of this developmental saga that I see most of the words in the first list as having been through a 'polishing' process through use, which has resulted in producing words with more or less optimal rhythm, consonant mix, and length.  Also, after the authors declared the terminal vowels to be 'deregulated' (~1989) there was some experimentation with these, and, subsequently, when the 1992 _Glosa 6000_ came out, some had been changed, but it was generally agreed that a set terminal vowel made life easier for everyone.

   ~flu~ lost an additional terminal "E", and ~mei~ was once "MEIO'.


>>lento       - adagio    (slow)

>>animali     - animala   (animal)

>>gradu       - batmo     (step)

>>leuko       - blanka    (white)

>>flu         - flux      (flow)

>>paki        - krasi     (thick) (krasi - thick, grasi - fat ?)

*  ~grosi~ [bulky] G6k


>>bali        - jakula    (cast, throw)

*  ~bali [(to) ball) flows, while ~jakula~ has the awkward "J-K" combination.


>>bate        - kolpa     (hit)

*  ~bate~ flows off the tongue, while ~kolpe has two hard sounds, "K" & "P".


>>meso-termo  - kordiali  (warm)

*  This is a case of the Word-Translation Dictionary not allowing for distinctions between objective and metaphorical usage of the one concept:

  ~meso-termo~ is a physical "middle-heat", while ~kordiale~ is a metaphorical 'heat' from the "heart".


>>soma        - korpu     (body)

>>vulne       - lesio     (wound)

>>mei         - meio      (more)

*  This could be a genuine mistake.  ~ma~ and ~mei~ are unfortunately very close in sound, but opposite in meaning: ~ma~ [more] is from ~major~ [greater]; ~mei~ [less] is from ~meio~ [lessen] ... //inflection in Glosa//?


>>nivi        - nifa      (snow)

>>odoro       - ozo       (smell)

>>no-soni     - placidi   (quiet, still)

*  Another case of objective vs metaphorical use: ~no-soni~ [no sound]; ~placidi~ [calm(ness)] seems related more to the Latin word ``placito`` [to please].  The Latin dictionary gives -

    placidus  gentle, quiet, calm, peaceful, placid, kind, mild.


>>silva       - silvi     (forest, wood)

>>promise     - sponde    (promise)

>>tremulo     - trepida   (shake, tremble)

>>viki        - vilage    (village)

>>

*   ~Mu pa habita u viki intra u silvi.~ [They lived in a village in the woods.]  Both ~viki~ and ~vilage~ are in G6k; but, remember the rules of pronunciation go against the latter, because the "G" is hard. 

  IE, ~vilage~ --> vEE-lARgAY, using the Gaskell system of phonics.  Compare this with ~viki~ --> vEEkEE.

    The G6k has   silvi wood,forest.  Does the "I" sound, and 'feel', better, or have I just conditioned myself to conform with the decision from Richmond, Surry?

*   I wish to add that Glosa is not supposed to be a coldly lexical language, but that the shapes and sounds of the words are also intended to embody their meaning, and feeling.

    This is not actually written down in any of Glosa's promotional literature, but it is something I have intuited: both from observing the language, from the sidelines, as it unfolded; and from developing the taste for the language, by rolling it around in my mouth.

*   Agreed, the multicultural discussion is very fruitful, however, for my
purposes, an English-language version of the poem is probably necessary, to
enable me to maximise my contribution to the discussion.

*
*  Quite so, however I submit the suggestion that some of the discussion
about the poem also be conducted also in Glosa; we are among friends, here,
and any variations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are
uttered.   
   When Marcel and I exchange notes, we use Glosa exclusively, this being
for both our benefits.

*   The four-letter form was the Glosa original, but then the authors moved
to drop the "O" to replace ~meio~ with ~mei~; however, through some
mismatching in my head, this could have resulted in the two forms
persisting - with slightly different meanings, viz, mei = less, and meio =
lessen.

*   The shortage of such expletives, explosives and onomatopoea, as *DA*,
in Glosa could be a fault.
    In 'Old Glosa', ~poi~ [then] gave us the short sharp change in timing.
O.G. also featured ~posto~ [after;afterwards], but this was shortened to
~post~ and ~po~ (~po-~), the abbreviated form; ~poi~ [then] was lost in the
shuffle.
    For literary (and poetic) reasons there might be a case for reviving
the archaic form, ~poi~, in the larger Glosa lexicon.
    ~po-co~ is a different kind of "then": it represents a reflective,
philosophical change of pace, IE
   PO = after
   CO = all that I have said
.: PO-CO = after all that I have said (='and now consider this')

   The closest to ^tum^ is ~tumulu~ [tumult], possibly being a series of
short sharp shouts.

Saluta,
  Robin


  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run. 
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

    But when using a word like TEM at the start of a sentence, it is easy
to misread its use, into thinking of it adverbially.  Here the 'noun
marker', U, comes in very handy: there is not a milisecond of uncertainty
in the mind of the reader, we are dealing with the concept of "time".
 IE:  U tem pa gene vespera.

    This could be minimalised to  ~Nuli-pe es in strata~
       if we know the time-frame is 'past', and we elide the ~u~.

    Alternatively, there is is also the other empty pronoun, IL [=there].
    Using the full form, we could have  ~Il pa es nuli-pe in u strata.~
    With elipsis, this could become  ~Es nuli-pe in strata.~

   I feel the idea of using the particle (pa) instead of the verb (es) to
tell us about the 'action' does not work.  The English equivalent might be
in turning "He entered the room." into "He did into the room."
   Bill, there is some difference in our approach to reductionism: While
you are a minimalist, I am an elipsist.

   Yet, for me, the ultimate judges of grammar are the eye and the ear:
after the initial creative effort of writing, does the sentence, when read
aloud, bring back to mind the original meaning that you intended;
does casually running the eye over the written words instantly 'refresh the
original idea, in your consciousness?  

Saluta,
  Robin

Subject: [glosalist] English Text of "The Wolf" - Hermann Hesse (1907)
From: "Nick Hempshall" <nick_hempshall{at}hotmail{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 01 Apr 2000 10:39:55 PST

The Wolf
- Hermann Hesse (1907)
----------------------------------------------------

Never had there been so cruelly cold and long a winter in the French
mountains. For weeks the air had been clear, crisp and cold. By day the
great slanting snowfields lay dull-white and endless under the glaring blue
sky; by night the moon passed over them, a small, clear, angry frosty moon,
and on the snow its yellowish glare turned a dull blue that seemed the very
essence of coldness. The roads and trails were deserted, especially the
higher ones, and the people sat lazy and grumbling in the village huts. At
night the windows glowed smoky red in the blue moonlight, and before long
they were dark.

It was a hard time for the animals of the region. Many of the smaller ones,
and birds as well, froze to death, and their gaunt corpses fell prey to the
hawks and wolves. But they too suffered cruelly from cold and hunger. There
were only a few wolf families in the region, and their distress led them to
band more closely together. By day they went out singly. Here and there one
of them would dart through the snow, lean, hungry, and alert, as soundless
and furtive as a ghost, his narrow shadow gliding beside him in the
whiteness. He would turn his pointed muzzle into the wind and sniff, and
from time to time let out a dry, tortured howl. But at night they would all
go out together and the villages would be surrounded by their plaintive
howling. Cattle and poultry were carefully shut up, and guns lay in
readiness behind sturdy shutters. Only seldom were the wolves able to pounce
on a dog or other small prey, and two of the pack had already been shot.

The cold went on and on. Often the wolves huddled together for warmth and
lay still and brooding, listening woefully to the dead countryside around
them, until one of them, tortured by hunger, suddenly jumped up with a
bloodcurdling roar. Then all the others turned their muzzles toward him and
trembled; and all together burst into a terrible, menacing, dismal howl.

Finally a small part of the pack decided to move. Early in the morning they
left their holes, gathered together, and sniffed anxiously and excitedly at
the frosty air. Then they started off at a quick, even trot. Those who were
staying behind looked after them with wide glassy eyes, trotted a few steps
in their wake, stopped, stood still for a moment in indecision, and went
slowly back to their empty dens.

At noon the traveling party split in two. Three of the wolves turned
eastward toward the Swiss Jura, the others continued southward. The three
were fine strong animals, but dreadfully emaciated. Their indrawn
light-colored bellies were as narrow as straps, their ribs stood out
pitifully on their chests, their mouths were dry and their eyes distended
and desperate. They went deep into the Jura. The second day they killed a
sheep, the third a dog and a foal. On all sides the infuriated country
people began to hunt them. Fear of the unaccustomed intruders spread through
the towns and villages of the region. The mail sleighs went out armed, no
one went from one village to another without a gun.

After such good pickings, the three wolves felt at once contented and
uncertain in the strange surroundings. Becoming more foolhardy than they had
ever been at home, they broke into a cow barn in broad daylight. The warm
little building was filled with the bellowing of cows, the crashing of
wooden bars, the thudding of hooves, and the hot, hungry breath of the
wolves. But this time people stepped in. A price had been set on the wolves,
and that redoubled the peasants' courage. They killed one with a gunshot
through the neck, the second with an ax. The third escaped and ran until he
fell half-dead in the snow. He was the youngest and most beautiful of the
wolves, a proud beast, strong and graceful. For a long time he lay panting.
Blood-red circles whirled before his eyes, and at times a painful, wheezing
moan escaped him. A hurled ax had struck him in the back. But he recovered
and managed to stand up. Only then did he see how far he had run. Far and
wide there were neither people nor houses. Ahead of him lay an enormous
snow-covered mountain, the Chasseral. He decided to go around it. Tortured
by thirst, he took a few bites of the frozen hard snow crust.

On the other side of the mountain he spied a village. It was getting on
toward nightfall. He waited in a dense clump of fir trees. Then he crept
cautiously past the garden fences, following the smell of warm barns. There
was no one in the street. Hungrily but fearfully, he peered between the
houses. A shot rang out. He threw his head back and was about to run when a
second shot came. He was hit. On one side his whitish belly was spotted with
blood, which fell steadily in big drops. In spite of his wound he broke into
a bounding run and managed to reach the wooded mountain. There he stopped
for a moment to listen, and heard voices and steps in the distance.
Terror-stricken, he looked up at the mountainside. It was steep, densely
wooded, and hard to climb. But he had no choice. Panting, he made his way up
the steep wall, while below him a confusion of curses, commands, and lantern
lights skirted the mountain. Trembling, the wounded wolf climbed through the
woods in the half-light, while slowly the brown blood trickled down his
flank.

The cold had let up. The sky in the west was hazy, giving promise of snow.

At last the exhausted beast reached the top. He was at the edge of a large,
slightly inclined snowfield not far from Mont Crosin, high above the village
from which he had escaped. He felt no hunger, but a dull persistent pain
from his wound. A low sick bark came from his drooping jaws, his heart beat
heavily and painfully; the hand of death weighed on it like a heavy load. A
lone fir tree with spreading branches lured him; there he sat down and
stared forlornly into the snow-gray night. Half an hour passed. Then a red,
strangely muted light fell on the snow. With a groan the wolf stood up and
turned his beautiful head toward the light. It was the moon, which, gigantic
and blood-red, had risen in the southeast and was slowly climbing higher in
the misty sky. For many weeks it had not been so big and red. Sadly, the
dying wolf's eyes clung to the hazy disk, and again a faint howl rattled
painfully through the night.

Then came lights and steps. Peasants in thick coats, hunters and boys in fur
caps and clumsy leggings came tramping through the snow. A triumphant cry
went up. They had sighted the dying wolf, two shots were quickly fired. Both
missed. Then they saw that he was already dying and fell upon him with
sticks and clubs. He felt nothing more.

Having broken his bones, they dragged him down to Saint-Immer. They laughed,
they boasted, they sang, they cursed; they were looking forward to brandy
and coffee. None of them saw the beauty of the snow-covered forest, or the
radiance of the high plateau, or the red moon which hovered over the
Chasseral, and whose faint light shimmered on their rifle barrels, on the
crystalline snow, and on the blurred eyes of the dead wolf.

I hope this new list will include the Glosa 1000 words in it, and extend the

I can across this paragraph in a article by an advocate of a Modified
English as the IAL. I think is interesting in light of the discussions
recently about synonyms.

"Moreover, a defined lexicon may not give an adequate choice of synonyms. A
single word might be sufficient to convey meaning, and quite adequate for
many; but language is more than logic for those who wish it to be so. Any
speaker or writer who seeks to create poetic speech may require stress,
rhyme, alliteration, metre, cadence, resonance, contrast, variety or
emphasis within a single word. This is why synonyms may be preferred - even
though they all mean practically the same thing. In addition, English is
full of near-synonyms from different languages e.g. "rear/raise,
weak/frail/fragile", which not only give it subtlety, but lower the
"vocabulary barrier" for many nationalities. No other tongue, least of all
among the constructed languages, displays this degree of flexibility. It is
difficult to imagine that any constructed language could be designed with
such a feature - which means that, when people from diverse linguistic
backgrounds use English, they can employ the synonym nearest to the word in
their first language. It might not be quite right; but they will be
understood."

I think this should be thought about before all the current synonyms are
deleted from a "Core"-dictionary, as this theoretical improvement might not
impove thinks in practice.

*   This highlights the whole question of international communication.  Sometimes we have to 'drop' into another national language for clarification.

    I would like to see subsscribers to Glosalist come up with an inspired way of interleaving the odd natlang example, without upsetting the flow of the general argument.

    In this case, English is the missing natlang; I would need something solid against which to compare the Glosa, that has been translated from German.  I am not speaking here of the actual words, because, in a poem, such as _The Wolf_, what needs to be captured is the poet's implied feeling: this is hard to capture when attempting to "reverse engineer' other people's Glosa, which has arrived via German.

*   Yes, this 'aside' marked by a hyphen did the trick.

    I have found in the past that square brackets are generally acceptible for this sort of thing, EG ['skirted' in Eng. Ver.], or if only one alternative language is being mentioned, simply [skirted].

   LONGI [along]

   ALELO [beside]

*   I would not feel that Glosa words were "sacred"; rather I understand them to be derived from current Classical roots, because they best represent a particular concept and its context.  However, I have found it most usful to refer to the Greek and Latin dictionaries, when a difficult question of word usage arises.  I have sought to intuit the surrounding contexts of the various Classical words that have been fed into Glosa.  After doing this sort of dictionary research, I am convinced of the rightness of a particular Glosa derivative for my purpose, or, oppositely, of its unsuitbility.


    When such research leads me to the conclusion that a particular concept has not been covered adequately by the Glosa authors, I look again into the Classical dictionaries, seeking a word tht would be better for my purposes than any existing Glosa word, and one which would not clash with words already in the Glosa dictionary. On such rare occasions I find it convenient to coin a new Glosa word.

An early stage of "parser processing" finds the noun and verb phrases.
Particles like "es" stand to the left of such phrases, and the fuller
semantic words like nouns and verbs stand to the right. The particles
categorize the phrase and tie it to the clause/sentence/paragraph;
"es" being as verby as anything, prepositions and determiners serving
for case (when specified - core cases usually are "licensed" by verbs).
Certain patterns like "u/plu adj ... noun" and "es ... pred.adj"
are what the student learns, without ever really understanding the
irrelevant grammatical details like "what is a noun, really?"

> Whilst I, too, have said that a Glosa parser should be a snack to prepare, I have got a range of resposes,to this assertion, with the worst from LIU Haitao, who said, that because Glosa had no P-o-S markers and no verb inflections it was impossible to create a parser for the language.

No, it's easy. I think it is even very fair to provocatively say that
"Glosa has very little grammar". And what little it has, is a
simplified English. This is still speaking of syntax, only.

A second stage or parsing, where Esperanto/Ido do much better than Glosa,
is morphological. I categorically deny the myth that English has little
morphology; there are according to Skeat far more etymological affixes
than he can ever hope to count. Glosa has only the -bo type, and general
hyphenation-compounding of roots. This is Glosa's 2nd major strength
from the viewpoint of a learner, because morphology is extremely difficult;
but it is also such a powerful technique that Esperanto/Ido can nearly
make a whole language out of it alone, whereas Glosa has no derivational
system at all, nor a large stock of roots ... and suffers expressively.
Anyway, sure makes parsing easy, whether one has a consistent *or*
a nearly absent morphology. English morphology is impossible to parse,
and I've had a lot of "fun" trying to do it.

Let's parse into phrases your clear and idiomatic English sentence there:

"I do suspect that ..."
There's a simple SVO with the O expanding to a relative clause.

"it is a bit ..."
There's a simple predication about to expand into a comparison.

"more complicated than this, ..."
English uses more/less/same/than/as particles as prepositions
to build a coordinated "comparison" structure thingy.

"even as Glosa stands."
OK, here's my point: No matter how you parse this piece,
its connection to the rest of the sentence has a para-syntactic nature.

This is what I consider the true essence o language, a loose coupling
of syntactically vague pieces into a semantically meaningful relation.
Listen to 2 teenage girls in a conversation, stealthily,
and notice that *they do not speak in literary sentences at all*.
Conversation is the real language, not writers' stories.

> one of my reasons for trying to prepare a descriptive grammar of Glosa

I know that, now, from reading the archives of AUXLANG; but it's useless
and impossible to dress up Glosa in a terminology to please such people.
I used to believe that Glosa really needed the POS markers and such,
but have seen that Glosa works simply and well enough with a mere
few particles as syntactic signposts.

The "loose ends" are really not loose at all, they are the honest
trapping of real language in actual use. Don't ever apologize for them,
they are what make it speakable by teenage girls, a much better
demographic target than crusty old dyspeptic grammar mavens.
The best way to kill Glosa would be to make it like Latin,
a deadly bore to the young at heart.

Well, I'll hold off on that for now. I just wanted to say that there
are some unique strengths in Glosa, and that imitating the course
of Ido/Novial/Occidental (which I greatly admire) would be both
foolish and impossible. Glosa should take a different course,
emphasizing celebrating and enhancing its pidgin-like quality.

I think the use of Greek rather than Latin as a vocabulary base
was a mistake by Glosa's designers. Probably you, as a supporter
of Gode's Interlingua, can agree with me on that point.
The portion of Greek that made it into the scientific vocabulary
is certainly useful in any auxlang, however.

> >Glosa has some problems though, in my honest opinion, and

I must admit that I do *not* see Glosa in its current state
as truly finished or usable for much of any purpose, and so
I stand by that statement of mine, though if the world or a large
number of people embrace it as-is, that would be fine with me.
I think Glosa needs a version 3, based on pidgin-creole principles.
I doubt this can ever happen, and I am as satisfied with Occidental
as you are with Interlingua.

(But I feel no need to attack Glosa or try to kill it from within
as a 5th columnist. It was amazing, to see your posts in auxlang
from the year before I joined it. Since there is still such bad blood
between us, I will be ignoring your future postings here, as elsewhere.)

Well, since you expressed interest in my polite words above ...

I would like to see the strongest possible "contender" in
a creole-type of auxlang, hoping it might catch on and if not,
that we might learn from the experience how to do better.
When I first read Lehmann's book on creoles, that area of
linguistic study was just beginning. In 20 years time,
vastly more has been learned. I have posted the URLs to
this and other lists many times, and there are plenty of
Glosa-list archives to examine here ...

A creole syntax devoid of morphology is, everyone now agrees,
the easiest to learn. Creoles also use the easiest phonology.
Syntax can be minimal and it can be spoken in a pidgin form
almost immediately in acceptable fashion. In some cases the
result can be fun and even infectious, as the Tenas Wawa pages
demonstrate for the Chinook Jargon.

Glosa's vocab needs work though. It isn't really as streamlined
or expressive as it needs to be, in order to be taken seriously
by linguists. An auxlang really does need that mark of approval
before it can be acceptable to the public.

I trust that will clarify my current position. I reserve the
right to learn more and change my opinion accordingly at any time.

    Yes, Glosa's simplicity is only syntax-deep.

*   Interesting: I had seen the 'parsing' process as being in two stages
(Syntactic, then Semantic), but you throw in the middle stage, Morphological.

    So that makes Glosa's parsing a three-step operation:-
  Syntactic - fairly standardised, and easy to automate.
  Morphological - very small, and thus easy to cope with.
  Semantic - possibly a minefield, because this is where most of Glosa's
understanding comes from.  It is also the reason most people do not know
how to approach the writing (and speaking) of Glosa, because the raw words
(and associated meanings) do all the work, causing the utterer to compose
their thoughts at the ideational level - instead of letting the morphology
sort out all of the details.

    And this is the mystery: the teenage girls do use a form of syntax that
allows them to make sense of each other's words and - even with heavy
elision, and considerable disregard for morphology - they happily sequence
their semantic elements in relation to this conditioned (or natural) syntax.

*  Wow!
  . Traditional grammar terminology does not seem to satisfy Glosa's need.
  . Interesting re P-o-S: with well-written Glosa, syntax should make word
function clear.
  . Yes, I feel the 'signposts' work, and also think they should be used,
in writing especially, when any possibility of confusion exists.

*   Well, agreed: the elements of Glosa grammar do not comprise any
synthetic add-ons; they simply represent a description of the basic
elements required for an effective communication medium.

It's OK to be a little skeptical ... "es/is" is often called
"the copula" or "an auxiliary"; it certainly isn't just an ordinary
verb like "to throw". In the spirit of Hogben, it may be more correct
to speak of "full words" (general vocabulary) vs. "empty words"
(grammatical particles with relatively little semantic meaning).
It was rather a brave strategy in Glosa to toss out "grammar",
and ultimately I think its main strength. If too much grammatical
complexity creeps back into it, it will please only the wrong crowd.

> Yes, Glosa's simplicity is only syntax-deep.

I think it is the *essence* -- and a good thing. I've mentioned
before, elsewhere, that what seemed to work best for me
in learning to use Occidental was precisely the "analytical"
verb system. Instead of tense endings and suchlike claptrap,
one does much like Glosa. It is the only auxlang I succeeded
in actually using, and liking whole-heartedly, though I also
still admire parts of Glosa and Ido.

Glosa could, if it had a better vocabulary, and if it could
solve the problem of derivation, perhaps go even further.
Many people have suggested that an auxlang designed around
a creole structure should be the ideal auxlang. But every time
another Latin/Romance-based auxlang comes along, it drags in
all the grammatical claptrap that students universally hate ...
which is why Interlingua de Gode sucks so much.

I'd like to see a Glosa version 3.

Exactly what I meant, except I see the minefield more as elysian.
That's just the way language has to be. The other approach,
defining meaning logically, is what we do with logic and algorithms.
I am both a holder of a math degree and a programmer for 20 years,
but the day will never come when people can "speak" logic.

Syntactically, I think they did well. Phonologically,
(I mean being easy to learn to pronounce for most cultures)
they did OK too. Derivation and vocabulary selection, though ...

Yeah, I admit, you convinced me somewhere along the way. Thanks.
Then I experienced that in using Occidental ... the little vowel
POS endings are soon elided, being felt as cumbersome.

Well, as an experiment, if one were to select a random
page in the Interlingua dictionary that is online at
http://www.interlingua.com ... how can Glosa truly handle
translation of the word families presented there?

(Not just find a single cognate root in Glosa to cover
many related but different concepts. Occidental can do it
with a systematic set of affixes, but that is not Glosa's way.)

*
*   I still describe them as "substantives" - used as 'nouns', 'verbs' and
'modifiers' .. having concept meaning; and "function words" - used as
conjunctions, prepositions, negatives, interrogatives, "temporals", and
simple syntax guides .. showing the inter-relations between the concept-words.

    Where the system breaks down - apart from your concern over vocabulary
derivation - is in adding the additional 'flavours' to the substantives.
While Esperanto does this well(?) with inflections, glosa tries hard with:-
  . particles - in front of words  e.g. u, pa.
  . generic terms - two-letter abbreviations of substantives added as
       hyphenated suffixes  e.g. -pe, -do.
  . a rare prefix, to achieve passivity  i.e. ge- .
  . compounding of substantives with one (or more) generics e.g.  hedo-pe
  . compounding between substantives, with hyphen, where there is a
       dominant substantive, which comes last  e.g.  lana-tegu.
  . compounding between substantives, where the resulting concept is a
       meld of component concepts  e.g. u tele-video produce-pe.

    Paul Bartlett suggested the possibility of some other formative
affixes, working similarly to the 'generics', but with possibly four
letters (still abbreviated) and also hyphenated - mainly to act as
suffixes, but also, possibly, as prefixes.  I tend to agree with him; but
there is still some rationalisation of the basic vocabulary still to be
done.  Also, this would be research on Glosa done outside the seminal
centre of Richmond, Surry, and, as such, might represent an unfortunate
contre-temps* with the authors.

*   I feel that your gut reaction, here, is significant.
    You have looked at a number of other auxlangs, analytically, and have
found one that you ..
   % are actually using,
   % whole-heartedly like, and
   & has a style of intuitve verb function;
             .. it must have something going for it!

*   So, it could happen.  Exactly what do you mean by "derivation": are you
speaking of the selection process for the Glosa lexicon; or are you
referring to modification of meaning of the 'verbs'?

Dictionary", I must take up this challenge, and look at Inerlingua's 'word
families'.  However, it would be better for me to look at the equivalent
situation in Occidental, as well, so I could compare and contrast all three
auxlangs, and, hopefully, learn from the experience!

  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run.
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

The particles and lexical compounding seem true to its nature,
but to begin adding affixes again doesn't, to me ... in that case
(the "-pe" and "ge-" types) one might as well opt for Ido's artificial
or Occidental's naturalistic affixes.

The affixations mentioned above. They seem awkward and inadequate to me.
The virtue of Glosa is in its relatively lack of affixation/morphology.

Yes, sorry; I estimate only around half the vocab was well-chosen;
Ido's basic vocabulary is much better (though not "perfect" either).
If 3000 or so roots without affixes were enough for a usable language,
I could learn to like them, but clearly they are not enough, because
the authors haven't a systematic derivational scheme, so they
have to add completely different roots for each shade of meaning.

OCC does not have a good URL for comparison. Basically it uses the
same affixes as Interlingua (plus about 50% more) to extend roots.
The "Radicarium" I have only in paper form; it shows typically:
PRESS-er ... to press. affixes: -e, -ion, com-, ex-, im-, etc

If one likes that sort of naturalistic affixation, then Glosa isn't
going to be able to compete. OCC goes for "at sight recognition"
and immediate comprehensibility, at the cost of needing to know
a significant (maybe 10,000 root) Latinate vocabulary. This works
well for lazy learners like me who already speak English, since Eng
swallowed most of the Latin-Greek roots.

Glosa could be something *different*, a minimal-vocab language
for non-euro-speakers. I imagine: the current syntax, and phonology,
plus a cleaned-up list of 2500 roots, minus all affixation.
Then market it as *the* easiest language to learn for all the world.

*   While I understnd Paul Bartlett's comment concerning synonyms, that people using different synonyms could, for practical purposes, be speaking different languages, I do support the fairly early learning and use of synonyms, for the reason stated by the writer, above.


    It is my belief that a straightened language is best for beginners, but that alternative forms - possibly only one from Greek and one from Latin - should be introduced soon after the learner is fluent with a one-word/one-concept vocabulary.


    I listened to Ron Clark's argument for the Glosa 1000 lexicon - with basically one word for each of Roget's concepts - and did try to learn and use Glosa thus; it gave me the claustrophobic sensation that I was trying to communicate in a fish-bowl.  I kept going round and round bumping into the same words over and over again.

    The word for this suffocating feeling is iteraphobia (= a fear of   repetition, leading to the seeking of synonyms); Dr Johnson once said that on hearing a word go down for the third time, he felt he was drowning.


    As I have said before, the publication of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary enabled me to enjoy writng Glosa, whereas using _Glosa 1000_ left me unsatisfied and iteraphobic.  When we strike the happy medium with a _Glosa 2500_, and I hope this is soon, then we should have a first dictionary that does not restrict the learner's ability to express common concepts.  However, after that, the learner ought to be able to upgrade to a larger dictionary that gives more literary satisfaction.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

   P.S.  While both the term and the historical reference introduced, above, are Gaskell originals, I believe that they did help me to make the point; moreover, I believe my 'poetic licence' permits me to add to the language in this way, as long as it is done artistically.   R.G.

On the other hand, Fowler had a certain contempt for "elegant variation".
And looking at the routine primitiveness of it in much communication, e.g.
the absolute necessity for the newspaper reporter to alternate "the U.N."
and "the world body", I'm on Fowler's side.  It seems an artificial,
self-inflicted need leading to the lowest form of art.

On the main point, which I inadvertently snipped, I have seen a Basic
English passage of considerable beauty.  The complaint made against Basic
seems to be less a sense of being bereft of words wanted for pure
variety, and more a sense of boredom at the incessant circumlocations
needed to express meanings for which single words are not available.

My impression is that limiting the required vocabulary is very important,
that noticing the importance of it was a key advance.

The problem with having ostensibly alternative words is that there are no
exact synonyms.  A particular skill in the idiom is needed to use near
synonyms correctly.  This is the reverse of what is needed for an
international language.  We just do not need complications like that.

In the Ido list recently there was a discussion of the difference between
savar and konocar.  All that was shown was that having both is a problem.
Certainly, by a thorough study of the two words one can learn to use both
correctly to express their separate fine shades of meaning, but what the
hell, a bit of arm waving and explanation would do as well.

Hello Friends,
  This is an administrative request.

  Please use line widths approximately 70 - 75 characters wide.

REASON:
  A message that originally fits the page at 80 characters, ends up with
"curl"
around sentences, after going through one, or two, replies.

  The

of the software.

   Perhaps some psychological complex causes me to see 'untidiness' in
messages that are a series of long and short lines.  However, the cause of
better formatting of messages is served by starting off with shorter
line-lengths, which allow a margin at the right-hand side for growth.

   My thanks go to people who already restrict their line-lengths; my
appreciation goes to those who see the beauty in well-formatted messages.

Gracia and Thanks,

Robin Gaskell


  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run.
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

Sometimes we have to 'drop' into another national language for clarification.
    I would like to see subsscribers to Glosalist come up with an inspired
way of interleaving the odd natlang example, without upsetting the flow of
the general argument.
    In this case, English is the missing natlang; I would need something
solid against which to compare the Glosa, that has been translated from
German.  I am not speaking here of the actual words, because, in a poem,
such as _The Wolf_, what needs to be captured is the poet's implied
feeling: this is hard to capture when attempting to "reverse engineer'
other people's Glosa, which has arrived via German.

*   Yes, this 'aside' marked by a hyphen did the trick.
    I have found in the past that square brackets are generally acceptible
for this sort of thing, EG ['skirted' in Eng. Ver.], or if only one
alternative language is being mentioned, simply [skirted].

* I would run a number of formulations through my  head, seeking the best
match for the poet's intention;
   PERI [around]
   LONGI [along]
   ALELO [beside]
   KI PERI [going around]
   KI LONGI [move(d) along]
   PA KI LONGI [moved along; did move along]

   Unfortunately I cannot attempt a match, because I do not have an
English-language rendition of the poem.  What are the alternative ways
around this communication difficulty?

The Wolf - Hermann Hesse (1907)

Never had there been so cruelly cold and long a winter in the French
mountains. For weeks the air had been clear, crisp and cold. By day the
great slanting snowfields lay dull-white and endless under the glaring
blue sky; by night the moon passed over them, a small, clear, angry
frosty moon, and on the snow its yellowish glare turned a dull blue that
seemed the very essence of coldness. The roads and trails were deserted,
especially the higher ones, and the people sat lazy and grumbling in
the village huts. At night the windows glowed smoky red in the blue
moonlight, and before long they were dark.

It was a hard time for the animals of the region. Many of the smaller
ones, and birds as well, froze to death, and their gaunt corpses fell
prey to the hawks and wolves. But they too suffered cruelly from cold
and hunger. There were only a few wolf families in the region, and their
distress led them to band more closely together. By day they went out
singly. Here and there one of them would dart through the snow, lean,
hungry, and alert, as soundless and furtive as a ghost, his narrow
shadow gliding beside him in the whiteness. He would turn his pointed
muzzle into the wind and sniff, and from time to time let out a dry,
tortured howl. But at night they would all go out together and the
villages would be surrounded by their plaintive howling. Cattle and
poultry were carefully shut up, and guns lay in readiness behind sturdy
shutters. Only seldom were the wolves able to pounce on a dog or other
small prey, and two of the pack had already been shot.

The cold went on and on. Often the wolves huddled together for warmth
and lay still and brooding, listening woefully to the dead countryside
around them, until one of them, tortured by hunger, suddenly jumped up
with a bloodcurdling roar. Then all the others turned their muzzles
toward him and trembled; and all together burst into a terrible,
menacing, dismal howl.

Finally a small part of the pack decided to move. Early in the morning
they left their holes, gathered together, and sniffed anxiously and
excitedly at the frosty air. Then they started off at a quick, even
trot. Those who were staying behind looked after them with wide glassy
eyes, trotted a few steps in their wake, stopped, stood still for a
moment in indecision, and went slowly back to their empty dens.

At noon the traveling party split in two. Three of the wolves turned
eastward toward the Swiss Jura, the others continued southward. The
three were fine strong animals, but dreadfully emaciated. Their indrawn
light-colored bellies were as narrow as straps, their ribs stood
out pitifully on their chests, their mouths were dry and their eyes
distended and desperate. They went deep into the Jura. The second day
they killed a sheep, the third a dog and a foal. On all sides the
infuriated country people began to hunt them. Fear of the unaccustomed
intruders spread through the towns and villages of the region. The mail
sleighs went out armed, no one went from one village to another without
a gun.

After such good pickings, the three wolves felt at once contented and
uncertain in the strange surroundings. Becoming more foolhardy than they
had ever been at home, they broke into a cow barn in broad daylight. The
warm little building was filled with the bellowing of cows, the crashing
of wooden bars, the thudding of hooves, and the hot, hungry breath of
the wolves. But this time people stepped in. A price had been set on the
wolves, and that redoubled the peasants' courage. They killed one with
a gunshot through the neck, the second with an ax. The third escaped
and ran until he fell half-dead in the snow. He was the youngest and
most beautiful of the wolves, a proud beast, strong and graceful. For a
long time he lay panting. Blood-red circles whirled before his eyes, and
at times a painful, wheezing moan escaped him. A hurled ax had struck
him in the back. But he recovered and managed to stand up. Only then
did he see how far he had run. Far and wide there were neither people
nor houses. Ahead of him lay an enormous snow-covered mountain, the
Chasseral. He decided to go around it. Tortured by thirst, he took a few
bites of the frozen hard snow crust.

On the other side of the mountain he spied a village. It was getting
on toward nightfall. He waited in a dense clump of fir trees. Then
he crept cautiously past the garden fences, following the smell of
warm barns. There was no one in the street. Hungrily but fearfully, he
peered between the houses. A shot rang out. He threw his head back and
was about to run when a second shot came. He was hit. On one side his
whitish belly was spotted with blood, which fell steadily in big drops.
In spite of his wound he broke into a bounding run and managed to reach
the wooded mountain. There he stopped for a moment to listen, and heard
voices and steps in the distance. Terror-stricken, he looked up at the
mountainside. It was steep, densely wooded, and hard to climb. But he
had no choice. Panting, he made his way up the steep wall, while below
him a confusion of curses, commands, and lantern lights skirted the
mountain. Trembling, the wounded wolf climbed through the woods in the
half-light, while slowly the brown blood trickled down his flank.

The cold had let up. The sky in the west was hazy, giving promise of snow.

At last the exhausted beast reached the top. He was at the edge of a
large, slightly inclined snowfield not far from Mont Crosin, high above
the village from which he had escaped. He felt no hunger, but a dull
persistent pain from his wound. A low sick bark came from his drooping
jaws, his heart beat heavily and painfully; the hand of death weighed
on it like a heavy load. A lone fir tree with spreading branches lured
him; there he sat down and stared forlornly into the snow-gray night.
Half an hour passed. Then a red, strangely muted light fell on the snow.
With a groan the wolf stood up and turned his beautiful head toward the
light. It was the moon, which, gigantic and blood-red, had risen in the
southeast and was slowly climbing higher in the misty sky. For many
weeks it had not been so big and red. Sadly, the dying wolf's eyes clung
to the hazy disk, and again a faint howl rattled painfully through the
night.

Then came lights and steps. Peasants in thick coats, hunters and boys
in fur caps and clumsy leggings came tramping through the snow. A
triumphant cry went up. They had sighted the dying wolf, two shots were
quickly fired. Both missed. Then they saw that he was already dying and
fell upon him with sticks and clubs. He felt nothing more.

Having broken his bones, they dragged him down to Saint-Immer. They
laughed, they boasted, they sang, they cursed; they were looking forward

different things.
    How many of the rest of humanity can recognise the "hyphen" concept?  I
know that Paul Bartlett hates it, and says that people cannot HEAR a hyphen.

    Were I to utter a discrete hyphen, no-one woulld hear it, unless we
forced it to carry a "schwa."  Using English-language pronunciation, the
"a-pe" would sound very different from an "ape" spelling.
    However, using Glosa syntax and pronunciation rules, the Glosa hyphen
can be '''heard''' by the butting together of two words (or word and
affixed particle): there is an audible 'gap' between the two parts!

    With Glosa stress on the penultimate syllable (or last syllable, if the
word/particle comprises only a single), then, using capital letters to show
the stressed syllable, we contrast:-
   GLOsa-PE   cf   gloSApe
   LAna-TEgu  cf   lanaTEgu

    Do people hate the terminal category affixes?
    They seem to go in English, though with no hyphen, EG
   fast     faster    fasten
   bake     baker     baked  
   post     postman   postbox
   water    waterway  waterwash

    So, although you have a case, in keeping the words and particles
discrete .. by banning hyphens, I feel that they are a handy, and
humanly-acceptable device for separating lexical units within a semantic
whole.

    I will agree that the ~ge-~ prefix is a little bit forced, even though
the authors refer us to the use of something very similar in German.
Actually, at the start, the Glosa authors decreed that all Glosa utterances
would be in the Active Voice.  So the Passive Voice, in Glosa is a recent
addition to the language.  The syntactic model is from English, with the
~ge-~ equivalent to the "ed" or "en."

   He is hit(ted) by Fred.      Fred hits him.
   An gene ge-bate ex Fred.   Fred bate an.

parts are separated by hyphens, are an acceptible form, in which the parts
can be immediately determined by inspection.  Again, in spoken Glosa, the
use of stress readily informs us of the number of parts in a compound.
    I could be shouted down by Linguists, who say that particles attached
by hyphens are affixes; and words compounded using hyphens are simply cases
of morphological change to 'the' word.  However, if the hyphen exists, and
hyphenation has linguistic meaning, then why not use it .. if people can
recognise its existence (visually and through spoken stress), and are happy
with its use.

*   Yes, the question of vocab selection gets back to the foundation of the
language .. and Dictionary production.  I almost feel that to alter a
significant proportion of Glosa's vocabulary, one would be creating
virtually a different language.
    And this comes down to the question of the user-base: who has the
present dictionaries of the language, and what would be involved in
physically replacing these with upgraded versions, IE a Glosa Ver3.

    While, theoretically, a better-designed language could result from
lexical reform, what would be the criteria for the selection of a superior
vocabulasry, and who would choose these criteria.  Were such a project to
be embarked upon, it would take at least another five years - even with the
aid of computers and database programs - and who would do the work?  The
resulting product would probably have to have a distinctive and unique
name: I favour "Lex."  It would not be Glosa, though it might be described
as another derivation of Hogben's Interglossa.
     I cannot volunteer to lead such a project for a number of reasons:
 . age (63),
 . more pressing interests (anti-globalisation, post-capitalism, 2012),
 . loyalty to the Glosa authors,
 . exhaustion at the thought of attempting to work up a user-base - again,
 . a need to concentrate on my survival in retirement.

     However, there is still the thought of the Glosa 2500 project, which I
could be reactivated into - without conflict with any of the above points.
I must ask Bill Patterson where he is up to in Glosa vocabulary reform
process.  The Glosa 2.5K lexicon was supposed to be a streamlined vocab
with virtually no synonyms, additional words - oversights from the original
list, and the selection of the most suitable words where a range of
alternatives had found their way into Glosa.

Juncture and tone are both present in most/all languages.
The hyphen is a very good typographical convention
(whereas the Glosa semicolon is insupportable).

If the Greek style of compounding is used (e.g. hydro-plane)
then I see no need for any suffixes in Glosa. The whole idea was
to rid the IAL of confusing morphology, as in pidgin/creoles.

One must distinguish the "inflectional" from the "derivational".
The fast-en suffix is inflectional/grammatical, whereas
the water-way compound is derivational/semantic. I would
reject the one (in Glosa) and accept the other. Then you can
say "Glosa has no morphology, and the easiest grammar".

Interesting. Well, 2 voices seem reasonable.
Plus the "self" pronoun/particle for reflexive.

I think you are right and Paul was wrong on this point - er, dash.

>     I could be shouted down by Linguists,

Who cares about pedants?  Linguists love all languages equally
and say none are better or worse, which is plain silly: I've made
lots of provably worse conlangs myself. So some are better.
Glosa could be made a far better IAL than it is now.

A new vocabulary would be Latin-based, most likely.
I think the current Glosa fans prefer Greek.
So instead of a new language, a better approach
might be to evolve the current one by simply adding
whatever Greek roots seem necessary, using as much
as possible of the current "inadequate" set.

I would avoid the -pe affixes and use only root compounding
via the infamous hyphen. Added roots should use the CVCV pattern,
and be recognizable (unmangled) to those who know a little Greek.
As for the terminal vowel, I guess it doesn't matter, especially
since it is unstressed.

Nor I. Just dreaming, here.

Great idea. I suggest using anything else but M$ Outlook
as an email reader, lest a virus hits again ...
I've run Linux since 1996 and never a crash or loss yet.

I worry about politics, but never concede defeat to it ...
Make a better language and it can help save the world.
Now, how does the Glosa vocabulary handle this semantic field?

Chinese has relative clauses on the opposite side,
but otherwise fits English/Glosa syntax pretty well.
Anyway, the goal is to overcome such dominance ...

   This form will do for both singular and plural, where the usage is

   To avoid possible reading of ~proto dice~ as "first speaking", it is
better to include the !missing! 'noun': while using ~parti~ might offend
through repetition, the use of ~mero~ [part, piece] provides both the
'noun', which ~proto~ modifies, and the variety required by style.
   I'd say that the use of ~;~ is worthwhile to indicate the start of a new
clause.  Some find the ~;~ ugly, and prefer the ~,~ which is a common
clause delimiter in English.  The Glosa authors decreed _;_ for the start
of a new clause, and _,_ where necessary to indicate the start of a new
phrase. 
   Because of Glosa's syntax-based grammar, in which there are no
Part-of-Speech markers, the punctuation assumes grammatical significance ..
providing automatic disambiguation of written script.  In the spoken form,
alternatively, pause and vocal inflection indicate sentence structure to
the listener.

>    Po-co textu habe no komika, sed ma faktu-info.  
*    Po-co, u textu habe objecti, e habe ma faktu info.
 [after that, the text is objective, and has more factual information]
  
   The _,_ ensures that we do not read the ~po-co~ as modifying the
~textu~.  The ~u~ ensures that we know the word before the 'verb' ~habe~
must be a 'noun'. 
   ~habe objecti~ could be translated as "has objectiveness", but obviously
we use the more usual "is objective".
   I feel that ~e~ is more logical than ~sed~ in this construction.
   ~faktu info~ is a modifier/'noun' pair and calls for no hyphen.  The
hyphen, which is used to form compounds, usually joins words of equivalent
function, eg NOUN-NOUN: ~soni-info~ [information as sound]
   ~ma faktu info~ is a standard NOUN phrase (comparative-modifier-NOUN).

>* Major-pagina ne du habe info de hetero plu auxi-lingua.  
*  U major-pagina ne habe info de plu hetero auxi-lingua.
[the main page (does) not have information about the other auxiliary
languages]
   
   In this case, it just flows better for me with the less abrupt ~U
major-pagina~.  It is not _wrong_ without the ~U~.
   Using the continuous tense does not apply here: ~ne du habe~ [= is not
having].
   ~de~ starts a Prepositional Phrase, which is structurally a Noun Phrase.
 In Noun Phrases there is a fairly standard sequence for the elements:-
    Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifier(s) -'noun'
 eg    plu          tri         hetero       Latino     auxi-lingua

> U lekto-pe debi koncentra pro Glosa. 
*  U lekto-pe debi koncentra * de Glosa.
  [the reader ought (to) concentrate * <about> Glosa]

   This is an easy construction in English, and we could use ~epi~ which
would be the translation of an English usage: ~de~ is the 'general- 
purpose' Glosa preposition, and this is probably the right word to use.
   The _*_ marks a missing, hidden NOUN.  We are not concentrating Glosa,
nor are we just concentrating about Glosa, we are, in fact, concentrating
_something_ on Glosa.  
   U lekto-pe debi koncentra an menta a Glosa.
  [the reader should concentrate his mind towards Glosa]
  ~pro~ would possibly be equally as good here.

> U-ci info pa gene loki in hetero datu-fa (gfaq.htm).  
* Un info de plu hetero auxi-lingua, pa gene loka intra u hetero datu-fa

   I found that the earlier statement was so far from ~U-ci~ that the link
was not still there.
   ~intra u hetero~ seemed necessary here = "inside an-other"

Dear Glosa friends,

  I am sorry you haven't received "Plu Glosa Nota" for a while.  The 
reason for the pause is that Ron Clark died.  He suffered a heart 
attack last year, and sadly a second attack this month was fatal.  

  Ron's energy and enthusiasm for Glosa never waned and in spite of 
suffering short term memory loss during the past few months he 
continued to work and answer some of the letters.  

  I am not yet sure what Glosa publications and activities will be 
planned for the future.  I will write again later in the year.  
Meanwhile I know many of you in various countries are enjoying 
communicating via letter or e-mail to spread and use Glosa.  I do not 
have e-mail at the moment, the above address remains in use. 

  Thank you for your support and for the letters, translations and 
ideas which you send.

  Best wishes 
    Wendy Ashby
"

From: Robin Gaskell <rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au>
Date: Wed, 05 Jul 2000 01:07:19 +1000

To All at Glosalist and Auxlang,

  Sad news.

  I just received news that Ronald Clark, who had a heart attack last year,
died of a second recently.

  A light in this darkness has been extinguished.

  Now, Wendy Ashby, currently without a Net connection, must decide how,
and if, she will continue the work of promoting Glosa without Ron.  She
needs all the support she can get, and letters of condolence can be sent to
    Wendy Ashby
    PO Box 18, Richmond
    Surry  TW9 1WD
    U. K.

  Ron wished to make a difference to the world, in showing that a Common
Second Language works and is already within our grasp.  I believe he did
leave his mark on history, and also that his "Glosa" is a world class
Auxiliary Language.  Ron Clark will be remembered, but a question mark
hangs over the social invention that he wished to give to the world.
  Will Glosa become a major component of the Better World we all seek?
  Through renewed effort, those who value the language, and share Ron's
dream for a Communicating World, will work with Wendy to create a new
chapter in the Glosa saga.

  Ave Ronald.

Robin Gaskell

*   Dear Alexander,

    Thank you for your e-mail.  This IS the right question.  Unfortunately, I do not have a completely satisfactory answer.


ANSWER:

 1. My URL  www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell  has a lot of stuff on it, but no

instruction book, as such.

 2. I will send by separate message a Redirected message carrying other URLs for Glosa.

 3. As an attachment to this e-mail, I add the "Glosa Classified" file;

this has words grouped into collections with similar function.  It is an old file with some out-of-date addresses.

 4. I offer to send you a printed copy of "18 Steps to Euro-Glosa", which is a very basic introductory instruction book, written by the Glosa authors - please send your land address if you would like this.

 5. I will send an IBM 3.5 inch floppy disk with various Glosa files on it, if you would like it - again, land address needed.

 6. There is one cassette that I have made up using spoken Glosa together with printed Glosa/English sheets.  I would rather send this as a sale item: cost = replacement cost of blank cassette; minimum payment an Australian $5 note from a Russian bank; but if this is not possible, FREE.


 #7. I have been planning, for some time, to prepare a Glosa instruction course based on a successful English-language course, that uses cassette

instruction.  Your request might signal the need for me to start this project.  If you are interested in Alpha-testing such a course, I would treat you as a part author in the project; the cost of postage of materials, to you, would be bourne by me.



  So, I welcome your request, and it could stimulate me to action.  Setting up a cassette-based instruction course for Glosa is well overdue.

  It would, however be paper/cassette based and rely on normal postage for distribution.

  In theory, a suitable introductory instruction course shuld be available through the Internet: I will have to think about this!


Bien-venu a Glosa. Saluta,

[Welcome to Glosa. Greetings.]

                        INTRODUCTION

        * During the past 2 centuries Scientists have created a
world-wide technical Vocabulary.  As Modern Technology transforms
everyday life what was once the Vocabulary of the Laboratory becomes the
Vocabulary of the Street Corner.

        * Glosa has no grammer.  About 20 particles do all the work of
Tense, Number, Comparison, etc.

        * Below Glosa 1000 is divided into useful categories.

        * It is important to understand that this is no mere `get-by'
language, but a complete language able to deal with any theme as
demonstrated in the periodical PGN, Plu Glosa Nota.

        * Glosa words suffer no inflexion.  You take them straight from
the Dictionary and put them into sentences.

        * Glosa is a semantically based language. i.e. a group of words
which share a common element of meaning should show this in their form.
For example, an aviary, library, cattle-shed, theatre, stable, and
church, and many others all have a common element, in that they are all
buildings.  The Greek and Latin for a building contains the root DOM- as
in DOMestic, DOMIcile.  In Glosa any building ends with the generic -DO a
shorter form of DOMI.  In Glosa a library is a BIBLI-DO, a book-house, a
theatre a DRAMA-DO.  These Generics are listed below and enable you to
build up a very large vocabulary without having to memorize a great
number of words.
        Similarly, opposites in Glosa are formed by pre-positing NO- or
NON- before a vowel.  Thus ALTI, high as in ALTItude can be brought down
in NON-ALTI, low.

        * It is important to understand that each CONCEPT word stands for
an idea, and so corresponds somewhat to a Head-Word in Roget's Thesaurus,
standing for a great number of English words sharing the same idea.
Context gives precision.  The IndoEuropean languages all have far too
many homosemes, words meaning roughly the same.  This puts a great load
on the memory of a student; and this mistake is not repeated in Glosa.

        * All words in a Glosa Dictionary are to be found in any good
English Dictionary such as OED or Websters.  They also of course occur in
all other Euro-Dictionaries, French, German, and Russian, and outside
Europe in most oriental dictionaries such as Japanese and Malaysian.

Dear Robin!

cost = replacement cost of blank cassette; minimum payment an Australian $5
note from a Russian bank; but if this is not possible, FREE.
Thank you, but In the biggest Russian banks my family lost almost all our
money, and now I lay out all my pocket-money for Internet, so If you cannot
send the casset for Free I can do without it, and In the future, when I will
work (In some years), I'll buy It

>#7. I have been planning, for some time, to prepare a Glosa instruction

you as a part author in the project; the cost of postage of materials, to
you, would be bourne by me.
I want to be Alpha-Tester, but I cannot understand the wort bourne, I found
that It is 3rd form of verb bear, but my Dictionary know only noun "bear".
Please find the synonym.
Alex.

dear Robin
have been thinking about a Latin/Glosa dic for a while. Instead of sending
word lists in umpteen different languages, we could use Latin as most
european people could get hold of a latin/own tongue without too much bother
and could move from own to latin to glosa. I suggest that this applies only
to G1000..... and that further dictionaries would have G8004 etc defined in
G1000. I did start one so I'll try to rake it up. I think G1000 is perhaps a
bit restricting although the idea is good and we might perhaps aim for
something like G3000. There seems to be a site about dictionaries but I
haven't dabbled yet. If someone has already done something in latin I'd be
interested.
have communicated with alexander - more to follow

So many of the roots are already Latin, Syd!?

But if you want a glossary with a lot of
international Latin roots visit my dictionary
pages at
http://adam.cheshire.net/~jjbowks/iglos/
They're all in ascii format and you may
edit to your heart's content :-)

fairly new recruit) so that I could send diagrams/illustrations about some
stuff I'm doing in Glosa, I presume you got a picture of a fist! (not meant
to be agressive). It was a random choice.
The shape was part of the letter "g" in fingertalk which is something I'm
working up to help poor blokes like me who are slightly deaf but hopeless at
lip-reading even after about 6 or 7 years at it.
I'm interested in alphabets and so on so I'd like to hear more.
saluta.....

thanks again" some are and some are greek - problem there for my purpose is
the alphabet.
I'm trying to get together or find a glosa/latin dictionary so that one would

Ameslan is American Sign Language.
I'm one of the two translators at our Kingdom
Hall on Sundays that helps out our deaf friends
enjoy the program.

The fingerspelling alphabet used in Ameslan
goes back many centuries and is based on
French and Spanish monks who used it
to communicate as they had taken a vow of
silence, imagine that, and now deaf people
all over the United States use this manual
alphabet to fingerspell.

I have a couple of fonts for windows which
you can use in any windows wordprocessor
to spell out things with hands on your screen.
It's pretty neat stuff. I've also used the signs
to teach Spanish pronunciation to my students.

If you'd like the fonts I'll email them to you
privately on a message, so as not to get the list
on a tangent :-)

Since,
Jay B.

Hi Alexander and other Glosalist-pe,

  Alexander your Glosa is understandable, and will get into proper form (syntax) as you go along.

  You are using the ^jump into the deep end of the pool^ method of learning Glosa.  And this is possibly the most valid ways of adding Glosa to your thinking.

1. ~Mi pa du vi URLs.~   ... "VERB" missing: vide = (to) see

Essential:-

a. ~Mi pa du vide vi URL.~

   [I did continue to see your(<<- plural) URL]

    I have been seeing your URL.

Alternative:-

a'. ~Mi pa vide tu plu URL.~

    [I di see your(<<- singular) (more than one)URL]

     I saw your URLs.

    >> This corrects for number, and puts the action out of continuous tense and into the simple past. <<<<


2. ~Na du mi trenta gene sko u lingua.~   ... spelling corrections

Essential:-

b.  ~Nu mi du tenta gene sko u lingua.~

    [now I continue to try to learn the language]

     Now I am trying to learn the language.

Possible:-

b'. ~Nu mi tenta gene sko de u lingua.~

    [now I try  to get learning of the language]

     Now I (will) try to learn the language.


3. ~Qe mi Glosa es veri?   ... concept-word selection: veri = (to be) true

   [question: my Glosa is true]

    Is my Glosa true?

Better:-

c'. ~Qe, mi Glosa habe korekti?~

    [(does) my Glosa have correctness]

     Is my Glosa correct?


  So, there you go Alexander.  This is quite a good effort for starting on a new language.

Overall Hints:

  ! Aim to 'think in Glosa' as soon as possible.

  @ As a "concept language" you can ask yourself:

      * is this the right word to convey my idea?

      * am I translating an idiom from a national language?

  # Check for "feel"; when you read yor sentence out loud:

      * does it bring your originally intended meaning back into mind?

      * does the srtring of words sound pleasant?

      * is the written sentence appealing to the eye?

         % If the answer to any of these questions is, "NO", then it is

             probably better to recast the sentence.


  By the way, I am happy that you have discovered Glosa, and that you are

checking the language out through practicing it.

  As your Glosa fluency improves, I will ask how you compare expressing yourself in Russian and in Glosa.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

Very interested idea,syd, but:
1. Latin has very hard grammar and orthography, and maybe necessary a "Other
artificial language"-Glosa dic? I have seen in Internet Ido-Glosa
dictionary, but Ido is not most popular artificial language in the world.
In the future after Russian/glosa I want make Esperanto-Glosa.
2. All Europeans can understand the meaning of any Latin sentence, but also
all Europeans can understand the meaning of any Glosa sentence.
But you right for regional Glosa dictionaries necessary the Basic
dictionary, because English has many homonyms. And translating of dictionary
is difficult.
Alex.
p.s. maybe in the letter my English is bad,  I am sorry, I hadn't time for
this letter.

I made the Ido-Glosa comparison, to demonstrate/discover
that their basic roots are quite similar. It is at:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/idoglosa.htm

I think the idea of a multi-lingual dictionary is good.
Occidental and Novial both have such dictionaries
(really they are just fancy word lists) but neither
is on the web in a complete state. See:
http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/novial/nl.html

I have made many such word lists by combining others
found on the web. Here is a sample, words beginning
in "but..." in English, Glosa, Ido, and Lingua Franca:

glo     buta            eng     purpose
glo     butalis         eng     nightingale
eng     butcher         glo     macela
eng     butcher         glo     trucido
lf      butia           eng     bottle
ido     butik           eng     shop, store, boutique
glo     butina          eng     booty
glo     butiro          eng     butter
ido     buton           eng     button
glo     butona          eng     button
ido     butr            eng     butter
eng     butter          glo     butiro
eng     butter          ido     butr
eng     butter          lf      mantega
eng     buttercup       glo     ranunkulus
eng     butterfly       glo     lepidoptera
eng     butterfly       glo     papilio
eng     butterfly       ido     papilion
eng     buttocks        glo     pigi
eng     buttocks, rump  glo     glutea
eng     button          glo     butona
eng     button          ido     buton
eng     button          lf      botone

I think such lists are useful in designing an auxlang to
avoid "false friends" and pick tuly international words.
So, I think adding Latin and Greek equivalents would be
a very useful thing to do.

Taking as an example "butterfly", there are at least
two other good international words other than Glosa's
scientific choice "lepidoptera": "mariposa" and "papilion".
I have come to think this is unavoidable and OK; it does
increase the vocabulary so it is more difficult to learn.

But it is more honest and Glosa has done a good thing by
classifying words into categories, something that only
the Lingua Franca Nova auxlang has emulated or pioneered:
http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/lfnintro.html

I would propose that we do something like this:
make a 3-column list in several languages.
When multiple words are equivalent, list each
on a separate line, so that a sorted list
is easier to use, and columns are kept narrow.
There should be 50 to 100 different "categories".

category    Glosa          English
==========  =============  ===========
animal	    lepidoptera    butterfly
clothing    butona         button
occupation  macela         butcher
occupation  trucido        butcher

Then, such lists could be merged/combined by a program
to make customized lists, such as Glosa/English/Russian
or Glosa/French/Latin or Glosa/Ido/Novial/Latin/Greek,
posted on the web, and frequently corrected and updated
by all who wish to contribute their efforts. There are
some web-updated multi-lingual dictionaries already,
but not for auxlangs, and they are not systematic.

*  Okay folks,
   Finger/hand/sign language is not something I had thought of up 'til now,
in relation to Glosa.
   Did Ron and Wendy publish a particular set of hand signs?
   I can't recall seeing it.

   In the back of the Sydney phone directory there is a page headed,
_Learning to communicate with the deaf_, and it uses the same set of hand
signs that I learnt as a boy, and that my brother suggested for army use
(with telescopes), when radio communcation failed.
In it:
  G - Right fist hitting onto Left fist.
  N - Index and Middle fingers of Right hand on open palm of Left hand.

   So, a set of hand signs exists; in fact, a series of sets of hand signs
exists, and I have the sensation of ^going down for the third time^ ...

   Will the selection of the best/most-suitable/most-well-known set of hand
signs, for use with Glosa, be as much of a problem as the selection of the
IAL, from among the different languages?

   Would someone please put me in the picture.  Thanks.

   Soon I will have a Hewlett-Packard 5200 Scanner, then I will be able to
copy the page from my phone directory, and include it as a  .JPG  attachment.

   However, the question of finalising a 2500-word learning dictionary for
Glosa is considerably higher up my priority list.  The work, to date, sits
in floppy disks atop my computer waiting for me to make time to do it.

Saluta,
  Robin

   Are you using an English:Russian dictionary, or one that is entirely in

the separate parts of a word come from and what they mean] EG
      television: (tele Gr.=far; visio L.= seeing)?
   Concerning the posting of Cassettes, it will probably be a largely
one-way traffic: from me to you.  However, you can give feedbck, comments
and criticism over the Net.

*   Alexander added that Glosa, like Latin would act as a rough
communication medium for Europeans who knew only their Euro-language.
    And both Jay and Charles have been working on translating lists to
allow translation between Euro-languages and Auxiliary languages.

    It has long been my thought that Glosa, or an abbreviated sub-set of
it, would function, quite well, as a META-language for information booths
at international events .. like the coming Sydney Olympic Games.  But don't
worry, I have not approached the organising committee with any such
suggestions.

    But, for me, such do-gooding ideas are far in the future, considering
how long it is taking just to make headway with the Language, Glosa, on its
own.  I have no time to go off at tangents, at present.  Basically I am
working hard at the political level to prevent Australia from suffering a
fate, similar to the one that Alexander reports, as having befallen him in
Russia.

*   Agreed, to avoid unwanted homophones, this is a good idea.
    Sorting through dictionaries to find "commonality" was something that
Ron Clark was doing - selecting Glosa vocabulary - in 1977, when I met him.
    So, long prior to my joining discussion on the Net, I had already
assumed that the sorting work had all been done.  It was only when I
''reversed'' the Glosa 6000 dictionary (converting the Gl.-->Eng. list to
one showing Eng.-->Gl.), that I found Ron and Wendy had included many
unnecessary Classical synonyms, mainly Greek ones.
    Had the situation not gone beyond one Glosa word from the Greek, and
one derived from Latin, for single English words, I could have coped.
  EG water:  hidra G., aqa L.

*   This to me is a clear-cut case, and not one where fashion, or word
frequency, plays a part in the selection of the Glosa word.
    In my introduction to Glosa, I was told that it was a language for
science, and I still feel this to be fundamentally so.  Some centuries ago
scientists chose "Lepioptera" as the group name for butterflies, and it
would seem counter-productive to suggest breaking this Glosa/science
association now: I know that ~lepidoptera~ is longer, and less melodious,
than ~papilio~; and, though both words are in _Glosa 60000_, I still see
the scientific name as the prime word, with ~papilio~ as the synonym
available for stylistic and poetic purposes.

*   Yes this was a neat idea: I feel that Ron could see people were having
trouble in letter-writing, having to sort through the dictionary,
alphabetically, for every word.  The grouping of the various categories of
function words was, I feel, a particularly smart move.

*   However, to do this for every Glosa word would, I suspect, be
unnecessary, sometimes misleading, and possibly restrictive.
    Where homonyms occur, in either Glosa or English, I would see such
function/category statements as useful,  EG

*   In the days of Early Glosa, Ron Clark (c. 1979) did form a multi

I think you would accomplish much more with Glosa than politics.
Many people are working on the one, very few on the other.
Glosa now is threatened with extinction as a credible auxlang.

Local politics are irrelevant, only global economics matters.
Building a networked community that is international but
non-corporate and non-governmental, would be a possible solution.
The politics of opposition only result in deadlock or worse.

We need clever technological solutions that bypass the
politicians. We need to be active and do the work ourselves.
So, I say we should organize the world's first (or best)
multilingual auxlang vocabulary according to semantic fields.

A simple list cannot be learned at all by 99% of people, and a
fat fake dictionary like Gode's Interlingua cannot even be read.
Look at LFN's scheme and imagine how that could be improved:
http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/lfnvocab.html

I have made experimental web pages with forms with pull-down menus,
one for each semantic field. This could become a 1-page active
reference-thing in a way similar to that of Ogden's Basic English,
but containing thousands rather than hundreds of items.

It requires some time and energy and creativity and enthusiasm.
Or else, just let Glosa die with its authors. Sometimes a bad idea
blocks the path of good, like Esperanto did to better auxlangs.
If the few remaining Glosa leaders won't lead, followers must look
elsewhere. The idea of morphologically simple creolistic grammar
is good, but a senile/moribund Glosa can only block progress.

Esperanto does *not* look similar, Ido does because much work
was done to make the roots naturalistic. Glosa departed from
recognizable roots in the direction of phonetic spelling
and easier pronunciation for non-Europeans. So I expected
far less similarity than I found.

The dictionary needs some work. Who will do it?
The language needs some leaders. Who will lead?
Today it is easier to organize vocabulary material,
and to communicate internationally and quickly.
Here is the ideal project to build the community
of users and new leaders.

That is a false and hopeless direction.
Scientists use Greek roots non-systematically,
simply to generate near-meaningless random names.
The only true language of science is mathematics.
Greek is not useful for an auxlang, Latin is best;
only the Latinized Greek bits are any good.
Hogben was wrong on this point, and times changed.

> though both words are in _Glosa 60000_, I still see

Nobody will ever say "lepidoptera" in real life.
Too long, too formal, too silly. But I now suggest that
instead of removing any words, better ones be added.
After a fair sample of actually-used Glosa writings
from at least 100 users are accumulated, *then* notice
which terms are most popular and mark them in BOLD TYPE.
Let the ugly words die of disuse. Let people generate
lots of Glosa dictionaries. Make a controversy, see
if anyone *cares*, let evolution decide the winners.

I have changed my opinion on restrictiveness. Inclusiveness

English bare/bear/born/etc is unsatisfactory.
By cutting Glosa words too short, similar problems arise.
But long words like lepidopteras won't fly either.

A community of users can solve all these problems in practice.

What you're talking about Robin is the
two handed English system. The Ameslan
system, or Manual Alphabet system uses
one handed signs. Not that this has anything
to do with Glosa, but... it is interesting to
note that there is no international manual
alphabet of sorts. que no?

Hey Jay, I wish I could tell you more about it, but my deaf cousin Anne (who has
some limited auditory capacity yet prefers to use signing for direct
participation in the Deaf community, which she identifies with primarily in
spite of her option to "pass" as an " moderately impaired normal," and more
power to her!) is a natural at learning languages, but they are all sign
languages (A-ha! - what's the neurolgy behind _that_, I wonder? - same
as/different from mental processes of gifted spoken or written language
prodigies?) has told me about an "Interlingua" of signed languages she is
evangelizing for, that is based (like Interlingua) on signs and gestural syntax
patterns common to the largest Deaf communities globally (insofar as it is
possible) and named - at last! - its name at last! - "Gestuno" - a clever
coinage, si? - but that's as much as I know about it.  It seems to be fairly
contemporary in the sense that it has inspired a "cult" of sorts, that has
access to books with the signs the hybrid system uses, which supports a network
of practicioners in the Americas (at least) who maintain written contacts with
one another (online and intermittent newsletters,) as of last summer in any
case, when I learned of it from her.  Maybe further info can be gleaned by a
search engine poke at the embers ... I would have followed up on it myself, but
as usual my plate is 'way too full!  Happy hunting, if you are so inclined, and
until next time, keep the faith with your Interlingua site and email list! -
With best regards, Joseph Carson

I saw the Gestuno book in a library once some years ago, but there were only about
1000 signs if I remember right.

The Gestuno alphabet is just like the American one, hence:
http://where.com/scott.net/asl/abc.html

An alphabet for signed Esperanto seems to exist at: http://abc.signuno.com


(BTW, although interesting, I don't think talk of sign is in the scope of this Glosa
list.)

I think that auxlangs must have own answer on the question: Why I must learn
the language? For example:
Esperanto: Has many adepts in all over the world.
Interlingua: If you want learn any European language, you should learn
Interlingua.
Loglan: You can test Sapir-Worrf hypnotise. And your world view  without
restrictions of your native language.
And Glosa: ????????????????????
If we don't find the answer our language has not chance in the future IAL's
committee.

Glosa claims to have no inflexions.  Isn't 'ge-' a past participle
prefix as in German?  Isn't such a prefix an inflexion?

Middle English had this inflexion (actually y- or i-, e.g. "Sumer
is i-cumen in", where there is a past participle prefix and a past
participle suffix as in "gekommen").

Since all germanic languages except the notoriously primitive
modern German have abandoned it it's queer to see it return in
an IAL.  Why is such a strangely reactionary inflexion
needed?  Is there an alternative, i.e. can it be dispensed with?

Look at "plu".  It says, the following word is plural.  If we would
write it with an hyphen ("plu-feli" instead of "plu feli"), then we
have another prefix/inflexion.  You do not want "ge-"?  Take "ge "!

The "no-inflexions-no-grammar"-purism is important to those who want
mainly a curiosity ("Oh, a language without inflexions. How
bizarre!").  Glosa's destination must be higher.

Anyway, primitive is *good* for a 2nd language!

Imagine an auxlang based on Germanic roots rather
than the notoriously boring Greek and Latin.
English/Afrikaans syntax, sorta like Glosa.

German was too innovative in the area of sound changes
from the earlier common Germanic. Let's reverse the English
sound changes (i.e. use instead some kinda Scottish),
and use the spelling system of the 1600s.

All Nouns must be capitalized, and the final "silent" -e
Grapheme must be pronounced as it was before, as a Schwa.
We should also reinstate the Saxon's Plural since it fits
so well into the adj-noun Order of Things.

Since the Vowels do not mean much of Anything, as in
Gode's Interlingua, we will have no Need to terminate
every Word with a silly romantic Vowel.

As for modern Terminology, we simply adopt all
such Terms as they are used today in Iceland.
As for its Name, it should give an Impression
of reformed hypermodern retro-English.

Sounds like a Winner!

I usually don't post here because I have let my Glosa get so rusty it's
useless and probably won't get better until someone makes a hard copy
dictionary.  But I have to ask: since when do we judge languages are
"primative?"  Primative by what standard?

This is obvious ethnocentricism.  Makes me sad.

You must be joking otherwise what doesn't amount
to much of anything is this thread.

Bruce Gilson can tell you about some Germanic
Auxlangs. I for one don't see the internationality
of going North Germanic, sounds an awful lot
like the WeDe (Welt Deutsch) of the Nazis.

You misunderstand me.  I didn't say it was bad, but that it hadn't
evolved.  Like Icelandic (which presumably also retains the past
participle prefix) it has avoided the evolution that has
simplified the grammar of English, Dutch and the Skandinavian
languages.

It has cases/declensions, conjugations, grammatical gender and
other trappings of an ancient language.  Such languages, because
of their grammatical complexity, are difficult to learn.  Charles
is obviously joking when he says primitive is good in a 2nd
language.

Still, I didn't mean 'primitive' in a pejorative sense.  I was
asking why Glosa or any modern IAL would revive a particle which
disappeared 600 years ago from the inventors' language.

It is amazingly easy to write things that seem clear as to attitude,
which are then misunderstood and lead to argument. Maybe we need
to use "attitudinal" particles as in Lojban. But I find them
as distasteful as smileys :(

You correctly identified my attempt at humor, but I was also
refering to the difficulty most adults experience learning a language.
So I hijack the word "primitive" to mean "cleverly simple",
as in Lingua Franca or Chinook Jargon or etc.

Glosa has adopted a creole style of syntax, which Occidental's
author also saw as the syntax of the future (though he did not
think it acceptable to eurolang-speakers of his time).

I agree that the fewer complications, the better the language.
Glosa's set of "-bo" "-pe" etc suffixes offend me.
Perhaps it would be better simply not to use them?

That might be the beginning of a response to Alexander
E. Kirpichev, whose question remains unanswered: what is the
distinctive advantage of Glosa compared with other IALs, and why
is it worthwhile to learn it?

I too would be interested in a complete answer.  In "The Loom of
Language", Bodmer/Hogben claim that all planned languages up to
Novial (the latest, to them) are distinctly inferior to English as
an IAL, but that one distinctly better than English is possible,
and, it is hinted, is coming.

On the first point, their arguments and language, when discussing
particular IALs, do not inspire enormous confidence in their
intellectual integrity.  Or maybe I should just say, the debunking
sometimes misses its mark or is thin and dubious, and cumulatively
the treatment makes one suspect that a covert advocacy is going
on.

On the second, Interglossa is a failed language, abandoned by
Hogben.  This suggests that it was not a decisive improvement over
its predecessors.  Was it, or is Glosa, such at distinct
improvement as to make good the second part of the claim?  If so,
how?

I have tried them all. They are all too hard to learn but one,
and that one may vary for each person. Language is inherently
and inescapably *very* difficult. Even one's native language
in which a lifetime of practice is invested, even that language
fails to express what we really mean, and is not clearly
understood even when crafted by the best speakers and writers.

Many of the best minds have attacked the problem of designing
a better vehicle for thought and international communication.
Descartes, Leibniz, Plato, Lao-Tse(!), Jesperson, Saussure;
philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, linguists.
They cast a small light among giant shadows ...

But we could all benefit greatly from a practical auxlang
right now. This is the critical moment in history, and we
are divided (and conquered, i.e. politically controlled)
in uselessly competing/conflicting ethnic/language factions
just at the point where global cooperation and understanding
is most needed. Small world, huge danger!

English isn't working to solve this problem of division,
there are too many barriers, in its archaic spelling that
not even its native children can master, its widely variant
pronunciation non-standards, its heavy reliance on idioms,
its myriad subtleties of word connotations.

A few auxlang ideas seem to work well. My own favorites are
Ido, Glosa, and Occidental, but none is best in all respects.
Boiled down to a few technical points:

* light part-of-speech marking
* small but powerful set of roots
* subject-verb-object phrase order
* consistent affixes/compounds
* mostly CV, no consonant clusters
* recognizable mnemonic vocabulary
* few rules and no exceptions

I've been able to successfully read/write/speak only Occidental.
It can be understood by the Novial/Ido/Interlingua people,
so I had hoped for unification there ... But minor details
often separate more effectively than major ones, it seems,
because mankind is unkind, quarrelsome and short-sighted.

> In "The Loom of Language", Bodmer/Hogben claim

> their arguments and language, when discussing

Also, Mario Pei's "One Language for the World" was a major
influence on me. I agree that their arguments were leaky.
But they certainly inspired a lot of people (I think) in the
right direction. Today we understand more about how people
learn language, and it is clear that pidgin/creole languages
*are* the easiest for adults to learn, and that they are
sufficient in expressive/communicative power/efficiency.

Most people hate grammar, with a passion. Hogben and his
anointed successors have produced the least grammar-bound of
auxlangs. Glosa really should win therefore, unless it were
cluttered with unneeded frills and sloppy vocabulary, and was
not published in the one obvious place and manner (the WWW).

If people began to use such an auxlang in an actual ongoing
global speech community via the internet, a rapid convergence
would occur to purify the language beyond any individual's
ability to design it. Snowball on hill or in hell?

> Interglossa is a failed language, abandoned by Hogben.
> This suggests that it was not a decisive improvement

Lingua Franca *did* work for approximately a millenium.
I think the key is to discover the language, not create it.
Research into creoles, and the interlinguistics experiments
of the 1900's, all seem to point back to the LF approach.

I think Glosa is dying, despite so much interest and potential;
then a new project along these same lines might succeed.
Or else wait for machine translation, or use Occidental now.
I would like to see Wendy relinquish control of Glosa now to
someone more dynamic and visionary, who would open-source it;
maybe this list-owner, for instance. Glosa needs a version 3.

Languages don't evolve; they change.  This change is neither an
improvement nor a debasement.

I suspect that the ge- prefix (and I agree that it's a prefix; nonsense to
say a language without grammar -- it's like saying "a skeleton without
bones") comes from gene, the verb most often used in passive
constructions.  This is easy enough to remember.

You mean an ancient language like Chinese, or Hawaiian, or . . . wait,
none of those have cases, conjugations, or other "trappings."

In truth, I doubt that a lack of declensions improves the learning curve
all that much.  For every noun case you absolish, you provide a
preposition or word order rule that must be learned.  We simply are more
used to showing case with prepositions than with declension -- so it seems
easier to us.  The very definition of ethnocentrism.

1.  Perhaps the ge- doesn't come from that particle, but from a
contraction of gene.
2.  It's easier to provide some particle to show participial relationships
than to make rules for circumlocution of participles.  The particle ge-
disappeared from most germanic languages because the participle was often
adequately marked alreay witha  suffix.

Dear Jay,

I was wondering if you would direct me to an example of the Nazi-promoted
"WeDe"-sprache of the interwar years in Europe.  The one commendable use for
it I'd heard of was the bridge it could provide for speakers of Plutdietsch or
any of the other hybridizations of "pure" German used in Europe, Russia,
Canada, Australia, Africa, America and South America at the time, and help to
consolidate 'Aryan' identity on a global scale.  This 'Aryan' consciousness
part is deplorable, of course, but the dream of an Ursprache to reunite all
the scattered speakers of Proto-Teutonic in the pre-Christian era of Europe's
history is an attractive one.  If Bruce Gilson is your "expert" of choice in
this regard, is it possible to get a web-link to his home page, for further
investigation?  Thanks for mentioning "WeDe" in any case; it will stimulate
follow-up elsewhere on this subject again at least, so til next time, With
best regards, Joseph Carson

I quite agree that the changes that happen to a language over time
are totally devoid of moral significance.  I'm not absolutely
certain that they are without aesthetic significance, but it is
fruitless to discuss the point.  I'm not sure what else you might
mean by "improvement or debasement".  A language may be improved
in a particular pragmatic sense, e.g. improved for ease of
learning, by such changes.  I tried to make it clear that I did
not regard being primitive, or the reverse, as being either
improved or debased in any moral or comprehensive sense.

But philologists (I am told - don't mistake me for one) suffer
from the delusion that the changes that happen in a language over
time are not quite random, but on the whole move in particular
directions as time passes.  They think they have identified
characteristic changes which can be found in all languages.
Under the influence of this delusion they successfully predicted
the character of proto-Greek before Linear B had been deciphered.

It seems not totally unreasonable to refer to the changes that are
characteristically associated with the forward direction of time
as "evolution".

No.  I mean one that has not evolved as far as modern Chinese.
In fact ancient Chinese writings have complex grammar.

I suggest that you read Bodmer's "The Loom of Language".  I don't
think you quite appreciate the reality.

Word order is not a problem in languages that have shed such
complexities.  It isn't something that has to be learned, it is
the only way you can do it.  Or to put it in another way, you can
order words in any way that works, although some ways may be more
popular with native speakers.  English, French, Ido and Glosa all
have a similar word order.  German is totally different, and in
classical Latin such a thing hardly exists.

> > 	Til seint Iame beo i-souht   that I schal a-signe,

While I'm waxing lyrical (I'll recover in a minute), probably the
best remembered and loved example of the y-, i- prefix is in
Chaucer's description of the Wife of Bath,

	Upon an amblere esily she sat,

And now, as someone has already said (in a funny word order), this
is way off topic, and I'm bowing out.

In which case, what's your objection to the ge- again?

The changes in a language are not, by any means, random.  Do not, however,
take this fact and run with it to asume that there are, in fact,
characteristic changes "which can be found in all languages."  We were
able to determine the character of prot-Greek because we're quite familiar
with the processes of linguistic change in Indo-European languages -- but
apply the same set of sound changes that have affected, say, Greek, to,
say, German, and you'll end up with something incomprehensible to both.

Most people hold connotations of improvement in their definitions of
"evolution," but okay, assume not.  My point is, languages do not "evolve"
toward greater simplicity any more than they evolve toward greater
complexity.  They merely change.  After all, Old English was a *lot* more
regular than modern English -- just as Latin had more case endings than
Spanish.

> > > It has cases/declensions, conjugations, grammatical gender and

Let me also point out that Finnish is hardly an ancient language, and it
has all of the above.  You've got this strange linear view of history that
simply isn't tenable.  Most Indo-European languages have tended to drop
their declensions -- but that doesn't mean this is a universal through all
language groups.

Again you have this sense of forward movement that *simply isn't there*.
Languages don't evolve "far" or "not as far."  They change.  Period.

Pray share with me what reality that might be.  I'm three hours from a
good university library right now, and can't get the article.

"it isn't something that has to be learned."  Surely you can see the plain
stupidity of that statement?  Chompskian linguistics aside (far aside,
please), it's obvious that *all language is arbitrary* and therefore *all
language must be learned.*  This includes word order, declensions,
orthography, phonology, and all the nicities of grammar and structure that
you find so "primative."  Glosa is easier than natural language not
because it lacks declensions, but because it is *completely regular*.
Therefore, learning one rule is good enough for every word.

Let's try an example.  In Latin, the genitive of a noun ending in -us is
-i (assuming of course it's masc. -- there's a class of neuter nouns in
-us whose rules sometimes differ).  In Glosa, the genitive of a noun is
formed by prefixing the preposition [de].  Now, if all Latin nouns ended
in -us, and all Latin nouns formed their genitives by adding -i, then why
would that be inherently any harder to remember than the preposition "de"?
It simply would not.

The only reason you find languages with decleensions "harder" is the fact
that they are foreign to you.  This is ethnocentrism.  And the fact that
you consider languages with characteristics of your native language to be
more "evolved" than other languages is pure chauvinism.

    There definitely could be something in it for all of us.


    Sign Language has progressed far beyond the simplicity of spelling on your fingers, and could in fact be the most suitable a-cultural medium for communication across the cultures.


    In a similar vein is the new Langenscheidt's PICTURE TALK - Global Communication at Your Fingertips.  This is a small, pocket-book for the traveller who passes through many lands: the book has no words, and not even any page-numbers - because these would imply a cultural bias; instead, it has pictures grouped wiith things and situations you might wish to communicateover, during your travels: the communication is achieved by fingering the relevant picture and making the right associated gesture, pointing, questioning, angst, beckoning, etc.


   It's all going non-verbal and non-literal, folks!


   Signed communication can never reach the speed of reading, but would be comparable with the speed of speaking; and using the "Picture Talk" as a prop for communication might be a shade slower, again, but would get you out of tricky situation, with virtually no learning curve, and no need for specialised linguistic ability.


   Where does Glosa fit into this scenario?  The learning of a 2000 sign vocabulary could be comparable with getting the Glosa basic vocabulary under your belt, and the learning curve for using Glosa's syntax might be comparable with doing the same thing for signing's sytax and inflection.  However both Glosa and signing require the two people, in the communication pair, to be reasonably fluent in the communication system.  With Glosa, one can make up and deliver sentences, while checking for the odd unknown word from the dictionary .. similar to hunting for the right pictures in Picture Talk.

   And, of course Glosa has the advantage over signing, that a person can communicate across space by using a telephone, and across time with by using written notes.


   Perhaps in some future time the seasoned traveller will learn Glosa (or whatever the IAL is) and signing, and use one or the other dependiing on the skills of the person with whom he wishes to communicate; but also, he would carry a picture book to allow him to communicate with people who had neither literacy or signing.


Saluta,

  Robin

I just started reading Joseph Conrad's story "Typhoon".
Maybe I should wait until it comes out as a picture-book.
Destroy the intercultural gap by destroying all culture?



[this is the meaty part, please consider it seriously]

> The learning of a 2000 sign vocabulary

I have never seen an auxlang basic vocabulary with
less than a 1300 or more than 5000 roots.
Gode's dictionary of 27000 words has around 5000 roots,
same as the Occidental Radicarium or Novial Lexike.
Adam Kilgariff's lemma-list for 93% English coverage
has 6000 items of which not all are roots.

It should be possible to merge a few of these lists
and have a sure-fire effective and practical vocabulary.
The equivalent roots can be added for a number of auxlangs,
particularly Glosa, which most desperately needs a
systematic full vocab. All synonyms should be included.

Then out of the full list of 6000, it should be apparent
that some roots are far more essential than others.
They could be scored by frequency of usage and stratified
into "top 1000", "basic 2500", and "full 6000".
In basic lists the less-favored synonyms can be dropped.

This would be an achievable and valuable project,
and could be shared among several auxlangs, I imagine.
It is a killing task for 1 person, but if several people
would work together it can be done in a short time.
Anybody here interested? Any ideas for improvements?

Glosa roots (= words, usually) tend to a CVCV pattern
with the final vowel being meaningless 99% of the time.
Lingua Franca also had meaningless Romance euphonious
or etymological final vowels that were insignificant.
Ido roots are easily obtained by removing their final
part-of-speech vowel or verbal -ar suffixes.

So as an example, the English word "basket" is 3983th
in frequency in the Kilgariff list. Even if Glosa had
no previously defined word for it, one could easily be
found in LF or Ido, but actually Glosa has 2 of them.
So, I would like to have a table of Kilgariff roots
crossed with auxlangs sorta like so:

Kilga   LF     Glosa        Ido   Novial  Occid  Latin
basket  gorba  korba,mirso  korb  korb    corb   corbis

There might be a fair number of roots present in Glosa that
do *not* appear in K's list. Of course they would all be added
as well. What I am proposing is like Rick Harrison's list,
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5383/uld2in.html
which should also be merged into this root table/database.
I think his other list is entirely subsumed by K's,
but might help define the "basic" vocab subset.
http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html

Having such a list available on the web would *not* violate
anyone's copyright etc. It *might* lead to a convergence.
At least it would be interesting, and *useful* in filling
the gaps in our favorite auxlangs or conlangs.

I see no evidence that the ge- is unnecessary.  It helps to avoid
ambiguity -- much like the ambiguity of your second sentence.

Incidently, _The Loom of Language_ is 56 years out of date and written by
an amateur.  You might do well to take your facts from something written
within the decade, at least, and by an expert.

It is easy to say that.  You are pretending to be an expert when
on all the evidence of this exchange to date you don't know a bee
from a bull's foot on the subject.  You are totally ignorant.  At
least, that is the only conclusion possible from what you have
written.  You have disclosed absolutely nothing but hostility and
phoney pretence.

Yet every current scholar on the subject (at least, every current
reputable scholar on the subject -- that weirdo who thinks Basque is made
of English anagrams might think otherwise) holds that languages do not
change in any universal direction.  They do not become more isolated, or
more inflected, over time.  In fact, inflected languages tend to become
isolated languages, and isolated languages tend to become agglutinative
and then inflected.

Your argument against the Glosa ge- is unfounded, absurd, and completely
ridiculous.  You hve not addressed any point at all which I have raised.
My perfectly good argument that inflected languages are not harder to
learn, inherently, than isolating languages was ignored -- insted you told
me to read a book which, upon examination, consists of amateur linguistic
sketches (with numerous errors) and a typically mid-century attitude long
since abandoned by every serious scholar in the field of linguistics.

There are plenty of perfectly good objections to Glosa (for instance, I
personally think that  alanguage without ambiguity is a language without
poetry, and if a language lacks poetry -- it is useless [of course, having
translated a tiny bit of poetry into Glosa, I must say the language *does*
contain ambiguity, despite assertions to the otherwise]).  But the
objection to the ge- prefix on the grounds that it's unnecessary (yes,
technically, any one feature of language can be circumlocuted -- skimmed
an interesting book on the topic once, reducing language to a set of fifty
[I think] primatives) lacks merit.  The use of ge- allows the flexibility
of the passive voice, a technique that permits the poetic ambiguity above
mentioned.  Your further argument that ge- comes from German and is
therefore bad is completely baffling.  First, I see no evidence other than
coincidence of form that ge- comes from the similar Germanic preffix.
Second, I see no reason why adopting, even if it did come from such an
origin, a handy participial prefix is bad.  Your attitude puzzles me, your
arguments baffle me, and your sources tickle me.

Incidently, it is only "pretense" if I do not, in fact, have the education
I imply.  Since I have a MA and am working on my PhD, I don't think it's
technically pretense.  Hauteur, maybe, pretense, no.

In Internet I saw document for teachers (the document was written in

Esperanto, are defeat, but there is a language, wich founded on English, and
may be IAL, It's name is Glosa.

Ido made the 2 most necessary improvements to Esperanto,
eliminating the goofy circumflexed consonants, and using
more naturalistic-looking roots. Here is a great URL:

http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/

Esperanto is not so popular as its propaganda claims.
Nearly everybody tries to learn it, fails and quits,
losing faith in the idea of an IAL. Very bad result!
All other IALs are superior technically to Esperanto.
But I like very much the idealism of Zamenhoff, and
the nice sense of community that Esperantists promote.

Occidental is even much better than Ido, because
it uses more naturalistic affixes as well as roots.
De Wahl proved that Ido is not so "scientific" as it claims,
and replaced its false-logic with a truer psychological logic.
The thing that works best for me is the analytic verb
phrase structure in Occidental, modeled on Lingua Franca.

Today it may be possible to improve IAL design by study
of creolistics. Perhaps now a more radical design would
be acceptable to western Europeans and Americans.

Glosa has the right basic syntax, again like Lingua Franca;
I believe that "analytical" is the right way to go for a
global auxlang, though no disrespect is intended toward
"synthetic" Russian and other great cultural languages,
they just don't serve well as auxlangs (nor does English).

You are irrelevantly extending the universe of discussion.  I am
very well aware of this fact.  (I found it out from "The Loom of
Language", which discusses the discovery of it in Indian
languages.)  But what might happen afterwards, to English or
Chinese, is irrelevant to the fact of the retention of an antique
inflexion in Glosa, one which provably is unnecessary because most
Germanic languages have dropped it.

You have now, though, accidentally, admitted that there is
directed evolution, the fact you have been trying to deny.  Why
have you created an argument on the point, when the most you can
now say is that the evolution is cyclic?

> Your argument against the Glosa ge- is unfounded, absurd, and completely

Why should I address any point you raised, when you cited no
documents and did not say you had any credentials on your own
account?  Why should I address myself to crap challenges?  The
best you could do was, when I had cited a source, express your
precious contempt for it.  You cited nothing better, nothing more
modern.  You contributed nothing.

I can trust you to be right on that, of course?  What would you
know about serious scholars in the field of linguistics?

You insinuate, without clearly saying, that you have examined the
book I mentioned.  "Upon examination"?  Whose?  You still need to
read it.

"Perfectly good"??  The issue is in part the number of forms of
the noun, or the verb, that have to be memorised.  I am not going
to quote extensively.  Read it.  Read about the number of forms
for the finite verb in Sanscrit, Greek, Latin and English.  The
numbers drop from staggeringly large to insignificant.  The
problem with inflexions is first that you have to memorise them,
and second that the systems of classification invented by
grammarians, such as some small number of declensions or
conjugations, is artificial.  The language in the wild is much
less regular.  If Bodmer is right, no-one for centuries has
studied classical Latin.  At least at school, in non-specialist
courses.  What is studied is an artificial simplification.  The
real language did not have the regularity of the noun and verb and
adjective classifications that are taught.  Overwhelmingly, in
Latin, and even more so in ancient Greek and Sanscrit a set of
case endings is unique to a particular noun, and correspondingly
for verbs.

Your perfectly good argument that inflected languages are not more
difficult to learn, Haw haw.

The internet dictionary project of W. Patterson/ R. Gaskell/ P.
Bartlett (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) goes in that
direction.  Let us improve this one before starting another
project.

This may be helpful.  My suggestion for strategy:

You certainly know Interlingua de Peano/ Latino sine flexione
(see www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/2948/).  It is a direct
forerunner of Glosa and nearly the same as Glosa.  Main difference:
Glosa has a limited (= good) but unsatisfying vocabulary.  Interlingua
has no own vocabulary.  It uses the Latin one and a simple word
derivation scheme instead.  With this scheme, - a bit refined -, we
could improve Glosa words.

Examples:
  Glosa words: "silva" and "silvi" for forest, wood
  Latin:       silva, ae, f., ablativus silva, then ...:
  Peano:       silva
  --->         "silva" is good, "silvi" is bad and should be
                 eliminated.
(I started to make a list of those bad synonyms, will post them later
for discussion.)

If Peano leads to a bad result (for example "flexione" has too many
syllables), prefer the shortest old Glosa word or the best solution of
other IALs.

 > Glosa roots (= words, usually) tend to a CVCV pattern
 > with the final vowel being meaningless 99% of the time.

I agree.  This is very important!  But do not kill all of them.
"silv" would be harder to speak (consonant cluster with the following
word), harder to understand by listening and sounds uglier.

As long as we do *something* about it, anything, I will be happy.
There hasn't been any effort since Robin's latest M$ crash.
It is impossible for any person to do alone, but ideal for
a community-effort project to resusitate Glosa.

This is a great idea! I never thought of LsF as similar to Glosa.
It does come to a similar solution, from the opposite direction ...

Cleanup of errant/variant final vowels should be done, and clearly
you do have the ability to accomplish that. Then we would have
a clean Glosa 6000 to analyze further (as planned a year or 2 ago).

I think a bare root really is CVC (silv-) but the word *does* need
a euphonious and etymologically plausible vowel final (silvA).
Most of the world strongly prefers or requires CVCV words.

What I much *dislike* is the use of final vowels to differentiate
meanings, e.g. "bale=ballet, bali=throw". That's a big mistake,
fortunately there are not very many of those in the current vocab.
If one forgets the correct final, which is so very easy to do,
it should *not* matter. Since the finals are unstressed, nobody can
hear the difference between "bale/bali" in actual speech anyway.
Besides, I hate ballet ... and to me "baila=dance" (from Spanish).

Germanic languages still mark the participle; they just do not do so with
the prefix ge-.  Why don't you understand this?

Why is it harder to learn -us -> -i (assuming such to be regular among all
classes of nouns) than "de"?  It's not.  And all you can do is attack me
personally.

I have an MA in English.  You had only to ask; that's hardly "prising" it

Let's not do that here. Flame wars are unhealthy.
Besides it was just a misunderstanding.
This isn't the AUXLANG list ...
Anybody who wants to argue should do it
entirely in Glosa and without translation!

My argument was with your ideas, not you personally.  Instead of
addressing ideas, you have attacked me personally.

Here, let's be mo0re constructive: what if you had absolute control over
Glosa?  How would you mark the participle, if not with ge-?

    I have just rejoined the list after a lengthy absence.
Unfortunately, the first few posts I received just today seem
to be a bit of a flame war, and that is disheartening.

    In any event, I do have some catching up to do.  I have downloaded
the archive of messages but at the moment am only up to early April in
reading them, and hastily at that.  Perhaps someone could kindly fill
me in, by private email if that would be more appropriate.  When I was
last on the list, there was still some discussion of a sort of "Glosa
2500" vocabulary.  Not having yet gone through all the archive, I do
not know that status of that.  However, if there are online resources
in general to which someone could point me, I would be grateful.  (Due
to some pruning of old files, I no longer have a lot of old
references.)  Thanks.

That's not how I remember it.  I don't remember a *question*, but an
assertion and an insult to German.  Perhaps I misunderstood.

In any event, I suspect that ge- cannot be circumvented; a participle
saves massive amounts of time and adds a certain simplicity to the
language that otherwise would be bled away in circumlocutions and
ambiguities.

Patrick, I started out with the reasonable question, whether the
ge- in Glosa could be avoided.  I'm still waiting for an
answer.  You are the one posing as an expert.  You could have
answered the question, perhaps.  A person who really has the
expertise would do better trying to teach, rather than trying to
stalk and make fools of those who do not.

It's a very interesting (troublesome) problem.
Some examples from the well-known web page:

        ge-lose feli               Lost cat
        Id frakti; id pa frakti.   It is breaking; it broke.
        Id pa gene frakti.         It got broken.
        Id es ge-frakti.           It is broken.
        u feli; qi ...             The cat which ...

It looks like the only options would be "ge-" and "qi".
And there's no present participle BTW IINM.

One might be tempted to try "pa-lose feli" and "nu-frakti violina",
but they'd be tough to distinguish from real verb phrases in speech.
With regular words vowel-terminated, maybe -nt and -d, or -nd and -t?
Then, "loset feli" and "fractint violina". Nicer, but not Glosa.

Using a relative clause seems the worst and clumsiest solution,
and I might even prefer to use participles entirely,
replacing all relative clauses, with the side-benefit of
eliminating the *ridiculous* "Semicolon de Hogben".

So maybe the thing to do is keep using "ge-", and justt
add a new particle for the present/active participle??
But they might get mixed up into verb phrases. Oy!!

And, of course, this is the problem with an absolutely analytic language,
at least for me.

One could convey present active participles as adjectives, so:

u feli -- the cat
u skribi feli -- the writing cat

But then, does this perhaps mean "the writing behaves cattishly"?

I can picture that precisely, it is a common occurance:
http://catty.com/~catty/jpg/kt_keybd.jpg

Another temptation is to use the Saxon Genitive, as in
"the cat's writing was incisive". It seems strange that
Hogben so greatly praised Chinese grammar but selected
the euro-genitive preposition "de" instead of the sino-
postposition "de", which is so much more useful,
serving for both relative clauses and genitives.

Interesting.  First Michael wanted to kill "ge-" and the past
participle.  Now we go into the contrarian direction and want to
create a new participle (present participle).  But the argument is
right.  I have the same problems, too.  Three notes from me:

- In German the present participle is normally not used.  It is bad
  style.  But it is available.
- In English the present participle is used more often.  But often it
  is only the sign of the continuous form.  Therefore Glosa has "du".
- My suggestion:
    Try to avoid it!  Else "u skribi feli" is "the writing cat", if
    there is no ambiguity.  Else make a new full sentence "u feli
    skribi e ... " (coordination) or take a prepositional clause like
    "u feli ko skribi akti".

Karo Plu Amika,

  Patrick, which is the ethnocentricism?

  The use of  ~ge-~  in Glosa, or references to the German language?

  On general principles I would find reference to national languages distracting, in Glosa,  however, on occasion, a natlang reference is pertinent.  Ron Clark, originally had imagined that Glosa, like any good science report, would always use the Active Voice.  Subsequently he added the mechanism for creating thhe participle,, which is the mainstay of the Passiive Voice: so, the ~ge~ participle-former is a relative new-comer to Glosa.


  The concept of "primitiveness," for me, takes two forms in language:-

    a. if a language has many featues that are similar to those present when it was first recognised as a distinct language, then it is developmentally relatively primitive; and

    b. if a language has a low level of complexity, then it is organisationally primitive.

  In the case of Glosa, I hark back to the lexical roots, to suggest that, being based on the Classical roots of Greek and Latin, by comparison with the deriivative European languages, it is relatively primative.  As well as that, I would suggest that, although many ethnic languages do feature very complex tenses and inflectional structures, I understand that root-word languages, like Chinese and Glosa, are developmentally and structurally more primitive than are the more inflected languages.


   Good news: the _Glosa 2000_ dictionary is alive and well and available from Richmond, UK.  I bought one two months ago; it is still in new condiition, despite use, and could be sent to you.  Its 12Stg price-tag ammounted to a cost of approx A$20.  If you chose to acqquire mine, I'd sendiit to as soon as you sent your land address.  Then I would buy another from Wendy Ashby at Richmond.  I include here my signature in case you wished to write directly to Wendy, yourself.

    Let me quote from a work of fiction.  It may not be the best
ficion around (nothing on the level of Tolkien), but it may serve
here to illustrate a point.  (I typed this up some time ago.)

=======

    Consider the following excerpt from David Eddings' fantasy novel,
"Domes of Fire" (1992).  Eddings' fantasy series "The Elenium" and its
sequel "The Tamuli" are set in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, medieval
world with the common motifs of chivalry, magic, religion, and so on.
Kalten is a brave and likable, but not always bright, Church Knight of
Elenic language, race, and religion, and the Church Knights are trained
to cast spells using the Styric tongue.  Sephrenia is a polyglot wisewoman
of the Styric race.  In this episode, an Elenic party are in the Tamul
Empire and need to learn to speak Tamul.  Incidentally, linguistic theory
is not my point here.  My point is the misjudgment of considering that
one's own language is somehow the "natural" way that all humans think.

        "Kalten, dear," [Sephrenia] said gently, why was I trying
      to teach you Styric?"
        "So that I could perform magic tricks, I guess."  He
      shrugged.  "That's unless you just enjoy making people
      suffer."
        "No, dear one.  It was just as painful for me as it was for
      you."  She shuddered.  "More painful, probably.  You _were_,
      in fact, trying to learn Styric so that you could work the
      spells, but in order to do that, you had to be able to _think_
      in Styric.  You can't just mouth the words and make them come
      off the way you want them to."
        "Wait a minute," he objected.  "Are you saying that people
      who speak other languages don't think the same way we do?"
        "They may think the same way, but they don't think in the
      same words."
        "Do you mean to say that we actually think in words?"
        "Of course we do.  What did you think thoughts were?"
        "I don't know.  But we're all human.  Wouldn't we all think
      in the same way and in the same language?"
        She blinked.  "And which language would that be, dear one?"
        "Elenic, naturally.  That's why foreigners aren't as clever
      as we are.  They have to stop and translate their thoughts from
      Elenic into that barbarian gabble they call language.  They do
      it just to be stubborn, of course."
        She stared at him suspiciously.  "You're actually serious,
      aren't you?"
        "Of course.  I thought everybody knew that's why Elenes are
      smarter than everybody else."  His face shone with blinding
      sincerity.
        "Oh, dear," she sighed in near despair,

=======

    Sorry, Robin, but I just can't agree that "of the Planned
Languages, Glosa is the closest to the Language of Thought."

That's just *morphology*, i.e. suffixes and prefixes
in a thin disquise, eliminating Glosa's claim to fame.
(I'm not counting word-compounding as morphology.)
There is no other well-known creole-like auxlang, that's
my interest in Glosa (perhaps Lingua Franca can be revived).

As a set of word-building affixes, the "bo-" set are clearly
inferior to those of the other auxlangs, Ido for instance.
They do not add anything to expressivity, but increase
complexity and the all-important difficulty of learning.
Far better to drop them and use plain compounds, I think.

If there must be morphology in Glosa, I would prefer
participles or some such useful things. But that would
be like a surrender of principles, not a good direction.

But part and parcel of Glosa is its word economy.
The original Interglossa idea was to use a minimum
set of roots as in Basic English but derive these from
Greek, or mainly from Greek and then assisted by Latin.
The fact that there are more Latin roots in Glosa is the
work of Ashby and Clark.

Eventually the dual feature of some roots, having both
Greek and Latin roots as synonyms, will catch up with
usage and a preferred root would be used more than the
other.

I do agree that 1000 words is just bare minimum. And
1200 to 2500 words would be more usable; also the
Glosa 6000 would need weeding out and more work
done on compounding for the sake of adding terms
to the wordlists instead.

Since,
Jay B.

This isn't an attempt to knock Glosa.  I'm just trying to clutch
at the spirit of it, grasp what it is all about, see if there is
something in there that is really the way forward.  It is a later
invention than Ido: is it based on a fundamentally better
approach, and does it show?

Is it, for example, easier to learn?  Are creoles and pigins
really easy to learn, or are they just an unsophisticated
compromise?  Do they work well, or do they just allow people to
get by after a fashion?  Are they just where you finish up when
improvising across a language barrier?  If so, does that fact mean
they are easy, or just minimal?  Is minimal good, or just limited?

Is Chinese really easy to learn? Issues relating to Chinese may
include (a) there are too many words; (b) grammatical
simplification was accompanied by great elaboration of idiomatic
phraseology.  Has such a set of helper phrases (presumably a few
thousand of them) been provided for Glosa?

On ease of learning of Glosa, the most conspicuous piece of
evidence that I have discovered is that the discussions in this
list are carried on in English and not Glosa.  If there were
simply a FAQ in English posted here regularly, and the actual
discussions took place in Glosa itself, I'd be more hopeful that
the language had something going for it.

Does it take 60 years to invent or instinctively create a pidgin
or creole?  Why, nearly 60 years after Hogben's publication, are
we doubtfully trying to work out how to speak of a writing cat, or
a writing person?  How many people use this language in real
communication, for example, internationally?  What meetings have
taken place in which the proceedings were entirely in Glosa?

One of Hogben's key insights, or so he thought, concerned the
importance of word economy, as exemplified by Basic English.  The
thing that takes so long in learning a language is acquiring the
words.  The only criticism he has of Peano's Interlingua was that
there were too many words.  It met his approval in having little
grammar.

It should therefore be possible to carry on written discussions in
Glosa using just the vocabulary of 1000 or so words that Robin or
someone else has already put up on the net and which I printed out
one time.  I'd like to see you experienced Glosa people doing
that.

I have tried as a rank beginner, with rather little success.  I
could only guess and hope that the accumulation of words was
intelligible.  It seems that because there is little formal
grammar there is no formal sentence.  There is nothing you can
analyse and determine to be a complete sentence, and therefore a
verifiably complete and verifiably intelligible communication of a
thought.  Whereas a rank beginner in Ido has no difficulty in
creating a sentence.

And that language is the normal medium of communication among
students of it.  And the root+suffix system is a reasonable
response to the word-economy issue.  That's why Zamenhof adopted
it in Esperanto.

On ease of use and ease of learning, Glosa does not even seem to
be in the game.  Therefore, what are we doing here?  Is it just a
matter of loyalty, of irrational attachment?

I've looked around on the Internet trying to find what is the key
advantage of Glosa relative to other IALs.  As I understand it,
the key claim is that it has no inflexions, genders, "or
diacritics" (!).  And that it has special words (rather than
inflexions) to signify the plural.  That is the key claim, and
presumably is supposed to be the key advantage.  Is it an
advantage?  We have seen (and we are seeing above) that Glosa has
proceded to acquire inflexions.  Interlingua also acquired
grammar.

Glosa seems to be a language that after nearly 60 years of
development, four times as long as any other IAL, has not reached
the point of being usable, and is not used.  Is this a fair
assessment, or am I being unreasonable, or clueless?

I can understand that it might be of interest to students of
language, of linguistics, as an object of experiment.  Is this the
real purpose of Glosa?

A toy for linguists I can understand and sympathise with.  Of
course, that would be a specialist tool that the rest of us would
be ill-advised to waste our time with.

Michael Talbot-Wilson

Yes, especially for adults who are not linguistically talented.
Adult 2nd-language-learners are *the* market for any true IAL.
For over 800 years there was a perfectly acceptable one
in actual use all aroung the Mediterranean, and it probably
spawned most of the other creoles such as Tok Pisin.
It was the Lingua Franca, based on Occitan/Italian/Catalan,
with a structure very like ... Glosa.

By using Latin synonyms and having a better dictionary,
people might write more in Glosa. I can do it easily enough
in Occidental, and without suffixes it gets even easier.
That does put a mighty heavy load on word-compounding ...

Because I like griping a lot. With such a minimal grammar,
any mistakes really stand out ... I think Glosa is still
one major revision away from success. But it should work,
because the Lingua Franca did. There were only a few
years of design, during the 1940's and the 1970's.

No way! 1000 is too few. Glosa has 1800 published on the web,
another 4000 in the "deluxe edition". Not all were well-chosen,
but if users felt free to expand the vocabulary, then in a
year or two (I think) it *would* rapidly evolve to usability.
The authors have choked their baby by holding it too tight
(and making it speak mangled Greek instead of vulgar Latin).

1. u/plu (ADJ) NOUN es/pa/nu/etc VERB u/plu (ADJ) NOUN

2. add prepositional phrases after nouns

That's enough! Adding more features just makes it worse.

Glosa es ma facili de Esperanto!!

Yes, but I'm trying to grasp how effective Lingua Franca was,
whether a bare facilitator of cross-cultural communication, or a
flexible language which could facilate, for example, precise
explication of a theory.

I'm slightly doubtful that LF spawned Tok Pisin.

If my understanding is correct, LF has been lost and its detailed
structure is a matter of speculation.  It had a simpler grammar
than French (though it called itself the French language).  But
was it as grammatically simple as the ideal creole or pidgin?

There are other IALs with stuctures like those of Catalan and
Italian, greatly simplified.

A set of rules that work both ways from Greek roots to Glosa words and
back again automatically turns any classical Greek dictionary into a Glosa
dictionary.

Now, if someone would just *tablulate* such rules, we could begin coining
words left and right.

*   Phew!
    I will answer the two main questions in one piece.
    I do apologise to all, but with civilisation under threat, I have had
to 'de-prioritise' the Glosa work.

    The quick, and nasty, answer is that learning Glosa is not useful, at
present.  I have written three fairy stories into Glosa, and Wendy has
written one.  There is no body of Glosa literature, neither translations or
originals.  It is as if Glosa has got stuck at the "work in progress" stage.
    However, the nicer answer is that Glosa offers a promise of ready
communication .. especially at the technical level, but also, it can be
used with a distinctly human feel.  The 'promise' has not been taken up -
in a world hell-bent on conspicuous consumption and a self-destructive,
aggressive competition for what is left of the Planet's resources.  There
seems no time for people to contemplate ideas that are simply worthwhile,
but not immediately profitable.

    While I cannot speak for Bodmer and Hogben, nor for their 'scathing'
attitude towards other auxlangs, I can say, from my discussions with Ron
Clark, that he never published any critical comment about other designed
languages.

    The language Hogben hined at was obviously Interglossa; however, he
found that no-one was interested in his simple language in Post-War Europe,
so he stopped worrying about solving the problem of global scientific
communication, and the Cold War rift did not help, either.

    So the hard thing to say is that Glosa, which is even simpler,
morphologically, than Interglossa, has a very valuable part to play in our
'globalising' (with a little "G") world.
    The Internet cries out for a single 'international' communication
medium, and Glosa could rapidly become it.  Had Bill Gates acquired Glosa,
by now, all PCs would be carrying Glosa parsers in their operating systems.
 When it comes to man-machine intefaces, with meta-languages acting as the
interface media, Glosa would fit in perfectly.
    Maybe I should sell Glosa to Bill Gates: that would solve financial
problems for Wendy and me; and would cut the competioion dead, in the
distinctive Microsoft way!

     I have recieved letters fron Chinese people, saying Glosa's syntax was
easy for them, because it was about the same as that of Chinese: one sixth
of the problem solved!
     In my discussions with the Chinese Linguist, LIU Haitao, we used a
combination of Glosa and Esperanto - he writing Esperanto, and me Glosa -
and I have to go on record, as saying that I had to translate his Esperanto
into English before I could be sure I knew what he meant.  Haitao had used
Esperanto for a number of years, and could use Glosa quite happily, too;
however, he was lost when he ventured into English.  He did feel that Glosa
had been oversimplified, but I feel he did not give Glosa a fair trial ..
sticking with the Esperanto that he knew.
      Africans I have written to using Glosa, wrote back in good Glosa, and
did not quibble about this usage, or that: I sort of assume they felt the
language was fairly 'natural.'
      Writing scientific reports in Glosa is very dry and very logical:
perhaps Glosa could be described as "techno-speak."
      So, there we go: if the idea of a language being intuitive, and
logical, have any validity, then so has Glosa.  While designing the
'speak-as-you-look-it-up-in-the-dictionary' language, Ron Clark also had
the good sense to ensure that both the appearance and the sound of the
phrasing was pleasant, as well as making sense.
      Regarding the rules, and there is basically only one - a word is
modified by its precedent - Ron was horrified at the thought that learners
should sit down and internalise a grammar book of rules; children certainly
don't.  So Ron decreed that people would speak Glosa without first studying
a Grammar book.  In fact, he virtually banned the idea of producing such a
guide.  This was, perhaps his biggest mistake: he uvastly over-estimated
the initiative that could be shown by those making up the bulk of the human
race.  For research purposes, and against the wishes of Ron and Wendy, I
did set up a tabulation of Glosa's grammar, but this was purely
descriptive, and not prescriptive.
      While this tabulation of Glosa's grammar is in reasonable shape, I
would NOT recommend first 'learning the grammar' so that you could 'apply'
the rules when you spoke or wrote Glosa.  I would follow Ron in suggesting
that learners understood enough of the philosophy behind the language so
they could learn by 'jumping-in-the-deep-end' and
'speaking-as-they-looked-it-up-in-the-dictionary'.

      Sorry about the rambling answers.

     The matter of Glosa's possible superiority over its ccompetitors begs
a question.  It assumes that the present amateur promotions of Planned
Languages represents a valid Darwinian competition in which the 'the
survivor must be the fittest.'
     The evaluation of the situation requires more intelligent thinking:
which language, if adopted to serve as the world's IAL, will most benefit
the human race, this is the correct question.  And such an innovation
begins at Mother's knee, and is followed at the School M'am's desk: so, the
experiment, in which Klaus Lankilde taught Glosa to Middle-School children,
near Atlanta was a runaway success.

     And finally, I do feel that such questions are a waste of my time
answering.  There is a distinct three-strikes-and-you're-out sensation
about it: Lancelot and Ron have been struck out; now we are just waiting to
see how long I can keep batting for, until the innings is over.  We are,
however, still watching to see if Wendy Ashby is going to send in a curly
ball from outfield, to revive the game.

Saluta,
  Robin
    P.S.  Anyone have Bill Gates' phone number?

    With Glosa the Part-of-Speech markers are notably absent, unnecessary,
or missing.  Which, I can't be sure; but, up to now, I have been working on
the premise that the proper placement of a word in a sentence was all the
signposting its function needed.
    There is a chance that owing to a quirk of nature, syntax seems natural
to me, and does not to many others.  On the other hand, nurture could have
played a part - as a result of my learning Parsing and Analysis, as a
primary-school boy, in Queensland.
    The question of Glosa's occasional awkward, consonant-rich words,
mostly of Greek origin, can easily be solved through a deft use of the
culling knife.

>I've been able to successfully read/write/speak only Occidental.

    I would like to know which aspect of the language suits your particular
language skills and propensities.  Have you identified what it is about
Occidental that made it ^click^ with you?

However, perhaps these facets are two aspects of the one gem;
from my reading of "Interglossa", It did seem that Hogben put more effort
into the organising system than into the philosophy and psychology of human
communication.

*   While there was some of the latter, when my Website finally came
online, there could be seen to have been be a level of untidiness in the
presentation of vocabulary in the various printed dictionaries.
    Somehow, the tolerance, shown by the authors, of variation between, and
within, the various dictionaries was not shared by many of the
would-be-learners of Glosa.  Attempts to rationalise the lexicon, through
action on the Internet, only revealed further undiscovered linguistic
confusion; and, as yet, the matter of a solid, complete and unambiguous
Learners Dictionary (slated as _Glosa 2500_) is still in abeyance.

Language, that comes with an easily applied "parser,"  is, in my opinion,
the nu-speak most likely to ^take off^ on the Net.

But on the Basic principle, shouldn't it be possible, with that
bare minimum or whatever is on the Net (Charles says it is 1800 -
I didn't count them), to hold these discussions in the
language?  Why are we talking English?

Yes, on the principle of word economy, too many means too many to
learn.  A rule to generate words might not be such a good idea.
(Hogben's criticism of Interlingua de Peano -- too many words.)

Flexible it was, but precise it was not. All the verbs were
marked by -r, which sounds ridiculous now to Romance speakers
but sure made it easy to parse. Plurals in -s, sometimes a
past participle in -t, most other words ended in random vowels.

Science generates its own nomenclature, which is somewhat
international but equally barbaric, e.g. species names
and astronomical designations. An IAL should be at the
service of the common people, plain and common-sensical.
Nothing on Earth is as practical as trade and conquest ...

> I'm slightly doubtful that LF spawned Tok Pisin.

Sailors who spoke it carried it everywhere, like plague.
Development of a creole merely required enslaving diverse
populations and setting brutal ignorant bosses over them,
effectively stifling their use of native languages.
LF provided some vocabulary, universal creolization
processes did the rest. AAUI.

Bickerton described an "ideal" (nobody agrees 100% on this).
It "should" be SVO and rely on particles for tense/aspect/mood,
virtually no flexions or affixes, and minimal vocabulary.

LF was far from ideal, but was as simple as language can be.
It had no fixed structure, but had one criterion (only):
If and when a statement is understood, it is correct.
The ideal language for pirates, slaves, and tourists!

I like the idea of a pure-ideal pidgin/creole as IAL.
To be even easier for European speakers, it should
use Latin roots. Glosa is not so far from that.

(Perhaps as corporate enslavement of the world proceeds,
the conditions for creole formation will return soon?
I listen to 20-year olds speaking, and shudder.)

*   For me there is a case for making room for such a concept of
"evolution" within the study of language.

    Years ago, for suggesting that because of the many invasions, and
imported linguistic influences, on the Isles of Pritan, the English
language had evolved more than most national languages - with the
characteristics of the present spoken language comprising the 'fittest
survivors' of many linguistic battles.

    For suggesting that such 'evolution' could occur, and that an
acceleration of the linguistic evolution process could yield a "more
evolved, and better" language medium, I was jumped on, and resoundingly
flattened!

    When I said that Glosa continued the evolutionary trends seen in
English, and carried them to their conclusions, raspberries and other rude
noises could be heard.

    However, I do not recant!

    Is the ancient script really all that modern?

    Basic English, of course, was/is basically a fraud.  Yes, it had a
list of 850 words, but it used word-groups such as English's highly
notorious phrasal verbs which cannot entirely be decomposed lexically
into their constituents.  Therefore, the actual working set of
functional lexical units which had to be memorized was far greater than
850.

    For the record, I compiled the "Glosa Basic Reference" which was,
and may still be, the primary word list on the world wide web.  I sent
the preliminary version in hard copy to G.E.O. for their consent to put
up.  I had noticed that the printed lists of "Glosa 1000" were not
consistent in their content.  So, using some rudimentary computer
utilities, I collated the lists and added a handful of words (probably
not more than twenty or so) from other Glosa sources.  Then I formatted
it into an HTML document.  Because the only browser I had available at
the time was a little primitive and did not do tables, I adopted the
text-only format that I did.  Because of the way the lists (G-E/E-G)
were structured, I never did count the words exactly, but they were
about 1600.

    Pham Xuan Thai's Lingua Sistemfrater (or just Frater) was rather
Glosa-like but used more Latin roots than Glosa, as best I recall
without digging out my copy.  (And it used only thirteen consonants and
five vowels.)  Actually, I think Hogben was too optimistic in his
assessment of understanding of Greek roots.  A lot of people --
including many of those worldwide who use the "International Scientific
Vocabulary" -- may *use* words with Greek roots more or less as lexical
wholes without thereby having a very good knowledge of what the atomic
roots themselves mean.  Those of us with a modicum of English etymology
and a smattering of Latin and classical Greek may know some of them,
but I suspect that even your average scientist may not know them well.

> I like the idea of a pure-ideal pidgin/creole as IAL.

Using separate words in place of the number inflexion of the noun
or the tense inflexions of the verb seems perfectly obvious and
easy.  But I'm not certain that there is any advantage in it.

That Glosa claims it but doesn't fully do it is a bit strange.
And after Peano, Interlingua grew grammar, also a bit strange.

And regular inflexions are also perfectly obvious and easy.  Isn't
this fact implied by the other one?  Is there any essential
difference?  Isn't is purely a matter of orthography?  If it is
agreed that the "ge-" prefix is an inflexion (is it?), is anything
achieved by making "ge" an autonomous word, and pretending we have
dispensed with inflexions?

Entire avoidance of morphological change in derivation is more
problematic for me.  Do you not lose clarity or precision at this
point, unless supported by numerous traditional phrases?

If I say "Quick!", you need context to begin to know whether I
mean "Come quick!" or "Wasn't that quick!".  If I say "Quickly!",
perhaps it is just idiom that excludes "Didn't he come quickly!"
Or maybe it is an obscure rule of phraseology.  Do we need a
catalog of such rules, to mirror them in the pure ideal
pidgin/creole?

Maybe a change of word form in derivation is just helper wheels.
But when you can't ride, aren't helper wheels nice!"

Frankly I haven't got a clue as to why some don't use
Glosa. I've used it on some posts. One specially
addressing Charles objections to Glosa as I saw them.
Why some criticize in English, I dunno. I would
suggest that if anyone wants to criticize they
would do it in Glosa :-))) Doesn't that seem fair
enough? Heh heh... Frankly I can't stand anything
the guy writes since he tried getting me kicked off
the net by crying to my ISP.  So why even pay attention
to someone who continues to criticize and badmouth???
I dunno...

But Mike, your questions are good and they made me
think that more usage of Glosa is needed.  Keep
reminding us... I did the same in the Novial-Liste
and I still believe that constant use would flush
out trouble spots and converge usage to the point
where it works well enough.

If you have an inflection for number, you must specify number
in each and every noun, or be irregular. But many languages
do not require this. Same for tense, etc.

You gain the ability to not specify, if it isn't relevant.
It is best to eliminate irrelevant mandatory distinctions.

to do with Glosa?

Thinking of patterns of derivation, used in one IAL and
not in another, suggests the idea of redundancy, things that are
avoidable but may be helpful.  Or may be a hindrance.  Helper
wheels.

They may be a help because the beginner needs or wants extra to
make out the meaning and to create the meaning.  And the market of
an IAL is always beginners, rather than native speakers.

They may be a hindrance because there are more things that you
"have" to get right.  Redundancy means that it doesn't matter if
you get a few things wrong.  Still, if there is more stuff you
feel you "have" to get right, that is a problem.

The Glosa tense marking seems to have an advantage over inflexions
which have no redundancy.  It's not as easy to be wrong with "pa",
you put it there or you don't.  It's easier to be wrong if the
present ending is "-as" and the past ending is "-is", a single
vowel change, easy to overlook.

In practice, is this a real advantage, or a real problem?  I guess
it doesn't make much difference.

If inflexions were banished from Engish we might have something
like:  The ing move finger do write and after did write do move
on.  In some languages the adjective may optionally precede or
follow the noun.  The tense marker, adverb or whatver it is could
do the same, so we could have "moveing" as well as "ing move".

To put it another way:  The anta move finger as write and after
is write as move on.  If there is a present marker as well as a
past marker there is no advantage over inflexion.  It is necessary
to say:  The ing move finger write and after did write move on.

Hmm... bottle's empty already.

Yes, I finally grasped that.

On the subject of use of the language, may I suggest that members
of this list take a look at another mailing list,
bablo{at}view{dot}net{dot}au{dot}  It is a list for all IAL users, and the basic
rule is to post in some IAL, any one.  Use of native or natural
languages prohibited.  I haven't seen Glosa used there, but there
have been messages in quite a few other languages.  If you can
decode a message, reply in Glosa.  If the language is usable.

From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 10:40:04 -0700


I would like to compile a new word list, as described
in previous messages the past week or two, with the
help and advice of any interested persons. It would be
placed on a web page, in the "public domain", etc etc.

It would need to grow slowly and be regularly updated
and maintained. At first it might have just the basic
Glosa and Ido roots, but I'd like to add Latin,
Occidental, and any others that people want.
This would require a fair bit of cooperative work.

Perhaps the Glosa 6000 could be added with password access;
I wouldn't want to offend the surviving Glosa author or
violate copyrights. Maybe the project should be passworded
anyway during the early stages of development.

I think the BNC English list would serve best for the
"key" field, but in database terms there cannot be any
truly acceptable "unique key" because of polysemy etc.
Still, having the English and Latin and perhaps other
natlang equivalents should make it clear enough to humans.
This approach worked well in the Novial Lexike and the
OCC Radicarium, neither of which is (fully) online.

To reduce the scope of the project to practicality,
it should focus on the most essential 5000 or so
roots likely to be present in an effective IAL.
The best lists AFAIK were listed earlier.

I am not decided exactly how it should be done, and
would appreciate hearing comments from anyone interested,
or any offers of assistance. Please send any such
replies directly to me rather than to the email list.

*   Well, Friends,
    After spending a serious amount of time trying to disambiguate
Michael's Glosa I gave up.
    The message seems to be saying that if one reads what Michael has said,
above, they will see where he lightly touches on a beginning of knowing.
    All that is needed - for the expression of the participle (I assume) -
is already in Glosa, by its very nature.
    The plans, included, to touch the IAL, will not do so without being
made more uniform, but, having said all that, (we should) simplify by
throwing out all that is not needed.

    Michael, had you included an English-language rendition (in square
brackets) after your Glosa, we could have treated the situation as a
training exercise, as well as one of information; I would have suggested
alternative - non-English-idiomatic - ways of saying what you intended to
communicate.


     So, here is a personal note from me: there is a serious difficulty
with Glosa:-
much time can be spent in editing, and attempting to correct, Glosa that
trans-scribe national language idiom.

     Glosa IS fairly easy to write, BUT, at the start, I ask learners to
edit heavily: read OUT ALOUD what you have written, so that you hear the
Glosa - not the 'national-language' translation that comes from your inner
voice.  Ask yourself, "Do I understand, directly, the Glosa words that I am
hearing, without the need to consciously translate them into my national
language?"
     When the answer is, 'No,' then you are probably hearing your
national-language idioms transferred into Glosa, and the resulting Glosa
that you have written is not following the rules of logical syntax: recast
the sentence using simple, direct language, of the "dog bites man" variety,
and re-read the edited version to HEAR the Glosa again.  When you
understand, directly, the Glosa you are hearing, then you are writing good
Glosa.
     I would suggest attempting complex phrases and clauses after you are
confident that your simple Glosa sentences are being understood.

Saluta,
  Robin

Adding u/plu and pa/nu etc particles helps a lot, though
it can get ugly if overdone. Prepositions are still difficult,
but all the auxlangs have too many prepositions for my taste.

There are fewer of those in Glosa than most other auxlangs.

Mainly it's 2 things, both catering to laziness:

1. The analytic verb phrase structure (auxiliary verb ha/es/fa
preceding main verb) fairly similar to Glosa's pattern.

2. The recognizability of the vocabulary (basically, the latinate
portion of English) which Glosa does not match up to.

    Robin, I for one think that you are dead wrong in your gloomy,
sour, anti-capitalist diatribes.  Can we stick to Glosa here?

    This is good.  It is one things to discuss various aspect of a
conIAL.  It is another, and an unproductive other, to go around trying
to tear things down.  The Auxlang list has heard quite enough of this
sort of dialog of the deaf.

    Which I think is unrealistic, simply because people with different
native habits are going to look things up in different orders.  To one
person, SVO seems "natural" and "the way people think."  But the next
person says, "No, SOV is truly natural and truly the way people think."
And so on.

    In this I think he was only partially right.  While it is true that
children do not ordinarily learn from a formal grammar text, neither do
they learn free from context, including nonverbal cues.  The
paradigmatic sentence approach is all well and good as far as it goes,
but the problem is that it does not go far enough.  The context is
missing.  Connected text more than just isolated sentences is needed in
order to show, for example, that incessant marking for things like
plurality, tense, and aspect are simply not necessary in all cases, no
matter how much monoglot anglophones have been bamboozled by English
into thinking so.  And so on.

> 'speaking-as-they-looked-it-up-in-the-dictionary'.

    Again, this is based on an invalid assumption which, in my opinion,
can only lead to problems.

    However, there is the position that there need not be one, single
international auxiliary language, one-size-fits-all.

Yes, Glosa will seem very close to most
Indo-European languages in its roots.
Greek and Latin have a lot in common
with the Slavic, Germanic languages and
the languages of India... due to their common
ancestry.

Thanks for the list of words, I enjoyed
reading how they compare.

     Title:
Lexicography Considerations for Tok Pisin

     Abstract:
          This article examines a number of issues that are involved in
dictionary
          compilation, including terminology, elicitation, kinds of
meanings, lexical
          relationships, componential analysis and definitions. Definitions
may be both
          folk and technical and the methodology suggested here profits from
the
          semantic framework and theory of Wierzbicka (1985, 1986, 1987), as
well
          as from other sources. Illustrations are given in Tok Pisin as
well as in
          English. The article concludes with a number of practical
suggestions which
          are relevant in compiling dictionaries in the vernacular languages
of Papua
          New Guinea.

`See my above words touching ease of learning.  The thing we are
discussing, the "just-said", (the prefix sign of the past
participle) has been shown to be unnecessary in natural languages.
Design of (touching) artificial languages has included not only
making them regular but also making them simple by discarding
everything that is unnecessary.'

The word list didn't contain "learn", thus "easy begin to know"
for ease of learning.  Likewise "only", which I synthesized as
"without more" (sine ma).  Also, "my" was missing, thus "by
means of me" (per mi).

I meant "dealing with", "about", "concerning".  The word list
contains a set of "associatives", one of which is "touching" =
"tange".  It was the nearest I could find to "about".

Seems to show that it is hard to get by without grammar, without
some way of showing how the words stand in relation to each
other.  That a succession of words as you find them in the
dictionary doesn't work.

Admittedly, that is a spectacular rush to judgement.  It was my
first ignorant attempt to write in Glosa.

Yes, I guessed that there had to be something like that.  How many
such phrases are there in Glosa?  Would a completely-defined
grammar such as that of Esperanto or Ido avoid the need for them?
You just wrote something about
"speaking-as-you-look-it-up-in-the-dictionary", which is what I
tried to do.  Can it work?  Without also looking up patterns in a
phrase-pattern book?

Okay.  Will need to think about that.  Again, it's not quite what
I understood you to be saying in another message.

Less is more. That's a good design principle.

A full list of common English words translated,
that would make it easy for the all-important beginner.

Of course many terms would be compounds; a minimal
vocabulary cannot afford separate roots for each of:
learn, teach, instruct, study, review, know, understand,
school, professor, etc. Glosa is like Tok Pisin, and there
is a web page showing how to build words without affixes:

Prepositions are trickiest part of Ido too, I think.
Some languages prefer to use verbs, like "concerning".
But that doesn't seem to be the Greek/Glosa way: "peri".

Hogben referred to the Chinese concept of "full" and "empty" words.
Normal dictionary words, nouns/verbs/adjectives, are "full".
Particles are "empty" but they implement much of the the grammar.
How else to mark a phrase boundary? (taking preps as particles)

That's nothing, I can write worse Glosa without even trying.

I would call that "relexing" and it is a major strength of Glosa
that direct relexing can work as far as it does. With a good
"phrase list" and just a few examples you would have succeeded.

Let's see: "ko (u) boni lexi-seria lista e xxx? (plu) oligo exempla"
I made up "word-series" for "phrase", and couldn't find "just/only".
Not so bad overall, eh?

It should be possible to automate this word-lookup process.
Type in English, output decent-enough Glosa. I used to have
something like that, going from Glosa to English. Hmm.

*   Unable to comment properly on Michael's message, I would say what I can about the ~ge-~ form:-

   . yes, it is an abbreviation of ~gene~,

   . Passive Voice was not considered a necessity by Ron Clark, originally, and was excluded from Glosa,

   . it was used to create the participle form, much as "-ed" or "-en" in English,

   . ~gene~ does seem the natural VERB to the Passive Voice, even though to say ~gene ge-X~ [=to be Xed] does seem like a mouthful,

   . I am in favour of Glosa having a specific Passive form, and know that this hyphenated affix does look like an inflection, though it is more of a "flag",

   . in different situations other VERBS than ~gene~ can be used,

   . while Ron Clark did derive the affix from ~gene~, he did say that it represented an interesting coincidence, with German also using #ge-# to form its Passive form.

But wouldn't I succeed as quickly, perhaps more quickly, with the
five-page "complete grammar reference" (really three pages plus
lists of affixes) of another IAL, one that does not pretend to
have no grammar, but instead, completely defines and precisely
states the grammar?

The problem I had was with the lack of definition, the fact that I
had to guess how do signify "to learn" rather than "learning", and
"does not have to be" rather than "must not".  If the words are
invariable there needs to be a book of idioms, phrase patterns.
How big a book?  If it is less than five pages, where is it?

And five pages of phrases, one per line, would be huge compared
with five pages of grammar tables.  Really, it must be a single
page.  It should be easy to put that page in the Net.  Yet it is
not there, it seems.

So, what is the vital gleam that makes Glosa the way forward?

I understand from what you (Charles) have said that only
sufficient grammar to disambiguate the communication is disclosed.
That is the advantage over a tense inflexion.  You can say "pa"
but can skip it sometimes, and almost never need to specifically
state that the verb is in the present tense.

I can understand that that leads to snappy and efficient
communication.  A language that always has to cart endings around
may become a little tedious.

That might be an important advantage of the perfect first
language, but when we are talking about an IAL, an eternal second
language, to be forever newly-encountered by adults, used in
international communication, writing international treaties and so
on, perhaps that advantage of brevity should be traded for a clear
definition of a regular grammar.

So I hope that is not it, the key factor.  Incidentally, it seems
to be shared with Peano's Interlingua.

Something that I have noticed is that some IALs differentiate
themselves by taking some factor, good in itself, to an extreme.
E.g. Occidental seems to sacrifice all else for the dream of
at-sight readability by Europeans only.  Is the grammarlessness of
Glosa, or the creoleness of Glosa a similar enthusiasm, good in
its way, but ultimately too monochromatic?

RUNNING CAT is really *semantically* equal to CAT RUNS.  If Glosa is closer to the

If someone will mail the grammar to the list, probably it will

I doubt it, because I have trouble keeping my eyes open
scanning the list of Ido affixes, for example. It is easy
to grasp the system of it, but very difficult to use.
And remember Ido was simplified from Esperanto, relying
much less on extended agglutination. Still it's too much.
Gode's interlingua abandons that systematic affixation.

Glosa has less grammar than the others, so its system
should be more easily grasped if presented properly.
But what is "the" proper way? I think many ways should
be available, because one size cannot fit all people.
Let's have more varied Glosa grammar descriptions
on the web, and see what works best for whom.

> The problem I had was with the lack of definition, the fact that I

You're right, the presentation needs to be improved.
I think it would be a good group project, anyone could
make a web page or two, and discuss them further here.
Let's start a movement! Revolt!!! Er ... sorry.
Syd's is very good.

Maybe it's better to have more easy-to-read Glosa examples,
maybe in the form of short stories; not polished, just simple.
I found that reading the many issues of Cosmoglotta, a magazine
written in Occidental, was most effective in teaching the eyes
how to parse the language without thinking of grammar at all.

Recent neurological studies show that a large percentage of
language processing is very low-level visual pattern matching,
developed only by extensive practice. I had the experience of
a sudden easing of effort and yet with greater understanding,
after about a week or two of mere reading.

You may benefit from the formal order of systematic grammar,
but most people can't do that. They need a different method.
Why economize on web pages? Let's have hundreds more,
all different, there's no center to the fabric of the web.

Sure, maximize easiness for speaker/writer and listener/reader.

We can have both. Lawyers can always remember to add all
the unnecessary particles, and repeat it 16 more times,
and then translate it anyway into 25 languages.
Actually, I think a language for *common* people is needed;
the upper classes do not need an auxlang, may not want one.
A clear grammatical description would be wonderful, though.
Much is now written about pidgin/creoles, let's tap into that.

> So I hope that is not it, the key factor.

The key factor is that people really have fun with this one.
It is liberating to dispense with (most of) annoying grammar.
And yet it does work as a full language, with little effort.
(But I don't recant that serious updates to Glosa are needed.)

> E.g. Occidental seems to sacrifice all else for the dream of
> at-sight readability by Europeans only.

It does cater to eurolang speakers. Worked great on me.
OCC is extensible though, not ossified/frozen. I like
regional IALs, one for Europe, another for east Asia.
Swahili and Malay are kinda like that. IALs are no dream,
they are common throughout all of history.

Perhaps the problem is too many would-be language-tinkerers,
such as one finds on AUXLANG, who think their grammar tweaks
will save a grateful world or something. There is no need to
invent water when we are swimming in it. (But is it fresh?)
Let's be lazy, take what exists, simplify it a bit, be happy.

Glosa may be more internationally easy-to-learn than others.
No big advantage to Europeans, easier pronunciation for most.
The ideal global language *should* be colorless, unbiased;
let people provide all the color.

    I think that Glosa's greatest weakness, so to speak, has been its
presentation.  At the risk of blowing my own horn, I would refer people
to my essay, "Thoughts on IAL Success" at
http://www.smart.net/~bartlett/thoughts.html

    I think there should be both, paradigmatic examples for those to
whom that is the better approach and some sort of more formalized
grammar exposition for those who prefer and can make use of it.

> Actually, I think a language for *common* people is needed;

    Perhaps more than one IAL on more than one level.  I did once
exchange two letters in Glosa with a man in China.  They were not
particularly deep, but casual communication is often like that.

> (But I don't recant that serious updates to Glosa are needed.)

    My opinion has been for quite some time that the main things Glosa
needs are better wordlists and better promotion.  I don't really have
a lot of problem with the structure itself.

    In the end, it is probably *not* linguistic characteristics which
make or break a conIAL.  After all, look at Esperanto. ;-)  We can
tinker and diddle to our heart's content to strive ever after the will
o' the wisp of the "perfect" IAL, and at the end of the day we may not
necessarily be much farther down the road.  Once an IAL is good enough,
other factors come into play.  Sooner or later the tinkering just has
to stop.

    Considering that present Glosa users, dotted around the world , are
already kitted out with Glosa 1000 lists and _Glosa 6000_ dictionaries,
unless we can come up with a way of sending them REPLACEMENT dictionaries,
then, further fundamental research into lexicon formation will prove to be
confusing, if not divisive.

    Can we look at a balance sheet of the benefit of further fundamental
changes in the spelling of the Glosa lexicon, versus the the cost in
frustration and loos of the user-base?
    This does not mean that we should not go ahead with the
standardisation, addition of missing words, and general trimming of surplus
synonyms .. leading to the production of a _Glosa 2500_ Learner's Dictionary.
    Such rationalisation can be incorporated fairly readily into the
G-E.ALL and E-G.ALL files; however, for people without access to the Net or
to a computer, it seems only right that such Glosa supporters should be
provided with the Upgrade (2500) dictionary.  Somehow, the  Glosa 2500
dictionary, with both G->E and E->G sections, must be printed and made
available to all Glosa-pe.  This cost will probably be bourne by me;
however, the formation of finalised lists can be done by all on Glosalist.

    Before there are radical changes, however, Wendy Ashby must be involved
in the plans: this is a matter for diplomacy; while Wendy is the the
remaining Author of Glosa, we have to consider the future of the language.
I cannot become involved in a power struggle for "control" of Glosa: it is
my hope that future changes to the language will be achieved through a
consensus of all involved.

*   The word "bad" here, means not aligned with other derivatives from the
original Latin root.  Now, this "i" could have been a mistake, or the
result of much consideration by Ron and Wendy; I feel that thhe thinking by
Ron and Wendy needs to be taken into account before specific changes to the
spelling of words is decided.
    A reason for not wanting to see the promotion of numerous spelling
changes to Glosa is the disturbance it will cause to the existing
user-base.  I recall, all too clearly, the purtubing effect on me, during
the 80's, of regular, fundametal changes to the Glosa lexicon.  My
intuitive feeling is that numerous changes to the lexicon, in the present,
will, on balance, be counter-productive.

'second consonantal sound'.  Hence  s-i-lv-i  is fundamentally CVCV.

#   Arr, well, yes.  An answer.
    The situation as I see it is that the idea of a "participle" - of
adjectivising the VERB - is a special case, similar to the "gerund" where
the VERB is nouned.

    In Glosa, the gerund was already covered - using the unchanged
substantive word and adding the 'noun flag', ~u~.  The partciple, demanded
by the Passive Voice, however, needed some other trick; was there an
'adjectival flag', or might one have to be invented?  EG

skope   =   look at; to look at; watch
u skope ju-an   =  the watching boy
un andra, skope u ju-an   =  the man, watching the boy
u skope pa es an favori tem-uti   =   watching was his favourite pass-time
an pa hedo skope plu ju-fe, to u mari-margina   =   he enjoyed watching
       (the) girls, at the sea-side
u policia-pe pa vide u ge-skope an, akti u krimi   =   the policeman saw
       the watched man commit the/a crime
u-la andra pa eqa u persona; qi pa gene ge-skope ex u policia-pe  =
        that man was the person who was watched by the policeman

*   This is how I understand it, too.  Forming a participle, by using a
simple pre-fix, is a good pragmatic solution.

    Then, it can be disambiguated by forcing the "continuous tense", thus
using the ~du-~ as the present participle prefix.  EG

  u du-skribi feli  - the writing cat

  [Dear folks, dear Bill, dear Robin,
    Let me say again, that I think, that the internet-dictionary-
  project of Bill Patterson and others
  (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) ...is on the right way.
  We should continue to work on it before starting another project.
    As I wrote, I translated the Core-dictionary into German
  (URL is www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggldt.htm).  During this work I
  found some points I dislike.  I wrote this together to the list below
  (Sorry, it is a bit long for a mailing list, but it was important to
  me.).
    Please do not be frightened by the things below!  It could recall
  to you, how deep Glosa is already in the beginning stadium.  Let us
  not be scared, but bring it right!
    I would be very happy, if you could read my notes, perhaps send
  some comments and then improve the dictionary.  If these things will
  be fixed, we have quite a good dictionary, I think.
    Sorry for my not perfect English.
  Greetings]

  2. Notes to Single Words
  3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root
  4. Problems for a German
  5. Core and Glosa 1000



1. General Note
---------------

  You can sort them as you want: bad words remain bad words.  The Glosa
  vocabulary is inconsistent and unsystematical.  All its problems are
  mentioned and discussed in glosalist already.

  Main problems are the
  - arbitrary, random ending vowels (difficult to learn) and
  - having two source languages (Latin and ancient Greek).

  New words should be created.  Marked (e. g. with an asterisk) as not
  original Clark/Ashby/GEO-words, they should replace the 'bad' words.
  Of course, this must be done very carefully.  Wendy Ashby must be
  involved and asked about the consideration work behind these words.



2. Notes to Single Words
------------------------

A list, only catchwords. Alphabetical order.

2.1.  "anti-co" has in Literary-dictionary the meanings "but; however;
        nevertheless; though".  Please give back the Glosa-1000 "sed"
 for "but"!
2.2.  "demi" (half) is French. Latin "semi" (or Greek "hemi") would be
        better.  (Remember "U Lupus"-translation-discussion.)
2.3.  "diptera" (fly) is the animal (the fly), to fly  is "peti" or
        "vola".  "vola" is to be found under "flight". Perhaps write
        "fly {the}" and "fly {to}".
2.4.  "deskende" (descend) not necessary, instead simply: "skende
        kata".
2.5.  "eroti" (physical): error: must be "physical love".
2.6.  "es" (to be) is missing. "onto" instead. Please take Glosa1000's
        "es" again!
2.7.  "kapita": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives German "Haupt"
        (head, main..).  "Core" gives "cape". That could mean a "high
        point of land going out into the sea" or a "sleeveless garment,
        hanging from the shoulders".  The file "Glosa Basic Reference"
        gives "kapota - bonnet", that would be a synonym to the second.
        "kapota" is not in Literary-dictionary.
2.8.  "ko{n}" wrongly sorted in. Must be treated like "kon" and/or like
        "ko".
2.9.  "kordiali - warm". Not the temperature is meant but an emotion
        (Remember our "U Lupus"-translation-discussion. Cf. Latin "cor,
        cordis" - heart).  It would be better to take "meso-termo -
        warm" and for "kordiali" only "hearty".
2.10. "krati-grega": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives for "Regierung"
        (government) "krati".  So "krati" is enough, "krati-grega" is
        not necessary.
2.11. "krispa": Core gives "contract". Note: not the "treaty" is meant,
        but to "make shorter; to curl".
2.12. "kritiki-ra":  The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" says "kritici" is
        enough for German "Kritik", so "kritiki" would be enough for
 "criticism".
2.13. "mali-dice": "curse" (German "fluchen") is not always "swear"
        (German "schwören").  "I swear I love you." is not "mali".
2.14. Regular comparison is necessary for an auxiliary language. So:
        peiora - worse (schlechter) ==> ma mali
        pesimi - worst (schlechtester, am schlechtesten) ==> maxi mali
        optimi - best (bester, am besten) ==> maxi boni
2.15. "satura" - rich: Latin "satur, satura saturum" is satisfied,
        copious; better for "rich"/wealthy would be "pluto".
2.16. "porta" (harbor) should be "portu", because "porta" is also
        "door" and "to carry".
        (cf. Latin: portus, portus m. - harbur, u-declination, so root
               would be portu;
                    porta, portae f.  - door, a-declination, so root
        would be porta;
             portare           - carry, a-conjugation, so root
        would be porta (too))
2.17. "positi": The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" gives German "Posten,
        Stand" (post, place).  For "to put" would be better "loka".
 "loka" is already in Core with "to lay" (see 3.xx).
2.18. "repei" (reply): perhaps typing error, should be "repli".
2.19. "vid-abili": Simpler and better would be "vide-abili".  If we
        take "vid-abili", we should take also "aud-abili" instead of
 "audi-abili" and  "honor-abili" instead "honora-abili".
2.20. For English "first" Glosa has not only "prima" and "proto", but
        also "mo" (in after-position!).  "mo {afterposition}" should be
 supplement to Literary-dictionary, and be prefered for
 Core-dictionary.
2.21. Some words may not so necessary for a beginner's dictionary:
        palpebra (eyelid) (see also 3.60)
 operkula (lid) (see also 3.60)
        runi (rune)
      Other examples could be found, discussed and eliminated.  This
      will be shown by practical use of the dictionary.



3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The intention of the internet dictionary project was to get a
beginner's dictionary without synonyms (words with same meaning).

Nevertheless the list below shows synonyms of Core.  This results from
English synonyms and computer sorting.  Some of the synonyms are
"real", (you know the thesis "A language has NO synonyms."), others are
at least so near together, that one of each pair should be removed from
Core and move to a higher level dictionary ("Base" or "Literary").  A
discussion how to treat each word will be necessary.

More tricky is the problem of words with related meanings.  They have
to go back to the same root, but a lot in Core do not.  It could not
be, that we eliminate part-of-speech-markers in Glosa, and then related
words, differing only in part-of-speech, have different roots, only to
distinguish them.  Then an old-fashioned part-of-speech-marker-system
would be better.
(e. g. iloto (dirty) - adjective / tolo (dirt) - noun).

Reading the list below, please keep in mind:
- Sources for Glosa words's meanings are the Richmond lists (and there are
  several different lists, so perhaps you have a list with other meanings)
  and the meanings of the classical origins.
- The author (me) is not a native English speaker.

Now the list:

4. Problems for a German
------------------------

4.1 It is not easy to distinguish between:
      hekasto (each, every) / panto (all) / holo (hole) /
        (G1000:) singu.
4.2 The German does not distinguish:
      ali (any) / uno (some)
    ... and an international auxiliary language MUST NOT do either!!!



5. Core and Glosa 1000
----------------------

The discussion in glosalist showed, that here there are two opinions:

The Glosa traditionalists (maybe Robin Gaskell, Nick Hempshall, Marcel
Springer) think, Glosa-1000-words should be prefered. Otherwise the
language would be damaged, the small group of Glosa-users would be
splitted.  A text written with Core-dictionary could not be understood
by a Glosa-1000-learner.

Others (maybe Bill Patterson, Charles) say, Glosa 1000 does not really
exist, because the several 1000-lists contradict each other. They
think, to give Glosa the chance of becoming THE world language, the
best synonym each must be chosen.  These best synonyms are not found
by the taste of two language designers, but by systematical research,
perhaps by comparison of several Romanic languages (Latin, Spain,
Italian, French), other modern languages with many speakers (English,
Russian, German) or other auxiliary language's design drafts (Ido,
Novial, Occidental, Interlingua de IALA) or perhaps by a word
derivation scheme (e. g. Peano's Interlingua/Latina sine Flexione).

Perhaps a compromise between these two groups could be found.

Below there is a list of words of Core-dictionary not in Glosa 1000.

What can we do with it?
- The book "Central Glosa" contains the interesting word list
  "English 5000 to Glosa 1000". It gives more than one meaning to one
  Glosa word (should be 5000/1000=1). With this list some more of the
  Core-words below could be expressed with Glosa 1000 words.
- Some of the words below differ to 1000-words only in the ending
  vowel.  The ending-vowel is a problem on its own (---> start a new
  project).
- Some of the words below may be in one Glosa-1000-list, but not in
  mine.  The contradiction of GEO-word-lists is a problem on its own,
  too.

Now the list: it shows Glosa-word,  Englisch meaning, (German meaning)
(==> Glosa-1000-Wort)]:

5.1.   absenti  absent (abwesend) ==> G1000: ab; ne ci; ne la
5.2.   abstrakti  abstract (abstrakt, Auszug, abstrahieren)
5.3.   acikula  prickly (stachelig)
5.4.   adagio  slow (langsam) ==> G1000: no-tako; lento
5.5.   adeo  goodbye (Leb wohl!)  ==> G1000: vale
5.6.   adhesi  adhere, adhesive (kleben, klebrig)
5.7.   adhesi-ma  paste (Kleister) ==> G1000: pasta
5.8.   adinami  weak (weich) ==> G1000: no-resista; debili
5.9.   adjace  local (örtlich) ==> G1000: lokali
5.10.  adjusta  adjustment (Einstellung, Anordnung)
5.11.  ...
...

  (Stop, stop, stop.  You will kill me, if I would post the whole
  list here.)
...

5.895.  vultu  expression (Ausdruck) ==> G1000: dice klari; emotio
5.896.  zeloso  jealous, jealousy (eifersüchtig, neidisch, Eifersucht,
          Neid)
5.897.  zemia  loss (Verlust)
5.898.  zeo  boil (kochen, sieden)
5.899.  zeugo  team (Team, Gruppe, Arbeitsgruppe, Mannschaft)
          ==> G1000: grega

But the final vowels hardly ever matter, and so don't really
need to be spelled "right". They'll all sound like schwa anyway.
Still, they should be etymologically plausible if possible.
There might even be a desirable cross-correlation with the
main vowel, e.g. C-a-CC-e vs. C-o-CC-i (I just made this up),
to make spelling super-easy. Hey, I should patent this "technology"!

I agree that many of the C-V-CC-V patterns can be pronounced easily
by nearly everyone globally, therefore are acceptable. Actually,
having 3 consonants is better mnemonically and even esthetically.
The final vowel is not significant, so there are under 2000 good
CVCV roots available, but many times more CVCCV's; and it's better
not to use all of them, for easier recognition.

The endings are insignificant and can be ignored in 99% of cases.

Latin is better, but Greek can't be removed, and often
they conflict. I don't know any solution except toleration.

Add words where necessary, but we must keep all the old too,
as "archaisms". Zamenhoff called it "the method of neologism".
Then let evolution sort it out.

I am unhappy with the whole bunch of u/un/mo/ali/singu/prima/etc words.
Should be "un = one = indefinite", but this will probably never happen.

Agreed, it is unsavory to me also. Perhaps if the whole set
of words in the determiners/quantifiers group were analyzed,
there could be found enough good words to use, and then leave
the others out of the new "basic" set.

Sure, let's just find the 2500 *best* words and call them
the "net basic 2500" set; maybe add some that are missing.
There is no way any 1000 word vocab can handle even the most
basic use by beginners. (But 6000 is too many to learn.)
Esperanto started with around 750 but quickly grew.
The "bad" words can be ignored, and eventually forgotten.

    Somehow, the Glosa 2500 dictionary must be made available in many
more languages in addition to English.

    Strange.  Many languages with a somewhat isolating morphology form
passive constructions with some form of a verb like 'to be'.  What is
wrong with 'es ge-X'?  It seems to me that the 'gene ge-X' is modelled
on British dialects of English.  My experience has been that Americans
and users of British dialect use "get" rather differently, so that the
'gene ge-X' construction is merely an importation from British English.

    Auxiliary language design involves a lot of trade-offs.  Slavish
adherence to some single principle at all costs, come what may, may
result in an inferior product.  For example, one Esperantist criticism
of Ido's plural construction in '-i' is that it creates an inflection
instead of an agglutination, and some Esperantists insist that only
agglutination should be allowed, come hell or high water.  I am not
attempting to mediate that dispute, but only to point out that some
designers have been willing to bend some one principle on other
grounds.  To say that Glosa must *ABSOLUTELY* eschew anything which
even seems to smack of a dreaded inflection seems to me to be merely
foolish.  Something may be beautiful as a paper theory, but in the real
world something else may actually be more practical.

    Although there are a small handful of word pairs differing only by
the terminal vowel.

    Possibly only from the mouths of us native English speakers, who
tend to blur and reduce our vowels.  Other users from different native
tongues may be much more precise in their vowel articulations.  I
suggest that native-speech sloppiness should not be an excuse for poor
articulation of an auxiliary language.

I disagree! Final vowels are very important. They help us to
understand words clearly. Just because English and French do
something of the sort does not at all mean that it is desirable.
Actually the lack of clear final vowel confuses the sound. To
a native speaker of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian etc. the lack
of distintc vowel sounds in English means that everything sounds
like it's mumbled. Vowels help to make communication easier.
Since,
Jay B.

And "somewhat isolating" includes IALs with more "grammar" (yes, I
mean grammatical machinery such as inflexions and agglutinated
glue).  Several of them are more isolating than English, but don't
try for the extreme of Glosa.

> wrong with 'es ge-X'?  It seems to me that the 'gene ge-X' is modelled

Or 'es X-ge', 'es X-ata'?

Interesting, that english version of number 2 suggests to me that
she is in the habit of running, which glosa would indicate explicitly
by ~more~. Also ~eqa~ seems to me to be to "formal", why not
use the more relaxed ~es~. I don't see any problem with the

For me, the various Glosa 1000 lists are the heart of Glosa, and should not
be
radically altered. Only where mistakes or contradictions are found, should
changes
be made. Leave the rest to evolution by actual usage.

I don't feel the same about Glosa 6000, which I think is just a registration
of the Greek
and Latin elements in terms already in use by science. This makes them
legitimately part
of Mega Glosa, like any other "international" word (such as those in the
Interlingua
IED), if presented in Glosa form. Such words are available, if the speaker
or writer
feels the need to use them.

I don't think we are free to trawl the Greek and Latin dictionaries for
words, but
should only use the elements of words that are in "international" use. Of
course, it
is true that people don't know what these elements mean. They are just
familiar
patterns of sounds. Learning Glosa gives them meaning. This explains the
sci-tech
words that we have up to now taken as wholes, and so makes Glosa memorable.

I would go with ~silva~ too.

But this raises the question about whether the final vowel should be
"regulated".
Aren't they a matter of personal choice at the moment?

Note english sci-tech words: silvicolous and silviculture or sylviculture
compared with silva and sylvan.

I suggest that to make Glosa clearer and easier to understand, that
A standard Glosa sentence could be looked upon as having 4 phrases:- verb
phrase, and to start with in some sentences, 2 preposition phrases and a noun
phrase, for instance, VP=pa dona, NP=u avi, PP1=a gina and PP2= per andro.
The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the
indirect object PP1 and VP could be at the end. In fact any order would work.
If we all agreed to standardize we could trim the "per" off and have
subjectNP   VP  object  NP and then PP1. I would personally prefer the
symmetry of NP VP NP to either VP NP NP or NP NP VP and I think that
separating the 2 NPs would make the sentence more easily understood. Adding
PP1 at the end would not disturb the symmetry very much. To give variety or
emphasis the order could be varied to NP(old object)u avi VP+"ge"(to signal
the reversal of the positions of object and subject). We now have
possibilities to complete the sentence:- full stop or PP1 or PP2 or both PP1
and PP2 in either order (the English passive can be very useful). The "ge" is
derived from the word "gene" and, as far as I can see could be said to have
little to do with the "ge-" of German.
In Glosa, a phrase seems to have 3 parts, an introductory small word (IW) at
the beginning, the head word (HW) at the end and various bits of adjectival
or adverbial gubbins in the middle(MG).
U + alti + andro. HW is usually followed by IW of the next phrase. Where this
is so, it is easy to distinguish the phrases and IW identifies the phrase's
function. NP, PP,VP etc. The IP of NP could be "u", "plu", "multi" or a
numeral, of VP, "pa", "fu", "du" etc. I personally would like an IP for the
present tense i.e. "pres" or "pi" for present indicative. The IP of a PP
would be a preposition and, as this will be followed by a NP, the word "u"
could be amalgamated into the prep and be omitted .
Adjectival gubbins would need to be in the apropriate NP or it would be
difficult which NP was being gubbinized . On the other hand, as there is only
1 VP an adverbial gubbins could be more or less anywhere and being placed
away from the VP would shorten and simplify the actual sentence.

The order NP  VP  NP PP seems to be the norm as Glosa was initially developed
in England but other orders could be acceptable if it were clear what was to
follow.
(u orto glosa-V--)
u alti andro pa gentili dona plu pusi avi a kali gina.
(glosa neo u---V)
avi pusi plu gina kali a andro alti u dona gentili.        Present tense
implied
(glosa u neo V----)
dona gentili pri gina a kali andro per alti avi plu pusi    pri=present tense
(u orta glosa)
u alto andro du gentila dona plu pusi avi a kala gina. I like this one -
rhyming phrasesâ¦â¦.

*   There is a sadness about this, for me.  I still use the Glosa 6000 book
as my ready reference.  If the consensus is for major revisions of the
dictionary, will we be able to get Wendy Ashby to to do a new edition
through her previous printer?

*   So, I would suggest that a revision, a possible Glosa Ver_3, might come
out first as the 2500-word Learner's Dictionary.  It might have to be
prined in Australia, as I know that Wendy has no spare money for the
production of a new dictionary; so I had better start showing _Glosa 6000_
to printers to get some quotations on the likely cost of a comparable book.
 Needless to say, my finances are not a lot better than Wendy's.

    And until scientific evidence comes up to support either position, I
guess we can agree to disagree.

    This does not mean that I do not understand that Glosa - as a language
for human speech - cannot be improved upon; however, if there is to be any
transition to a Glosa_3, I would like to think that it can occur with the
minimum of damage to the players .. avoiding the typical 'sharp turn on
heel, and walk out' scenario, seen all too often in the Interlanguage saga.

    And there is the remaining question of whether you can put up with the
<italic>textural textual</italic> emphasis, or whether I, and other
late-model users, must put up with not using the bold/italic/underlined
word-processing options?

    Should there be a convention on Glosalist house style?  What does the
panel think?

Saluta,
  Robin

    In general I tend to agree.  Howeer, as I mentioned previously,
when I collated the various "1000" lists into the Glosa Basic
Reference, I came up with more than 1000 wordss.  I am of the opinion
that for basic communication -- not necessarily for writing law codes
or international treaties! -- the vocabulary should be kept within
bounds.  That's why I have not been a supporter of Glosa 6000 as if it
should be the standard.  With a judiciously chosen vocabulary FROM
ALREADY EXISTING MATERIALS (I think I may have originally come up with
the ~2500 figure), it should be possible with good typography to
produce a booklet containing two-way wordlists, examples, and perhaps
a few explanatory notes.

Here is a better quasi-scientific notation which
captures the essential syntax you are trying to
describe informally, now using a rough BN form:

sentence:    (prepphrases) subject predicate
subject:     nounphrase
prepphrases: preposition nounphrase
nounphrase:  (determiner) (adjectives) noun (prepphrases)
predicate:   verbphrase (nounphrase) (prepphrases)
verbphrase:  (auxiliaries) verb

auxiliaries:  pa, nu, du, es, etc.
determiner:   u, plu, u-la, etc.
prepositions: de, ad, peri, etc.

> The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the

This is not true; Glosa is very dependent on phrase order
within clauses and words within phrases. I would prefer
to force the object to always immediately follow the verb,
and the subject to always immediately precede, though
it may have its own "heavy modifiers" intervening.
In Glosa as in English, light modifiers (the articles,
quantifiers, adjectives) go to the left of the noun,
and heavies go to the right.

Prepositional phrases (and subclauses, treated the same)
must always modify their immediate predecessor. Otherwise
you get "attachment ambiguities" as in English which are
unacceptable in a well-defined syntax. A sentence-initial
prepphrase is "adverbial", modifying the whole sentence,
and a verb-following prepphrase is an "oblique object",
i.e. not a direct object but closely related to the verb.
Lone adverbs can also act as prepositional phrases.
The above scheme could be modified to show that:

sentence: (sentencemodifier) subject predicate
sentencemodifier: prepphrases
sentencemodifier: adverb
predicate: verbphrase (object) (obliques)
object: nounphrase (prepphrases)
obliques: prepphrases

This sort of thing is excellently described in Rick
Morneau's essay on syntax: http://srv.net/~ram/syntax.html

A subject is not always the doer of the verb's action.
It is always the highlighted "star" of the sentence.
Passive voice was invented to enable swapping like this:

"dog bit man"       ... talking mainly about the dog, and subject=doer
"man is bit by dog" ... the man is more important, but object=doer
"man is bitten"     ... there is no doer (agent)
"dog bit            ... there is no doee (patient)

In English it can get confusing and amusing:
"the dog bit the man in the closet/butt."

Other languages would use other patterns, but Glosa is
really a simplified and hopefuly regularized English
syntax with relexed Greco-Latin vocabulary. There can be
but little latitude in the word order without catastrophe.
Ido and Occidental use part-of-speech marking to safely
allow such variation, but that is not the Glosa way.

I think this is the consensus, and most wise.

This is an interesting concept. Is it official? It might

What a refreshing and brilliant idea; I will steal it.
Whatever final vowel comes to mind while speaking or writing
*is* correct. Life is too short for memorization of trivia.

It's not a good idea to send actual pictures

Thinking about core vocabulary some more ... I found this
by searching the Linguist List for "topic dictionary":

http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9512D&L=linguist&P=R4044

Roget's Thesaurus and many other resources were discussed.
Roget's was used by Ron Clark to devise the Glosa vocab,
but the details or methodology are unknown to me.
One of the other items was Steven Glazier's "word menu",
which I bought and find very useful.

I would like to have Glosa vocab categorized in a similar
manner. Any systematic method is good, among other reasons
because it can expose holes or redundancies in the vocabulary.
In an online database (I mean just a simple multicolumn list)
multiple categorizations can be accomodated simultaneously.
For instance, a horse might be "animal; vehicle; food" ...

    According to my anti-spam flter log, today my filters automatically
discarded a message from Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com that was 2263332 bytes long.
I don't know what this was, and I don't really care.  It is extremely
bad internet manners to send such a message to a mailing list
unsolicited.  I hope it will never be done again (although my filters
will just throw it away again).  Some people have limits on the email
they can receive.  Either they cannot receive such monsters at all, or
they may wind up paying additional actual money because of someone
else's thoughtlessness.  The proper way is to make an announcement and
either send it only to those who request or place it on a site from
which it can be fetched.

Yes, I think this sounds like a most excellent way forword.

Also Marcel Springer's sugestion about the "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" word

Warning not to download ones mail is impossible
unless you are going to telephone each one of
us. And then what would we do? The problem is
the sending of picture files or any file that
is quite lengthy... more than 100k. They take
longer to download and there is no way for some
of us to bypass downloading it and read other
mail.

The best solution is never to send such files.
Instead put them on the Web and give an address
where people can visit and see the file if they
wish.

Please keep this in mind... I myself have made
similar mistakes, I'm sure some of us have done
this sort of thing, but we just have to learn
and keep on going.

Subject: [glosalist] a more flexible phrase order
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Sun, 30 Jul 2000 15:13:52 -0700


The recent suggestion to allow noun phrases to float more
freely than permitted by Glosa's strict SVO order, is much too
tempting for this recovering conlanger to resist any longer.
Although it would stretch or break the creoleness of Glosa,
it might happen, if Glosa were to evolve/drift/degenerate
into a natlang in some alternate universe.

First the preposition "per" (or some other, maybe "ex")
would become obligatory in Glosa-2 for marking agent/doer,
as is already allowed marginally in the Glosa of now:

G1:   kani pa morda u andro         ... the usual "active voice"
G1:   andro es ge-morda per kani    ... the less common "passive"

G2e:  per kani pa morda u andro     ... "ergative" becomes mandatory
G2e:  andro pa morda per kani       ... new improved passive, no "es ge-"
G2e:  per kani u andro pa morda     ... SOV etc orders now possible

Meanwhile, a different ("nominative") dialect of Neo-Glosa
marks the object/patient with "em", instead of the agent:

G2n:  pa morda u kani em andro      ... VSO version

Being human, they make war for this or something equally important.
A subtle mixing, as in England the Danes mixed with Anglo-Saxons,
now results. Order is free at last and there is peace for a time:

G3:   in horti per kani em andro pa morda
G3:   pa morda em andro per kani in horti

This demonstrates how the price of free constituent order
is a greatly increased difficulty in parsing (mentally)
even the simplest sentences, exactly as in Esperanto-1.
Cute, though.

No need for major changes, and no need to revise the G-6000.
Only a change in "policy": a word still ought to be spelled
as defined in official references, *but* the final vowels are
merely cosmetic, so variant spellings of finals are "acceptable"
and will not be used to differentiate any new word pairs.
Never tell learners they're "wrong" because of a silly final;
especially since the authors weren't consistent themselves!

The new Net-2500 should carefully select from among the "best" words,
avoiding pairs e.g. bali/bale. Any confusion would dwindle with time;
my guess is that 99% of Glosa users will never even see the G-6000.
So-called "backward compatibility" is a good thing sometimes ...
as long as it doesn't stop progress.

Specialty printing using personal computers is now a lot easier
and higher-quality than it was; I think a good Net-2500 list
can attract a huge new audience, and only a small percentage
of those need to order the nicer (new and old) printed materials
to make it viable.

this might interest Charles. It's about a reasonably standard word order
otherwise Glosa can be difficult to decypher but allows for flexibility of
phrase order. There should be a couple of diagrams but I dropped a clanger
over them and made myself unpopular. Incidentally is there a way of removing
grotty emails from the list? I'm still sruggling to get a web page done - In
AOL is the remote filename the name of a file on my computer or of one on the
web?

sorry about the lapse into English.......

I suggest that to make Glosa clearer and easier to understand, that
A standard Glosa sentence could be looked upon as having 4 phrases:- verb
phrase, and to start with in some sentences, 2 preposition phrases and a noun
phrase, for instance, VP=pa dona, NP=u avi, PP1=a gina and PP2= per andro.
The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the
indirect object PP1 and VP could be at the end. In fact any order would work.
If we all agreed to standardize we could trim the "per" off and have
subjectNP   VP  object  NP and then PP1. I would personally prefer the
symmetry of NP VP NP to either VP NP NP or NP NP VP and I think that
separating the 2 NPs would make the sentence more easily understood. Adding
PP1 at the end would not disturb the symmetry very much. To give variety or
emphasis the order could be varied to NP(old object)u avi VP+"ge"(to signal
the reversal of the positions of object and subject). We now have
possibilities to complete the sentence:- full stop or PP1 or PP2 or both PP1
and PP2 in either order (the English passive can be very useful). The "ge" is
derived from the word "gene" and, as far as I can see could be said to have
little to do with the "ge-" of German.
In Glosa, a phrase seems to have 3 parts, an introductory small word (IW) at
the beginning, the head word (HW) at the end and various bits of adjectival
or adverbial gubbins in the middle(MG).
U + alti + andro. HW is usually followed by IW of the next phrase. Where this
is so, it is easy to distinguish the phrases and IW identifies the phrase's
function. NP, PP,VP etc. The IP of NP could be "u", "plu", "multi" or a
numeral, of VP, "pa", "fu", "du" etc. I personally would like an IP for the
present tense i.e. "pres" or "pi" for present indicative. The IP of a PP
would be a preposition and, as this will be followed by a NP, the word "u"
could be amalgamated into the prep and be omitted .
Adjectival gubbins would need to be in the apropriate NP or it would be
difficult which NP was being gubbinized . On the other hand, as there is only
1 VP an adverbial gubbins could be more or less anywhere and being placed
away from the VP would shorten and simplify the actual sentence.

The order NP  VP  NP PP seems to be the norm as Glosa was initially developed
in England but other orders could be acceptable if it were clear what was to
follow.
(u orto glosa-V--)
u alti andro pa gentili dona plu pusi avi a kali gina.
(glosa neo u---V)
avi pusi plu gina kali a andro alti u dona gentili.        Present tense
implied
(glosa u neo V----)
dona gentili pri gina a kali andro per alti avi plu pusi    pri=present tense
(u orta glosa)
u alto andro du gentila dona plu pusi avi a kala gina. I like this one -
rhyming phrasesâ¦â¦.

The Europeano site mentioned above is mine.
I never would have described Interlingua de 
Peano as a forerunner of Glosa, but I guess in
some ways that may be accurate. Of course 
Interglossa is the actual forerunner of Glosa,
and the ideas that went into putting together
Interglossa were developed out of an appreciation
for the simplicity found in Interlingua and the
thought that the internationality of Greek roots
was a common feature of the scientific vocabulary
in actual use in many modern languages. 

I say the site is mine since I'm the one who for
the most part put it together. John has moved to
Ohio and sends me a message once in a while,
Jon and Umberto have gone over to the new
Interlingua (of IALA, as I have, but I see IALA's
work a direct descendant of Peano's language,
as well as Liptay, and Lott's). The site is in need
of an update; there sure are a lot of people that 
visit it and send email to europeano{at}geocities{dot}com
which get sent to John and he bounces them back
to me. However, the thought that Interlingua de
Peano was a forerunner of Glosa has never been
a topic of any inquiries into that site's email.

Hmm? But an interesting idea nonetheless...

Since,
Jay B.

Sticking to plain ascii, no frills, better for communications
sake... if you need to highlight use CAPS with care, and
"quotes" or _underscore_ for emphasis... seems quite a
good solution to me.

With so many synonyms having a Greek and a Latin
root it would be an interesting project to separate these
into two wordlists. One having Greek roots. The other
having Latin roots. Then comparing texts in each of the
two alternatives and getting feedback on the two.

What say ye?

*   Seems a lovely idea: reminds me of the time Haitao was wrting to me in
Esperanto (at his own request), and I had to translate the Espo into
English before I - using Glosa - could respond to his posts.
    If there wasn't a full-scale Revolution going on - out there - in the
real world, I could possibly enjoy _babbling_ with the bablos; such
pleasure is, I fear, denied me by the fact that very soon there might not
be an outside world - as we know it - to allow me the esoteric luxury of
being totally confused by the cacophany of auxiliary voices.

I'll have to give it a miss until after 2012,

*   So, if a language has a minor degree of redundancy, this could be a
good thing for learners.  I agree.  Glosa was designed to have virtually no
redundancy, but a little snuck in.  This made it more 'human' and less rigid.

*   As a one-time teacher, I can confirm this difference: tell the kids
that the words differ simply by an "X" and a "Y" then you are asking for
trouble; you are triggering them for error.  Glosa's no inflection policy
does make the modifying particles much easier to recognise and remember.
    What's more, PA, DU, FU and NU all feature a distinctively different
consonant.  I have always thought of it as a ''Meccano'' language, and have
found it as easy to construct, because the bits look and sound so different.

*   Wrong guess!
    When the neophyte speaks an analytical languasge, he can always pause
.. to gather his thoughts .. between words; but, when using the
agglutinative, synthetic-type language, he feels like an idiot pausing
once, or twice, during the delivery of one, highly inflected word!

    English will never be reformed, or have usages banished.
    Using English 'inflections' as "words" is senseless, because they
developed into their present form over a long period, and do not make sense 
in this "analytic" form.  What's more the syntax analysis used in
Functional Grammar makes more sense than your attempt, here.

*   My researches come to the conclusion that although there seems an
endless variation in the way we can use English, this is not so, and each
of the possible alternatives has its own feel for 'the proper syntax.'
    The better, published writers all tend to use the same set of syntax
rules.
    Glosa has a reasonably well defined set of syntax rules, too; however,
it has been designed to offer less variation in the turn of phrase.

>To put it another way:  The anta move finger as write and after

>
*   As "He runs," can be little else than a present statement, ~An kurso,~
is also a clear-cut present tense statement.  It is just the bare
Infinitive form.
    As, again, in English, we can stress the actual moment of the present,
so too, in Glosa, we can extend, or modify, the meaning of the present:-
 EG   He is running now.   -->  An du nu kurso.
                            continues now to run
No sweat. No inflection. Simple pre-particles lead us into the VERB. 
    This idea, of having the substantive word at the end of the phrase, is
called Head Final structure; and, in Glosa, it applies to both Noun Phrases
and Verb Phrases.  With a reasonably well-defined heirarchy of function
words leading up to the final substantive word, this gives Glosa a clearly
distinctive, and readily recognisable, phrasal structure.   
    For the reason of demarking phrase and clause boundaries, punctuation,
in Glosa, has grammatical signiificance.  And I hasten to add, that in
non-seen, spoken utterance, the very same boundaries are denoted by vocal
inflection. 
    I send this posting in an attempt to say that the transcription of
idiomatic English does NOT make Glosa.

    On turning the coin over, we do find that good Glosa does, for the most
part, transcribe into grammatically correct English; and, without pushing
the comparison too far, well-written, literal English usually does 
transcribe into good Glosa. 

    Over recent years my English writing style has been improving.
Although this could be a simple case of ^try, try again,^ I tend to relate
the recent thinking I apply to the turning of my English-language phrases, 
to the mental effort that I have been putting into improving my Glosa.
    So, Glosa could be good for you.

Saluta,
  Robin
    P.S.  The idea of Head Final structure is spelt out with Glosa examples
in the attachd Seminar #1.   R.

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

    However, there are patterns in common in English and the other more
successful national languages: we are still struggling with the idea of a
"Universal Grammar."

    The Intelingua people back-slid.

*   Though I have not understood you perfectly, I would say that both
inflected and non-inflected languages incorporate the same functions, but,
physically, achieve them differently.
    And although I have not studied it, I do understand that Signed
Language is also "inflected", and this is developed, naturally, by young
people using the standard Signs.  So, a tendency towards inflection 'could'
be a part of the universal language story.
    In terms of the tense inflections of VERBS, Glosa achieves this quite
well with particles.  Some other aspects are achieved with separate words,
such as the conditionality of ~sio~.

*   As I explained in an earlier post, the Passiive Voice arrived late in
Glosa's development, and the authors decided the neatest way of adding it
was by invoking a participle.  Thus GENE -> GE- was born.
    And, yes, purists label this as an "inflection."  Work it out for
yourself: if the "-en" of "woken" and the "-ed" of "chased" in ..
"I was woken and chased by a wild bull," are ''inflections'' then so is the
~ge-~ of ~ge-leve~ in ~An gene ge-leve per u fo soni explode.~
    So, why, you might ask, is it hyphenated?  Because, in Glosa,
pronunciation is with the penultimate vowel (or the final vowel, if there
is only one), thus ~geleve~ and ~ge-leve~ sound different; and, for
practical purposes, might be quite different words!

>Entire avoidance of morphological change in derivation is more

*   This is a true problem: in some cases we have such derivations built
in, as in ~kapitala~ [capital] and ~kapitalismo~ [capitalism] plus
~sociali~ and ~socialismo~; but if you were to derive a new word, I would
ask you to hyphenate. 
 EG   sustine   -   sustain
      sustin-abili   -   sustainable
      sustin-abili-ra   -   sustainability
  <Yes, I did look it up in the Latin dictionary.  It was not as
fashionable a decade ago, when the Glosa 6000 was put together, as it is 
now.  It IS our responsibility to keep the Glosa lexicon current.>

   Linguistically the hyphens are necessary both as a guide to
pronunciation and derivation; and they seem part of the language.  Were I
to write ~sustinabilira~ the word would look undecipherable, and the stress
of pronunciation would be on the penultimate "I" which is NOT stressed in
the pronunciation of the correctly derived, compound word.

*   If we need rules they are the simple pragmatic rules of combining
pronunciation with the excision of unwanted terminal vowels, combined with
hyphenation.  However, Glosa will be used in context, as is English, so the
sorts of problems, above, will be substantially the same for Glosa as they
are for English.

*   As I see it the hyphens are the ^trainer wheels.^
    However, there are two basic forms of Glosa, the highly elided, and the
completely unelided: beginners would learn the language better, by, at the
start, throwing everything in,  EG
   An age vagona.   ...  He drove.    He drives.    He drives the car.
   [he drive (the car)]

   Un andra pa age u vagona.   ...   The man drove the car.
  [the man did drive the car]

    While Ron Clark had a preference for the Greek roots, I try to remain
neutral in this; however, I do definitely enjoy the availability, in the
broader application of the language, of a prime word from one Classical
source, and a synonym from the other.

That's probably not fair (or too fair) to Ron Clark.  Wasn't the
inclusion of Greek roots a key part of the vision of Bodmer/
Hogben?

One of their arguments, I think, was that it would assist the
inclusion of scientific words in the future language.

Some other IALs have chosen roots from the languages most largely
spoken in Europe this (20th) century.  What is most common among
them often turns out to have come from Latin (because of the
combined weight of English and the romance languages), so they get
about the same outcome as the Interlingua policy of taking direct
from Latin.

But also, since science coinings are generally international, and
often Greek-based, that approach of taking from modern languages
seems to achieve the objective that was hoped to come from
directly Greek-based roots.

I Didn't can reciev your message because Syd's message was too big.

the best way to understand the meanings of the words, and for

Sea Mail.

>One piece of curiosity: when you write in English and in Glosa, do you

Marcel's sample of English words beginning in RO:

roam, roar, roast, rob, robe, robot, robin,
rock, rocket, rod, rogue, roll, romance,
roof, room, root, rope, rose, rot,
rough, round, rouse, route, routine,
rove, row boat, row, royal

Kilgariff's words in RO:

road n
roar v
rob v, robbery n
rock n
rock v
rocket n
rod n
role n
roll n
roll v
romance n, romantic a
roof n
room n
root n, root v
rope n
rose n
rotation n
rotten a
rough a, roughly adv
round a, round adv, round n, round prep, round v
route n
routine n
row n
row v
royal a, royalty n

So by my rough count, the M-list includes 19 of 25 K-items.
This approximates a good practical word list for English-Glosa.

We could be sure that if the K-list were fully equivalenced,
there would be *no* *holes* in the Glosa vocabulary, because
the BNC is the largest corpus of English ever assembled,
and the K-list covers over 90% of word usage by frequency.
Yet, this requires much less than 6000 Glosa roots.
No other auxlang/IAL has accomplished this sort of
systematic validation of its vocabulary.

I already commented about word order, basically
you have to be very careful and can't change
very much without breaking it, except that you can
often move prepositional phrases around a bit,
but even there you can get ambiguity as to what
the preposition attaches to:

If "I shot the dog in the forest", what exactly
was in the forest? Several possibilities.
English is rife with attachment ambiguities.
But in Glosa I expect "in" to modify only "dog".

I do think a new direct object preposition "em" would
nicely accomplish much of what you suggest, though.
And indirect object should *never* lack a preposition.
Then you could freely move the "per/ad/em" phrases.
Then, the only safe place for adverbial phrases would
be the very front or immediately following the verb.
And it's already mostly like that, so why not?

Then I have some good news for you! Standard Glosa uses ~nu~ to mark the

As a teacher of foreign languages to English
speakers I can truly say that American (or other
wise native English speakers) can and do 
pronounce vowels well enough to be totally
and thoroughly comprehensible to native
speakers of languages that have clear sounding
final vowels. 

And also...

One of the reasons why Spanish is very
comprehensible to Portuguese speakers 
is the clarity of the vowels as opposed to
the other case where Portuguese is hard
for Speakers of Spanish who are not 
used to the long and short vowels of
Portuguese... eg. "casa" as "kah-zuh"
instead of "kah-sah" etc. To many Spanish
speakers the Brazilian variety is a lot more
comprehensible than the Portuguese 
mainland accent or the Azorean accent
one finds in the U.S. on the East Coast
quite often.

To use unstressed vowels in an IAL is
a big mistake in my opinion, since they
add nothing to the recognizability of words
and add a lot to their being hard to master.

Glosa is not Volapuk, and the umlauted
sort of sounds although easy for an Anglo
or German speaker are not so for others.

As to whether English is the most successful
auxiliary language... this is true, but on the
other hand it is also lots of fun to communicate
in something else. "Glosaists have more fun!"
Now if we could come up with a way to 
convince everyone of this we'd have an easy
time wouldn't we?

Since,
Jay B.

This is just plain silly. The majority of Spanish common nouns
are combinations of two syllables, having the accent on the
first syllable. This does not imply that the second syllable is
in anyway obscured or made into a schewa sound. Not at all!

Get a new clue on this one Carlitos, :-)))

~panto~ is "all" when there is a group of things being talked about [alle].
~Panto fito nece gene foto.~

~holo~ is "all" when there is one thing and you are talking about the whole
thing [ganz, all]. ~Mi vora (un) holo plaka.~

~singu~ is for when some things are distributed among a number of other
things [jede]. ~Singu manu habe penta digi~

~hekasto~ I guess, is a synonym for ~panto~


I agree that "any" and "some" should not be distinguished, so ~ali~ and
~uno~ can be synonyms

Perhaps, since there is so little time left, he should embrace a
more self-satisfied IAL, one that already has a following that is
just using the damn thing.  You are standing on the edge of the
abyss and the earth is crumbling under your feet, and the people
around you are remarking on the phenomenon, most in Esperanto,
some in Interlingua or Ido.  How important is it that Glosa has
the future potential to be better than any of them, if there will
be no future?

Mailing lists using IALs, unfortunately most in Esperanto, exist
already for such things as global pollution, the extinction of
species, and global economic conspiracies and strategies.

Or perhaps the imminent event is eschatological.

I was thinking about the GEO-leaflet "History behind Glosa", GEO, 
Richmond, 1996. 

Just a wish: 
It would be great if you would speak a Glosa text on a learner's 
cassette some day.  Then Robin could distribute it with his one. The 
existing cassette of Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark ("Introducing 
Euro-Glosa Cassette", GEO, Richmond 1990) has a strong, English 
accent, unacceptable for a learning material.  You as a Spanish 
teacher would be the best speaker we can get.

Funny, Charles, I played around with some statistics, too.  Perhaps 
I was inspired by your previous mails. 

I took out my old school book ("Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz Englisch", 
Klett Vl., Stuttgart 1977).  It goes back to "General Service List of 
English Words" by Michael West, 1953.  Charles, do you know this list? 
Who is "better", West or Kilgariff?  The book contains 
"Grund"-vocabulary 2000 words that should enable a text understanding 
of 85 % and "Aufbau", another 2500 words, should enable to 95 %.  The 
small list "roam ... royal" from "E5000 G1000" contains all of "Grund" 
(except "road" and "ring" (sound)) and most of "Aufbau".  So 
"English 5000 to Glosa 1000" can be estimated near to 90 %.  

Could it be, that ye ole, silly Glosa 1000, so much shouted at by us 
here in Glosalist, is not so bad? 

If so, or nearly so, we could: 
- Take Bill Patterson's dictionary 
    (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) and 
- put in "English 5000 to Glosa 1000". 
    (Unfortunately printing quality of the "Central Glosa" book is so 
    bad, that scanning and OCR-text recognition fails.) 
- Make again 3 levels: "Literary" with all words, "Base" without 
    synonyms, but this time prefer Glosa 1000 words (of course 
    without hidri/aqa, kron/tem, hipo/sub ...) and "Core" for 
    the most useful words, chosen with help of Kilgariff or similar.
Then:
- Create missing words, if needed. 
- Fix errors I mentioned 00-07-28.
- Contact Wendy. 
- Solve the bad synonym problem (karo/kara, silva/silvi ...) and other 
    ending vowel problems (krisi (crisis)/ kriso (golden)). 
- Refine the vocabulary by comparison with other Romanic languages, 
    other world languages and other IALs. 
- Discuss the results in Glosalist. 
- Translate the dictionary into French, German, Russian, Spain, ... 
- Test out the vocabulary by practical use: communication, 
    translations, writing literature. 

A long way.  But quickly a status can be reached that is better than 
the current.

It has been a while since I posted the BNC URLs,

The BNC. It is more recent, much larger and more systematic.
There is an honored tradition from Thordike to West and
the Longman's dictionary to the BNC. But, we can use *multiple*
resources, even other auxlang lists such as Ido/Novial/Occidental.

I think the Glosa-1800 (by my count) is pretty bad,
and the Glosa-6000 not very much better.

Yes!

Yes yes yes.

The bad ones are bali/bale, different words with similar roots.
The ones like silva/silvi, same word spelled slightly different,
are a much easier thing to fix. Yes, we should fix them for the
new list, i.e. not include both bale/bali, and spell silva with -a.

Yes, that will take some time of course.

With several or many people helping, it can all be accomplished.

Note: there is a distinction between ~kron~ [instant] and ~tem~ [period].

~Mi vo vide an; kron an veni~  [I want to see him, when he comes]   i.e. at
the moment of his arrival

~Mi vo vide an; tem an veni~  [I want to see him, while he comes]   i.e.
during his journey

~Mi pa es to kolegi tem mo horo~ [I was at college for one hour]

~Mi pa es lo rura kron mo horo~ [I was in the country-side at one o'clock]

Note the similar distinction between ~lo~,~loka~ [a place] (i.e. space
extended) and ~to~,~topo~ [a spot] (i.e. space restricted)

Sounds like we have a good way forward.

Subject: [glosalist] final vowels
From: "John Schilke" <doc{at}clacknet{dot}com>
Date: Tue, 1 Aug 2000 12:36:32 -0700

Greetings to all on the List!

I have been lurking and plan to continue to do so, since most of the summer
has been taken up with long-overdue travel.  Nonetheless, Ihave been
enjoying saving the recent discussions to re-read them.  In particular, I,
too, have been nonplussed by the problem of remembering the final vowels for
many words.

A suggestion, designed to stimulate comment rather than immediate
acceptance:  why not make the Glosa word really the "root" and leave the
final vowel to be chosen for euphony, personal preference, or even as a way
of demonstrating some attitude the speaker/writer may have towards the
utterance (truthfulness, value, agreement, emotion, etc.)?

Saluta ad panto-pe!

Well, this would be a radical change for
Glosa and it would be a different enough
language to signify a major revision or
a new language project, I would think.

Since,

My guess is that English-speakers will only pronounce
-i -a -o decently. And it won't hurt anything at all.
Pick the most plausible etymological vowel and schwa it.

But the Ido speakers might faithfully carry over their
-a for adjectives, -o for nouns, -e for adverbs. Beware,
they will try -i for plurals too! (I formerly urged the use
of part-of-speech marking for Glosa, but not anymore.)

It could be a lot of fun, actually, to watch it evolve.
Final vowels as fashion accessories?

That is the usual "unmarked" order, where the subject N
is the same as the agent/doer/causer role, and it matches
temporal cause-effect order as well, very useful.

Now, trying to imagine a conversation, ...
"An pa dona avi a qo-pe?" ... "A gina."
The examples in the reference seem to forbid these:
"A GINA an dona un avi." "A GINA un andro dona un avi."
Glosa doesn't invert word order for questions, either.

But not many languages forbid "fronting" for topicalization,
which is almost inevitable. One might try something like this
to emphasize the agent/doer: "PER ANDRO, gina pa gene un avi".

Ido uses "na" as a preposition for the direct object,
Otto Jesperson recommended "em" as an improvement.
With this there's much less need for clumsy passives,
and one annoying/superfluous article can be dropped;
"EM AVI un andro pa dona a gina."

So using PER/AD/EM seems to allow more flexibility and
expressiveness, at the usual cost of complexity. But maybe
removal or avoidance of passives makes it worthwhile?
The idea (originally Syd's, IIRC) seems attractive.

A popular idea in linguistic analysis called "optimality"
describes the tendency of language to balance certain goals
against others; the agent/doer tends to the front/left of the
sentence, competing in vain against a topicalized phrase,
which has higher precedence, but the agent out-competes
objects (unless they get topicalized).

Earlier-in-time is generally front/left-ward of later, so
most (95%) languages are SO rather than OS. Similar forces
lead to either prepositions and VO, or inflections and OV.
The only odd thing about Glosa is its adjective-noun order,
which tends (but not strongly) to go with OV languages.

Anyway, if fronting is to be allowed then we will need "em".

I don't know whether I'm saying anything new to most people here,
but I recently noticed the Radio Australia Tok Pisin service at
http://www.abc.net.au/ra/newsratp/.  A large resource.

Tok Pisin does seem to be a pidgin rather than a
language.  I.e. what you see is English with simplified grammar
assisted by a characteristic idiom that heavily depends on
"bilong" (belong) and "long" (alongside, I think, a legacy, as
Charles suggests, of contact with sailors).  And a simplified
phonetic spelling which largely emulates the pronunciations of
Australian English.

I'm still not persuaded that pidgins are a way forward for an
international language.  One problem is that an opportunistic
dialect cannot be systematic.  Perhaps it is not really true that
the grammar is simple, but rather that it snatches phrases from
the parent language, and the possible phrases in that language are
determined by a grammar which may be complex.

Michael Talbot-Wilson

This is true; a random pidgin/creole needs much more
systemizing before it can serve as a global interlanguage.
Perhaps a better example would be Bahasa Indonesia,
which has served as a regional IAL, though still not
(perhaps) systematic enough for global use. But we should
learn what we can from these two examples; Glosa is
the only well-known IAL with a grammar of this type.

An isolating language *can* be as systematic as desired.
I think Glosa can be improved "merely" by reforming its
vocabulary, whereas other IALs are not so easily reformed,
judging by past history. I do believe that less grammar
is for the best, and there is hope for this approach.
>From what I have seen on other lists, other grammars

We need something much simpler for a real-world IAL.

But I'd like to hear more about what would constitute
"systematic", specifically. The Ido suffixes are not
so scientific as claimed, and certainly agglutination
is not going to win over the masses of the world.
I have several ideas on this, but nothing definitive.
The key is that vocabulary is flexible, grammar is stiff.

A somewhat daring claim, since "other grammars" are used
exclusively in their mailing lists (though admittedly, perhaps, by
the enthusiatic few), when that can't be said for Glosa.  Ido, you
say?  No-one writes in English to the Ido list.  If they did, they
would not be understood by several people who freely engage in
discussions there, especially the French and the Russians.

It's probably true of Ido, though, as of anything else, that many
people don't "fully" master it.  But people who have been learning
it for a day *say* things.

> But I'd like to hear more about what would constitute

Hmm...  Don't know how scientific they are claimed to be.  The
language strikes me as (as it were) a kind of compromise arrived
at by a very gifted committee.  I sense a kind of moderation, as
though principles, good in themselves, had not been pushed to
extremes.  It may well be that it is therefore unscientific.  
Perhaps it is artistic.

However, this is a Glosa list.  What I (instant expert) suggested
about Tok Pisin is that it is undefined, that it perpetually
shadows English.  (In part that is an unfair comparison.  English
is also undefined.  But it has been satisfactorily described, and
the description is autonomous.)

Being systematic, perhaps, means having an autonomous grammar.  
When talking about IALs, being systematic also means that the
grammar is well-defined, and perhaps completely defined.  Even if
it supposedly has no grammar, there is a predefined way, for
example, to signify number.  But that's not totally satisfactory.  
There is a prefined way (with "wanpela") to do that in Tok Pisin.

So don't press me too far on "systematic".  I mean something, or
it means something to me, but I'll leave it at that.

Michael Talbot-Wilson

What I meant by Tok Pisin (and presumably pidgins in general)
being unsystematic was that, if it takes a phrase from the parent
language opportunistically, the phraseology is not derived from
any system within the language.  

For example, when the Australian media are blathering at length
about (Fiji) "coup leader George Speight", and then we see "ku
lida George Speight" on the Tok Pisin site, does the phrase "ku
lida" conform to the pattern of the language, and did its separate
words even exist in the language (the pidgin) prior to this story
making the news?  I don't claim to certainly know the answer, I'm
just using this example to trigger some guesses.

Could "ku lida" be generated within Tok Pisin, or could it only
arise because that expression became newsworthy in English?  In
the event that an independent Tok Pisin site had been first to
market with the news of the coup d'état, could the expression "ku
lida George Speight" have been used by it from the first?

I'm suggesting that if the language is imitative to a high degree,
the phrase does not arise in accordance with any system within it.

    It is possible to find that in both English and Glosa, the story
snowballs from the first word of the sentence to the last.  All along the
line, words in front modify the next, and so on.

    The Greek alphabet causes me to bog down every time: there is no direct
transliteration between the Roman alphabet and the Greek!

    I'm sure that a small number of 'rules of thumb' could be devised to
source the Greek dictionary for suitable roots to add to the Glosa lexicon,
but I would bet that there is no formula.

    What Ron Clark liked about the Greek lexicon was iits flexibility: the
words were redily compounded to form more complex concepts.

*   There is an answer to this question, and it is fairly simple: most of
us speak normal English, and if that was what we used on the Glosalist,
then we could have a majority of news and ideas in Glosa.
    But there IS a 'language about language' and this is what Linguists
speak.  And many on the Glosalist want to talk Linguistically about Glosa:
such discussions do not work in the everyday language of pedestrians.

*   Glosa was never meant to be a set piece, and, as a language of science,

    I do, however have a formula for deriving new words for the Glosa
lexicon.  I look u the Langensheidt _Shorter Latin Dictionary_ by feeding
in the English word into the back half, and get a range of likely-looking
Latin words.  From these I mentally shorten the words to suitable lengths
so that they look like Glosa words; then I check out my short-list of the
words in the front of the dictionary to see iif they hold the meaning and
suitable formin the Latin to English section.  When I have narrowed down my
selection, I look in Glosa 6000 to see that there is a linguistic space to
accommodate the new word, IE it doesn't look too close to an existing Glosa
word.  Then I write mu newly coined Glosa word into the "6000".
    Acase in point occurred when I sought the Glosa word for "employment" 
in "6000".  There was no entry covering it, and when I did my search in the
Latin Dictionary, the result, after rounding, was ~utor~.  This word was
close to ~uti~ for "use", but far enough away to be distinctive.

Joe, I used a gambling term here because I see the various auxlangs  (and
auxlang groups) as sitting around a gambling pit each throwing in their
bids, and each wishing the win the pot of gold that will come with IAL
Selection.

   Back to reality, when gambling on cards, often the stakes in the middle
of the table build up as no-one wins the hands.  This necessitates putting
the money into a container, possibly a "pot" to stop the coins from
spilling out into the playing area.  Hence the use of the term "jack-pot"
to cover the large amount of money that has been steadily building up,
waiting for a winner to "scoop the pot"

   It has long been my understanding that Country Australians enjoy using
colourful language and the telling of tall tales.  It is also a part of the
alure of Australia for me.  

   However, there could be a loss of enjoyment in the act of communication
if the adopted IAL has no scope for idiomatic and metaphorical usages. So,
as the result of a discussion a couple of years ago on the Conlang List, I
decided that we ought to be able to use colourful language in our
international communications, as long as we marked them as such, using a
symbol to denote the use of non-literal language.

   Shortening the story, I now might describe heavy rain, by saying, "It's
raining ^cats and dogs^."

   In the gamble for IAL status, perhaps Glosa will ^scoop the pot.^

Saluta, 
  Robin

    Ron Clark declared ~de~ to be the #multipurpose# preposition in Glosa.
So, when you were telling a story, requiring a preposition, butyou didn't
know which, then the odds were that it would be ~de~.  Wher I want to
indicate the 'infinitive, but don't feel that ~te~ is correct, I use ~de~.

auxiliary languages improving efficiency in the market-place of ideas.
    And on the question of standardisation, I would use a different
analogy.  During my Secondary Schooling, the MKS system of Physical Units
was adopted: life was much more straightforward after this, by contrast
with the mixed systems of units that existed before-hand.

Saluta,

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

                     G-ASCII Analysed Syntax (GAS)        File:syntanal.gas
                     -----------------------------             R. Gaskell
            <A system for analysing sentences written in a       Oct `95
                language that uses Syntax-based Grammar>

Rationale
        Perhaps it is possible to analyse the structure of a sentence by
looking at the function of the words - but replacing the words with symbols
that represent their function, to allow us to perceive this structure in
its abstract form.
        Since languages whose grammar is based on word order, and in which
the words do not change according to their function .. where "verbs" are not
inflected, and parts of speech are not marked .. there is a case for finding
a way of noting this sequence of word-functions.  Glosa is a language with
this form of grammar, which can be described as "Syntax-based."
N.B. English grammar is a hybrid, half of which is syntax-based, e.g. _Dog
bites man._ _Man bites dog._
        In analysing the style of usage for a language that has syntax-
based grammar, superior usage styles will demonstrate particular syntactic
patterns: the replacement of words with abstract symbols will make these
patterns much more readily recognised.
        When teaching the use of a language that has syntax-based grammar,
a system of symbols that represent the syntactic functions will allow
instruction at the abstract level.  Whereas children absorb grammar
intuitively, and build their own mental grammar subconsciously, this method
is more suitable for adult learners, who have usually lost the mental
plasticity they had when children, and who rely for their learning on
conscious, intellectual processes.  In short, adults learn through applying
principles, while children use the natural, unconscious method.  A system,
that allowed adults to perceive the principles of good syntax-based usage,
seemed worth developing.

An Unwritten Grammar
        Glosa is one of the few fully-formed languages that is taught
without the aid of a grammar book.
        The authors, Ronald Clark and Wendy Ashby, have avoided attempting
to tabulate the grammar of Glosa, suggesting that the language relies on
our inherent linguistic ability, and that a "formal" grammar would restrict
the use of the language.  This seems to be true; there is also the thought
that writing a grammar to describe the language of thought would be
difficult, if not impossible.
        People, who have retained some of their child-like flexibility of
mind, can intuit the grammar of Glosa, building a mental grammar for it, in
their heads.  Children learn Glosa very readily, because with its standard-
ised syntax there are few rules of usage, and these can be absorbed easily.

Syntax in the Abstract
        Although not wishing to try to write a "Gramatika," I thought an
abstract representation of Glosa syntax would be in order.  Then I started
looking around for suitable symbols to represent these syntactic functions.
While casually looking at a book on meaning representation, I noticed that
it was full of pseudo-algebraic formulations: I realised that most of these
symbols would not transmit through the Internet as e-mail; it would be
silly to use such symbols for a syntactic analysis, so I looked for
something simpler.
        On looking down at the keyboard of my computer, I found the answer:
I should obviously use ASCII symbols!  So, GAS was born - G-ASCII Analysed
Syntax: I started out awarding a different non-alphanumeric symbol to each
new syntactic function I found as I analysed Glosa text.  But, this way, I
was soon to run out of keyboard symbols.
        Becoming systematic, I wondered how many syntactic functions there
were: this was reminiscent of an earlier question about the number of types
of verbs and nouns.  We would need a rational number of syntactic
categories: not so many it was unworkable; and not so few it was meaning-
less.  Then I started to count the symbols on my 101 key keyboard: there
were the normal 26 letters, each with upper and lower case versions; then
there were the 10 numbers; and after that, I counted 32 non-alphanumeric
symbols.

        I decided it would be nice if the syntactic categories could be
restricted to this last group of 32 symbols, so they wouldn't get mixed up
with the normal text.  But, already, I had got up to 38 syntactic
categories, each of which had been awarded a symbol, plus I had another
seven categories represented as two-symbol compounds: this yielded a total of
45 syntactic categories.  I wondered if this was too many, and if I would
have to slim it down a bit.

        Here is the first attempt to put it all together:-

> A somewhat daring claim, since "other grammars" are used
> exclusively in their mailing lists

I was on some Ido lists for a year or two, and though
the people (those visible) did use Ido, the level of
attainment was poor in all but 2 or 3 cases. I don't
intend to blame either the people or the language,
both were admirable, but this (Ido) isn't sufficiently
easy to serve as a truly global auxiliary language.
Even among Europeans the failure rate is too high,
how much worse among non-Euros? So I turned to the
more simplified grammar of Glosa, and found that it has
too many sharp edges about it, but that it should be
easy to reform, by a careful selection of vocabulary.

> It's probably true of Ido, though, as of anything else, that many
> people don't "fully" master it.  But people who have been learning

Yes, and Ido was a giant step forward. I am convinced though
(and so was Otto Jesperson) that Occidental went another
giant step forward beyond Ido, keeping its strengths and
reducing its weaknesses. However, I am thinking that perhaps
OCC is best seen as a regional IAL, for those who already
speak a European language. Current research seems to suggest
that only an analytic/isolating language can ever hope to be
an effective global (not regional) auxiliary. My criterion
is that 90% of the adults who attempt to learn it,
must *succeed* (rather than 90% failure as it is today).

Ido made heavy claims in this area, and these were IMO fully
*justified* at the time (1907 through 1910). The leading
theorist was Couturat, a mathematician of perhaps questionable
character, but other respected scientists such as Jesperson
played important roles. There is a wealth of information
available in James Chandler's web pages. But it was clear
to most interlinguists in the 1920's that Occidental was
far more advanced, so Ido lost most of its adherents.

It is partly unfair, but the issue is really Glosa not TP.
You gave a good example about "ku lida"; that sort of thing
must be avoided, agreed. Glosa can be more systematic than that.

> Being systematic, perhaps, means having an autonomous grammar.
> When talking about IALs, being systematic also means that the
> grammar is well-defined, and perhaps completely defined.

As with Beaufront's Ido grammar. OK, I agree that Glosa needs
better definition than it has today. But people familiar with
creoles already know this pattern, which is extremely simple,
and maximally so. Creoles have been unfairly reviled; they're
as expressive and precise as any other human languages
(what they now term "pidgins" are something less than that).

> So don't press me too far on "systematic".  I mean something, or
> it means something to me, but I'll leave it at that.

Sorry to press, but it would be useful information.
Here are some of my concerns for truly systematic Glosa:

What are the equivalent Glosa idioms for the Ido suffixes?
Same for the top 100 words by frequency in English?
What are the semantic fields, corresponding with Roget's 1000?
Are there adequate meronyms for each category?
How is the genitive expressed, in all situations?
How are participles, if any, to be used?
How many and which verbs can act as auxiliaries?
How are determiners/quantifiers to be used?

Now I feel like venting some complaints, which is always fun:

Why are there so $#@! many short words that look
like particles but aren't, and long words that are?

Why is the principle of grammatical isolation abandoned
in a few cases? Inconsistency is inexcusable in an IAL.

Why isn't pure compounding used in the clumsy
anti-mnemonic "-BO -PE" series?

Why not jettison the ugly Greek roots altogether,
keeping only roots that appear in both English and Latin?

Should there be any participles or not?
Just one is plainly wrong, should be 0 or 2.

    Thanks for the clarification.  This I can go with.

    If one is going to learn Glosa (or any other language, for that
matter) by paradigmatic examples rather than by formal exposition,
then, yes, I think there needs to be more connected text.  As for the
listening, for many of us, at the beginning, at least, most use of an
IAL will be through writing and reading.  I think there should be both
approaches, paradigmatic material and formal exposition.  Without at
least some of the latter, a lot of people are not going to take Glosa
seriously.

    There is the matter, which has been brought up before, of teaching
materials.  As I have claimed earlier, I think that it *is* possible to
make a good start on a language like Glosa with a booklet containing
examples and wordlists, just a little more ample than the existing
G.E.O. materials.

    (Although this is a side issue, I would actually agree.  I have
long been in favor of the Metric System, as we call MKS here in
Yankee-dom.  In fact, it has been *legal* to use it here in the US 
for over a century -- it is just not required.  Winess the nonsense
that if I buy a liter of imported olive oil, it is marked both as a
liter and as 33.8 US fluid ounces, which is stupid, considering that 
it would be fully legal to mark it as one liter and leave it at that.)

    *** Incidentally, I thought it was very worthwhile to reproduce
Wendy Ashby's letter the other day.  It was a good example of what the
language is capable of.  Unfortunately, I pruned my mailboxes too
vigorously and did away with it.

    I concur.  I think that the structure of the language is
satisfactory, "good enough" in the phrase associated with me, as it is. 
All that it really needs is more judicious use of vocabulary material
WHICH ALREADY EXISTS.  As those who follow the AUXLANG list will know,
I think that the quest for greater "perfection" in a constructed IAL is
in vain and may even be counterproductive.  One person's necessary
feature is another person's fundamental flaw.  A feature that is easy
to one person is difficult to another, whereas a different feature is
easy to the second and difficult to the first.  And so on and on and
on.  I doubt that it is practically feasible to devise some language
worth using which in all particulars will be equally "easy" to
everybody.  As far as I am concerned, the way Glosa is built is
adequate.  All that it really needs is some sprucing up in vocabulary
selection.

    I think that I pressed the wrong key and wiped out a message I
intended to send to the list.  If in fact it shows up, please pardon
the repetition.

    I was responding to Charles, who said that inconsistency is
inexcusable in an IAL.  I do not entirely agree.  Auxiliary language
design involves a lot of trade-offs due to competing values.  It may
not be completely possible to satisfy all desiderata simultaneously. 
Something may have to give way at times, and in the process what seems
to be an "inconsistency" may be allowable in order to accomplish
something else.  I do not have a specific example in mind, only that 
do not completely agree with Charles on this point.

    There is also an esthetic element, although this aspect is
notoriously slippery.  I myself am not especially enamored of
Esperanto, but some people have called it a work of art.  J.R.R.
Tolkien referred to this, and also referred to some language he
identified only as "N**" (probably Novial) as "factory product" 
which, despite its alleged superiority, was less desirable (in his
opinion) than E-o.

Conscious trade-offs imply a kind of consistency to me,
so our disagreement is perhaps even less than first appears.
Perfection isn't possible or necessary. But here are a few
specific, curable Glosa inconsistencies that bother me:

The GE- past/passive participle ... Why not have an
active-present participle (AP)? (Actually some Glosa words
*do* have an AP embedded in the "root", which is to me
a sort of "inexcusable" "cheating".)

Why say "Glosa has no morphology" when it does have some?
It indicates foggy thought processes. (If any band of
guerrila language reformers wishes to purge *all*
morphology from Glosa, I might join.)

Similarly, the -BO set of unneeded affixes.

The genitives/possessives are sometimes treated like
descriptive adjectives, sometimes like determiners,
other times like prepositional phrases. Too fuzzy,
not "systematic" enough.

In the latest note from Wendy, it appears the awful
semicolon of Hogben has been dropped, hooray!
But it still looks like relexed Brit-English to me.
I guess that's a consistency, but the wrong type ...

The less grammar there is in the language, the more
important it is. Glosa might do well to clean it up a bit.
Alternatively, hope that users avoid mis-features and
converge, as if by the economist's "unseen hand". Or both.

Karo ami, 

(Well, yes, I know, it is silly, if I - with my low English skill - 
would work on an English dictionary.  But because I criticized 
around a few days ago, I should not only talk.  And so I start. 
...)

A new Glosa dictionary is available. Please visit: 

 - Glosa-English: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.htm 
               or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.txt.gz 
 - English-Glosa: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.htm 
               or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.txt.gz 

What is it? 

* Source was Bill Patterson's internet dictionary "Literary" (or 
    "Glosa All"). 
* Now it is formatted as an HTML-file with click-click-index 
    (gglen.htm and gengl.htm) and a plain ASCII-file (gglen.txt.gz 
    and gengl.txt.gz) for your personal formatting games.  Some 
    internet browsers decode the GNU-zip contraction automatically. 
* All three levels are in one file: 
    "Literary" is the source and it is completely contained. 
    Words from "Base"-dictionary (= all words without synonyms) are 
      marked with "+" (or "++"). 
    Words from "Core"-dictionary (= only most useful "Base"-words) are 
      marked with "++". 
  So a good overview of word preferences is given (although the 
  prefernces should change in advantage to Glosa 1000 in future). 
* New feature: 
    Glosa 1000 words are marked with "1". 
* To add the "1"-marks, I used the list "Glosa 1000 - English" from the 
    book "18 Steps to Fluency".  It has 1182 items.  (I know, there are 
    different lists of "Glosa 1000".  Even "English - Glosa 1000" in 
    the same book is not the same vocabulary.  I think, it does not 
    make much use to argue, wich list would be best for vocabulary 
    research.) 
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, 96 Glosa words have been found which 
    have not been in "Literary" before (mainly ending vowel 
    differences).  They are now added.  The words are listed in the 
    file www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggehist.txt.gz.  
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, about 170 English meanings to Glosa 
    words have been found which have not been in "Literary" before.  
    They are now added.  They are listed in .../ggehist.txt.gz, too. 
* As Wendy wanted, it is free available in WWW, but the source is 
    mentioned.  So, no password-locking is a hindrance to learn 
    Glosa. 
* Only the Glosa-English file is worked on.  The English-Glosa is a 
    simple computer reverse.  That could have caused errors. 
* Because I am stupid, new mistakes certainly were added.  Please find 
    them. 


What now? 

  The new file gives the possibility to access all Glosa words AND 
  to prefer Glosa 1000.  
  So, a text written with the internet dictionary can be understood by 
  a learner of printed vocabulary lists from Richmond.  Unfortunately 
  that was not so easy before. 
  
  Next step should be to supplement the list "English 5000 to 
  Glosa 1000" from the book "Central Glosa" to cover a bigger 
  meaning's field with the heart vocabulary. 

  Perhaps you have some suggestions how to do it.  As I wrote, my 
  scanning and OCR-text recognition failed (I tryed the program "Text 
  Bridge Pro 9.0").  Does anybody else want to have a try?  If it must 
  be typed in manually, does anybody want to help?  The "E5000G1000" 
  has 51 pages.  Thanks in advance. 

Saluta - Marcel <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>

I did not realize that she was releasing it; she said:
"Tu lice kopi ali-ra ex plu pre-PGN pro tu WWW.
Place dona fonta (state source)." If "pre-PGN"
includes Glosa-6000, that's really great!

Adding all the vocabs together, distinguishing the "basic"
from "extended", as you are doing, is the thing to do.

If the raw gif images were divided among several people,
typing or correcting the OCR output can be accomplished.
I would be willing to take a share of that.

Subject: [glosalist] vocabulary, word-building
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Mon, 07 Aug 2000 15:27:55 -0700


Glosa was designed as an analytic/isolating language.
Instead of the grammaticalized suffixes of Esperanto,
which are difficult or impossible for the average human
to master, plain word-compounding (hyphenation)
is sufficient to communicate any idea.

That intention was not always maintained in Glosa.
Many words carry frozen suffixes clumsily in the root:
FUNCTIO, FUSIO, GENERALI, GLOBULA, etc among the
"basic" vocabulary, and much worse in the 6000-set:
FUNE/FUNEBRI, GAMBA/GAMBADO, GELATO/GELATINO.
Much better are the words like GLUKO, GRAFI, GREGA.

As I understand it, compounding is the only valid
word-building mechanism in a pure analytic/isolating
typology; probably no natural language has ever been
100% A/I, but that's how I want Glosa to be, so one
could truthfully say that "Glosa has no affixes".
This makes it maximally easy for beginners, who will
constitute over 90% of the "Glosa-pe" for a long time.
(Of course, the syntax must be kept simple as well.)

To make spontaneous word-building possible for the
beginner (at least), there must be some system to it.
Certain kinds of compounds are so frequent ("productive")
that they can be listed, and mastered easily. Glosa's
so-called generics are a very poor set in my opinion,
both because they are too short (-BO -PE etc) and
there aren't nearly enough of them. Also, they're ugly!

http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/BaseTypes.htm

This would be a better bunch of generics, in "standard"
CVCV form, IMO. There is even a lot more material to be
mined there; the EuroWordNet project is now completed.
They have identified the top concepts across several
eurolangs (8) and it is modern scientific work, not
the sort that Dr. Gode faked in the 1940's at IALA.

To the extent that Glosa has suitable words for these
60 or so items, some of them coinciding with the generics,
there would be no change or additions needed, just a
presentation of them as useful compounding elements.

Then, a fuller examination of the 1000 or so "common
base concepts" would fill in the holes of Glosa's vocab.

    I myself am not so concerned about purity in conformity with an
ideal as with what works in practice.  Indeed, has that not been said
about Occidental?  As for whether an intention as an analytic/isolating
language has been maintained in Glosa, I think it it has approached
close enough as to be acceptable.  The prefixes and suffixes of which 
I take it that Charles disapproves are really, in my estimation, just
shortened forms of compounding elements.  Are the "-bo" series of
formants ugly?  Well, ugly is in the eyes of the beholder.  I don't
think they are ugly.

    One think we must beware of for constructed auxiliary languages 
is the quest for perfection.  It is a vain delusion and a snare.  One
person's necessary feature is another person's fatal flaw.  We will
never satisfy everybody.  Period.  If Esperanto were to become widely
used as an international auxiliary language, I would support it.  It 
is certainly a far sight easier than English, which is the most widely
used international lauxiliary language in history.  Of course, I think
we can do better than Esperanto, but in the end it comes down to
drawing lines, and people in the large will never draw them in the
same places.  I agree with Mario Pei that the quest for perfection can
actually be the enemy of the auxiliary language movement.  Good enough
is good enough, and except for vocabulary selection, I think Glosa is
good enough structurally as it stands.

    Learning vocabulary has always been my bugaboo.  I recently
finished a three-term course in Latin.  I had no difficulties with the
grammar (including, for the most part, the morphology).  Retaining
vocabulary was the hard part for me.  Indeed, if I did not have such 
a difficult time with vocabulary, and more leisure time to prepare
(something now in short supp;ly for me), I would try to write more in
Glosa.

In this case (Glosa) I think greater purity leads to greater ease
in practice. But in the case of Occidental, which seeks to leverage
the (European) learner's native language instincts, a quest for
purity is even sillier than usual when speaking of language.

I still want more truth-in-advertising: Glosa currently *does*
have a certain amount or morphology/inflection, but claims that
it doesn't. This, like the statement "Glosa has no grammar",
is at least a tactical error, reducing its credibility.

If it is possible to use Glosa-sin-morphology, I think it
works better ... and is more linguistically "interesting".
I accept the point about perfection being unattainable,
and even divisive in the unhappy history of auxlangs.

Thank you, you obviously read my mail of Friday.  I believe, Wendy is 
more friendly, generous and reasonable as we often think here in 
Glosalist.  Here I was talking about another letter from her.  But 
actually I cannot find it at the moment.  Hope that does not bring me 
into jail some day :(.  Let me say something to my defence:

- I really do not want to harm anybody.  I just want to help. 
- Remember, that internet is very young.  Maybe in the beginning Ron 
  and Wendy, as many other people in the world, could not see the 
  amazing possibilities in it.  And so the trouble with the 6000 on 
  the net came into existance.  Perhaps this is history, now. I, for 
  instance, would not know anything about Glosa without the internet. 
- When I started Glosa one year ago and I could not extract Bill's 
  dictionary files because I did not know the password, I was near 
  to quit with Glosa and wanted to take a language with better web 
  material and more generous promoters, already. 
- I do not earn money when I publish the dictionary.  If so, it would 
  be fair to participate the authors, of course. 
- There is a lot of advertisement for GEO on my website, although it 
  is forbidden (The server belongs to a University and is so somehow 
  governmental and must not be misused for profit by private 
  economy.).
- The difference between Bill's dictionary and 6000 is so big that I 
  would not say there could be protection claimed.  But I am not a 
  lawyer. 
- I bought books from GEO and paid money for it.  If the material 
  would be satisfying, I could concentrate on writing in Glosa and 
  communication and would not have to build up a vocabulary first.  
  So it is me who is damaged.  (And you, because you have to stand my 
  English mistakes, instead of reading me writing Glosa.) 
- Why not change all ending vowels into -e.  Then the copyright will 
  be goofed and we have one more problem solved ;).

Thank you very much for the offer.  I will send you three pages.  
Please tell me when you need another format (I personally think TIFF 
is better than GIF) or another resolution (I will send you 300 dpi 
because it is better for OCR.  For manual typing 200 dpi is enough.). 
Of course, Charles, this is really copyright violation, ...

It is only a friendly disagreement some of us have with
the authors, seeing them as insufficiently net-aware, etc.

It is an excellent site indeed. If necessary, we could move
it to another hosting site. Probably best would be to start
a "glosa.org" so all the various sites can be linked centrally
and search engines will find everything. Someday you will need
to move yours, I imagine. Fortunately ISPs are becoming more
generous in their disk quotas, and more people are hosting
on their own home machines (using cable or DSL connections).

You are obviously a dangerous radical subversive!
Tu es sura u risko rugo-rosa anti-crati-pe sed ko boni English!

(That's from Glosa-1600. I guess adverbs-modifying-verbs
should follow the verb?)

These pages are so small, manual typing is best, easy
to proof/correct; the pages you sent are fine for me.
You are correct, 300/400 DPI is best for OCR or small text
but 200 is good for manual input -- fits better on screen.
My browser does not handle TIFFs well, and I think
GIF/PNG has made TIFF obsolete (I used to work with
CCITT TIFFs, there are too many crazy sub-formats for
even software to tolerate; all those tilings ...)

One item, probably left over from a scanning error a long time ago...

   "adelo +   uncIear" in gglen.htm

   "uncIear   adelo +" in gengl.htm

Should be "unclear" {not evident; not obvious}.

(That's all you need to read of this post. The rest is just a whine.)

(Well, wait, read this bit too...)

Marcel, is the G1600 going to be posted separately, and/or merged into
your gglen and gengl? I'd like to see both, with G1600 folded into gglen
and gengl, thus continuing the evolution of the NetGlosa we've pondered
before on this list. But that's probably going to result in some more
irregularities. Glosalistas may want to take a look at my old criteria
page...

   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/criteria.htm

where I outlined some of my ideas in re Glosa word selection.

And watch out for those final vowels! (What *should* we do with those
things? As somebody once pointed out (Paul?), they're almost like a
gender because you have to learn what vowel terminates each word. Except
that its a useless bunch of genders because they have no effect on
anything else in the sentence. We can't just drop them because that
would be harder to pronounce *and* there are still some words that
differ only in the final vowel. Probably best not to worry about them
too much, but also to not take them too seriously!)

(Okay, now the whine begins...)

Which also brings to our attention another of those multilingual and
prefix-that-isn't-a-prefix problems of the Glosa vocabulary... "a(d)"
in the sense of "at, to, towards" (explicit) versus "a" in the sense
of "not" (implicit). Eek! In Glosa, "delo" is "clear" and "adelo" is
"unclear"... but "a-" is *not* "un-". Things like this make it *very*
difficult to grasp Glosa's vocabulary.

One could argue that even though the "a" in "adelo" *looks* like a
prefix to somebody with prefixes in mind, it isn't. Can't be. Glosa
doesn't prefix that way. If it were a prefix, the word would be
"a-delo", which is obviously something other than "adelo". Still...
what to make of these words?...

re[+]    again; return to beginning
pro[+]   forwards
recede   go back
procede  go forward
cede     cede; yield
ki       go; move
ex-ki    leave

The "ki"/"ex-ki" pair looks okay. But it seems that "recede" and
"procede" should be spelled with hyphens. Except that "cede" is not "go"
(though it does imply movement of some sort). Eek again! Maybe we should
discard "recede" and "procede" and add "re-ki" and "pro-ki". Or simply
discard "recede" and "procede". Or something.

Maybe we should discard "adelo". We should use "ne delo" or "ne-delo"
or "no-delo" instead. Ah! That would be one way of simplifying and
regularising the vocabulary: eliminate all unique opposite and negative
words. In the basic dictionary, anyway.

I still think the vocabulary would have been better if they had chosen
Latin *or* Greek rather than Latin *and* Greek. That duality is the
source of many problems.

Glosa's grammar is its strong point; its vocabulary needs some work.

What is English "pity" in Glosa? "miseri". What is English "pitiless"
in Glosa? "neleo"! For a literary dictionary I suppose that's okay, but
for basic use it's overly irregular. One might almost think of Glosa as
having five ineffective genders and thousands of inflections.

("miseri manko" would probably be my preference for "pitiless")

And what is Glosa "leo" in English? "lion"! I know, no hyphen in
"neleo", so I guess we're safe there. Inspiration for some wordplay!
>From "miseri" to "neleo" to "ne-leo" to "leo".

The beautiful *euphonic* vowels? Those are to optimize Glosa's
phonology for operatic shower singing. In my New Jersey dialect
they are all pronounced as schwa, and I have no intention of ever
memorizing them. That's a spell-checker's job. I could imagine
Glosa sounding like Valley-Girl Bantu; maybe they are tones?

I prefer CVCV Latinate words that lack any embedded prefixes.

It seems Ron Clark picked mostly Latin words, and the
Greek are mostly Hogben's.

Karo Bill, 

Thank you for your comments. 
I will be a few days off-line and answer then. 

The idea was only, to put the "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" list 
(from the book "Central Glosa") in your dictionary, and then 
change some preferences ("Core") in advantage to Glosa 1000 
(whatever Glosa 1000 is, we talked about it) with it.  

I did not want to start a new project, but to supplement yours.  
Later we can put the files together, again.  

Saluta - Marcel

but what I said about Ron Clark is true.  He may have started out with
Glosa unbiassed, but as time passed, he did favour Greek roots over Latin
ones, claiming that the Greek roots were muuch better for derivation of
terms and for the making of compounds, because of the superior
"agglutinative" qualities of the Greek roots.
eg  He favoured ~syn~ over ~ko~ = with
           and ~hidro~ over ~aqa~ = water.

*   The directions are from opposite ends: the majority of euro-auxlangs
start from an acceptance of the status quo in modern Euro-languages, and
selects vocabulary from this source; Ron sought the most common present-day
words, and then projected backwards from here to the roots of these common
words, and built the glosa lexicon from there.

Learner's Vocabulary, with only a word a concept; but, for satisfying

the presence of adequate synonyms.

*   Please, Alexander, avoid such negative mental conditioning; your mind
is not yet fluent in thinking in Glosa.
    As far as I am concerned, the real secret about Glosa is learning to
thinkin a fairly objective (non-idiomatic) way about what you intend to
say.  After this, run snippets of phrases through your mind to see how they
"feel".  The next bit is to form complete phrases, so that when you say
them to yourself they retain the original meaning you intended .. and your
mind gets the "sensation" of the original intention, without thinking of
the actual language you are using.  After being happy with the phrase
stage, ^clicking^ these together to make full sentences in faily easy.
    Using clauses takes a little more work, because you are asking the
brain to hold, at one time, a number of more complex ideas, plus their
inter-connections.  Doing this all in Glosa requires a reasonable memory of
the necessary Glosa words, plus a fair understanding of the syntax
structures, and a facility with the phrasal structures associated with the
different words.
  EG     a fe domi       ex plu boteka      merca u sito

Mali, kako! (I exaggerate for comic effect.)

A great advantage of analytic/isolating typology
is the ease of adding vocabulary from any source,
as long as the basic CVcv phonology (initial stress)
is not violated. I was just thinking of this:

SUtra ... a small strand/thread/line of thought

It doesn't matter whether such a term is pronounced
with a proper /a/ or not, unstressed vowels are
indistinct in speech and can't be heard amid noise.
However, Brits really must pronounce R somehow ...

To permit lexical differences marked only by one final
(unstressed) vowel is a flat-out loser of an idea.
English speakers cannot pronounce -e /e/ or -o /o/,
and will certainly (ab-)use schwa for -a /a/.
Lose the English speakers, and Glosa has no base.

The solution is to bow to linguistic reality and let
the finals "float", i.e. vary in spelling. They're
purely cosmetic, for ease and grace of pronunciation.
The few Glosa pairs like BALI/BALE should be fixed.

Occidental mainly abandoned use of final vowels for
syntactic use ala Esperanto/Ido. It was a good move;
De Wahl wrote about the phonological difficulties of
unstressed syllables such as -va/-ra/etc for tense,
which led him to use analytical auxiliaries ha/va
just as Glosa uses pa/fu. Convergent evolution ...

I went looking for Glosa words containing Y

The 33 words in J look like this:

JUVE youth; youthful

JUXTA next to

Um, now guess how J is supposed to be pronounced?

Not many X's or even Z's or Q's.

Is W now allowed or not?

In an auxlang designed for world use,
where rapid acquisition is the #1 priority,
why not simplify a little where possible?
Some light-hearted proposals:

J ... to be pronounced as /dZ/ (English "J")
      *or* as /Z/ (French "J")
      *or* as /j/ (English "Y"), as at present

Y ... to be eliminated from Glosa

Z ... to be merged with S, Z itself eliminated
      (as in the Costa-Gavras movie)

C ... to be eliminated, replaced by K or S

Q ... replaced by KW xor KV (either but not both)

W ... maybe better just use V instead

    I do not agree.  We English speakers -- Americans, at least; I will
not claim for others -- must realize that just because we have slovenly
speech habits, that is not an excuse for allowing or expecting
slovenliness in an auxiliary language.  Does all the rest of the world
have to conform to our sloppiness?  Might not others in the world
justifiably expect *us* to tighten up a little instead?  For that
matter, some languages speak syllables more or less with equal stress,
so there need not necessarily even *be* such a thing as an unstressed
syllable in an auxiliary language.  Let us not be seduced into taking
our native habits as always some sort of universals.

    English, despite its heavily latinate vocabulary, is structurally 
a germanic language in which, to some extent, consonants are more
important than vowels.  But in other languages, vowels have much more
importance than they do in English.  To speakers of such languages,
fine distinctions of vowels which to us are absurd are to them quite
normal.  Maybe everybody needs to be willing to give a little, and for
us that might mean more care with vowels than we are accustomed to.

    However, English speakers really must pronounce vowels better
somehow.

    Perhaps only to speakers of languages in which vowel distinctions
are less important than consonant distinctions.  See above.  I simply
do not agree.  All I want is consistency across wordlists.

> English speakers cannot pronounce -e /e/ or -o /o/,

    Then let's scrap Glosa (and every other constructed auxlang) 
and have everybody speak English.  After all, English is the most 
successful auxiliary language in history.  Why not stick with a 
winner?

I don't think that's relevant.  Dutch is a germanic language.  
Compare the English (language) and Dutch pronunciations of
"Haarlem".  In both cases the stress is on the first syllable.  
In English, the vowel pronounced between the L and the M is the
one that is pronounced between the B and the L of "able".  In
Dutch, what is heard between the L and the M is the vowel (short)  
E pronounced with absolute clarity.

The issue with an IAL is that it has to be defined, and then there
has to be conformity with the definition, because that's all there
is, that's what the language is, that is the whole universe.  The
pronunciations of the vowels are specified.  You pronounce them
according to specification.  No ifs or buts or sometimes.  You
have to assume that the definition of the IAL is complete.  You
don't swallow vowels because no method of doing that, no protocol
as to when to do it, and no corresponding pronunciation, has been
specified.

I wouldn't call it slovenly though; we simply stress our first
syllables strongly in good Germanic style. Glosa's phonology
depends upon it; so it is built-into both English and Glosa.
The particles seem to get a secondary stress. This is why
you *can* hear those hyphens in compounds. Without the strong
stress pattern, it would all just turn to mush.

> some languages speak syllables more or less with equal stress,

Yes, but Glosa has stress-timing rather than syllable-timing.

> important than vowels.

Same for Italic languages, because Indo-European was even more so.
In the latinate vocabulary, consonants carry roughly 16 bits
per word, vowels 4 bits. But by not populating all the possible
combinations, it becomes easier to distinguish speech (redundancy).
Having chosen 5 vowels and 15-20 consonants, inevitably the C's
are more important than V's ... and then etymology of the roots
just reinforces that tendency. No way we could change the
first vowel in most roots; and no way to remember the second.
I'm only arguing for ease of learning and use -- it matters!
(Actually, the most vocalic language I've heard was Tahitian,
and even there the consonants dominate.)

> Maybe everybody needs to be willing to give a little, and for
> us that might mean more care with vowels than we are accustomed to.

Yes, and even more so for consonants; L/R is difficult for many.
Given the latinate bias, we are stuck with both F/V.
But there is little need or use for the S/Z distinction.

> All I want is consistency across wordlists.

That is certainly achievable. But I'll never be able to
memorize etymologically wrong final vowels, and nobody
who knows "silvi" will fail to understand "silva".

One might want to co-opt the leader to win in the marketplace.
Nobody but a few Americans and British have heard of Glosa,
so they must be coddled a little. If it were difficult to do,
then it wouldn't be worth the effort, but this is so easy.

"In Glosa, final vowels don't matter, they just sound nice."

Yes, once Glosa becomes "frozen" in its design ...
but as it is, Glosa looks quite unfinished to me.
Are W and Y in the alphabet? Undefined.
Esperanto froze (in terror?) its inadequate design.
An IAL must evolve more quickly than that.

I have a proposal in my reply to Paul B.
It is only half in jest.

No, in order for it to have a design.  You are talking about
modifying the design.  That's fine, but off the point.  In fact
you are not (so far) even doing that, but merely subverting the
design.  Saying, ignore it, and pronounce as in English.

Fine.  All you have do to is write a pronunciation guide for Glosa
which places within the language the vowel pronunciations that you
think are needed at the places where you think they are needed.

Sorry, I'm a dummy.  You'd need to make it clearer for me.

Yes. And my biggest problem in Glosa is that I translate into glosa from
English, and not from Russian, many my mistakes is typically English, and If
i would translate from Russian, I would not made theese mistakes. (i hope

or any criteria to apply during the process?

However (sorry to butt in on this one) Sid sent a large graphics
file.  He sent it by mistake.  Many people could not read
it.  Some e-mail transport programs rejected it.  Alexander, this 
happened just before you reported your problem.  Is it the same
matter?

    There are several wordlists which could serve as at least
preliminary guides.  Rick Harrison, with assistance from others,
compiled what I think he may have called his Universal Language
Dictionary (ULD).  I don't have a current URL.  A couple of years ago,
I collated the wordlists of Basic English, Essential World English, and
the Longman Defining Vocabulary.  The collated list in ASCII text
format is at ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary .

    I do not suggest that somehow there be some sort of slavish one 
for one word substitution between a basic Glosa dictionary and such
wordlists (especially the one I collated, because E.W.E. may rely on
some of the principle of Basic English, which I consider basically
fraudulent).  However, if a Glosa dictionary has sufficient vocabulary
to express what these sorts of lists express, then I would think well
of it.

That's especially appropriate since Hogben did the ESE.

*    These are in my understanding transitional, residual forms:
The "Y" comes in a few words, mainly from Greek, and will ultimately be
replaced by an "I".
     "W" occurs in very few Classical roots, so will not be seen in most
Glosa texts.  I cannot see that there need be a special ruling on either of
these letters.
     Because the Glosa treatment of proper nouns has them rendered as they
are in the original language, then these 'strange' letters will still be
used for Place names and "foreign" personal names.  EG  William Healy pa
habe meso-vora ko an amika, Yonny Zerow, ex Woyabi intra Zambia.

     I think these letters can be 'tolerated.'

Saluta,
  Robin

 > selection.

The criteria are good.  Please one further criterium: 
Prefer "Glosa 1000"!  

I am afraid, we need a discussion protocol for every word.  A simple 
start is my collection of your Glosalist-mails in the file 
  www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggehist.txt.gz.  


 > Maybe we should discard "adelo". We should use "ne delo" or 
 > "ne-delo" or "no-delo" instead.  ... 

I agree with you: 

  adelo (unclear) ---> no-delo 

A similar example: 

  absenti (absent) --> ab-es 

(- Hyphen! 
 - Glosa-1000-elements! 
 - -nt- is Latin present participle marker.  Out of Glosa with such 
     things!)

Negatives and opposites are important, but generally bad style.  
Because it is not the way our brain works.  See "neurologic 
programming", "positive thinking", "auto-suggestion"... .  The 
American dream is "you can make it", never "you will not fail". 


 > What is English "pity" in Glosa? "miseri". What is English

I do not know, whether you read my comments to the Internet Dictionary 
(my Glosalist-mail of 00-07-28).  I send it to your personal 
email-address.  In paragraph 3 there is a list of similar problems.

Opposites maybe should be marked in the basic dictionary
if they are included.

I wonder if some people on the list could **HELP** typing
the English-Glosa 5000 ... it is easy work though tedious,
and you learn the Glosa vocabulary better. Not only that,
but for each page (100 items per page) you do, you earn
valuable grouser points redeemable as complaints against
finals or grammar or whatever ... a great bargain!

I took Paul's list of approx 2700 EWE-etc words,
mangled and merged it with Rick Harrisons VITAL list
of approx 2300, and made a single list of 3028
"vital and essential" English words and affixes.
A piece of it (pla- words) looks like this:

      3 place
      3 plain
      3 plan
      3 plane
      2 planet
      3 plant
      3 plastic
      3 plate
      1 platform
      3 play

1 = appears only in Paul's list (625 items)
2 = ditto Rick's (340 items)
3 = is in both (2113 items)

This was easy to do using standard Unix/Linux tools
"sort/uniq" etc. I did simplify complex entries a bit,
e.g. "a/an" was separated into "a" and "an". Only
individual words were kept, e.g. "in favour of" was
dropped, "favour" kept. Perfection is unattainable!
Are there too many? I don't think so, because many are
derivatives; I'm surprised the total is so low:

      3 indoor
      1 indoors

      1 industrial
      3 industry

      3 infect
      1 infection
      1 infectious

      1 infer
      1 inference

I think it's pretty good for its purpose.

Charles does really a good job.  When   Y O U   will join us, we have

Basic reference says:

        C always as CH in CHurCH;
        G always hard as in Go;
        J as the Y in Yes;
        Q as QU in QUick;
        R always sounded, trilled if possible;
        SC as the "sh" sound in neSCience.

There are few languages that distinguish CH SH K S and Z.
This is a needless difficulty in Glosa, which is otherwise
very easy to pronounce, more so than the other IALs.
There are not too many words using Z or SC that they
must be retained -- they even look archaic.

Subject: [glosalist] thoughts about dictionaries
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2000 10:19:28 -0700


I have collected several English word lists such as
Paul's and Rick Harrison's metalists, and several
well-known individual lists such as West's, Kilgariff's,
WordNet, etc. I sort and merge and edit them in various
ways to explore what use they might be in defining a core,
base, general, or full list of concepts needed for an IAL.
I've also tried this with collections of other IAL word
lists such as Eurolang, Ido, Lingua Franca, etc. What
it all amounts to is a huge table sort of like this:

LANG1    SOURCE1  WORD1      LANG2     SOURCE2  WORD2
English  WEST     talk       Vul.Lat.  Xxx      parle

This is symmetrical so it represents a pair of entries,
bidirectionally "parla <--> talk". The whole mess can then
be sorted in various ways, so for instance all the words
equivalent to "talk" appear together. Then if there is no
entry for Glosa it can be considered "missing"; or if only
Glosa has a word for it, then it might be considered
superfluous for the purpose of a core dictionary. (There
are some exceptions possible but I ignore them for now.)

Occidental is also in a state of not having a good online
dictionary. I strongly believe that there can and should be
some cooperation and cross-fertilization between IALs,
especially those derived from european languages. So this
may be pointing to a combined database of IAL word lists.
It would be too big for convenient online access, assuming
52k modems and ISP limits on space and CGI, but not for
a home PC with DSL, which is probably becoming the norm.

Further ideas related to Glosa? I don't intend to talk
without doing, or do without planning, so I'm asking ...

Sounds like a useful way to see if all the semantic field is properly
covered. If you do this you need to allow for the fact that there is not a
one to one correspondence between any two language (as you know), in fact
there is a many to many mapping involved here.

In particular, when looking at Glosa, by design, a Glosa word should map to
a number of English synonyms and near synonyms. (The Glosa authors claim up
to 100 English words might be covered by one Glosa word). And also that many
"concepts" represented in English by a single word are represented in Glosa
by a short "phrase" of two or more words.

This is very true, and unavoidable between any pair of languages.
One way to solve it is to use "synsets" to differentiate:

ENGLISH             GLOSA
spring, fountain    fonta
spring, elastic     elasti

> by design, a Glosa word should map to

That's the "word-building" or "derivational" facility.
I have many complaints about Glosa in this area, where
it is not faithful enough to its own principles:

ENGLISH         GLOSA
submarine       submarina
submerge        subomerge <--- subO
subscribe       subskribe <--- sub

Now, the "subo=under" and "merge/skribe" are nice,
so why not SUBOMERGE and SUBOSCRIBE? With disyllabic
roots, it is extremely easy to make such compounds,
and they are easy to recognize in actual speech,
whether or not hyphenated because of the stress.
I suppose SUBO (= INFRA) was just an error in the
materials, but it avoids consonant clusters.
Otherwise, ambiguously parsable words act like
frozen non-compoundable roots:

ENGLISH         GLOSA
sudden          subito
sublime         sublime
subject         subjekti

Glosa has quite a few roots suitable for compounding,
and of course those should go into basic vocab;
Greek used root+o+root extensively and productively,
and Greek is the basis of Glosa (for better and worse).

No Catty. This is just not adding to Glosa's
use of internationally recognized words. To
Use something like SUBOSCRIBE is just plain
silly. Who in their right mind would come
up with such a term when the languages that
are at the base of glosa vocabulary omit the
O... why insist on putting things in to make
the language more artificial. Glosa is simple
and beautiful enough without all the faky made
up stuff. No I don't agree that there is any
need for a sounding vowel between the root.

Take the roots from Latin and Greek. Fonetize
them and make them work. It is simple and in
my eyes it is beautiful.

Since,
Jay B.

I took several (5) of the word lists, combined and sorted etc.
It looks like this (all the "cit-, civ-" items):

2       cita        quote, urge
1       citate      city
1       citi        swift
2       citri       lemon
1       citro       citrus, lemon
1       citronada   lemonade
1       citru       citrus
4       civi        citizen
4       civili      civil, courteous, courtesy, meek, mercy, polite
1       civili-an   gentleman
1       civili-fe   lady
3       civiliza    civilization, civilize
1       civismo     good citizenship
4       civita      city

The first column is the number of citations,
which helps point out typographical errors, and
which are the "core" words too, to some extent.
There are 8567 items in total, 5638 appear only once,
1401 appear twice, 1528 more than twice.

I am putting the file temporarily on my web area:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/glosatest.dat

Columns are tab-separated, parenthetical info deleted.

> Next task should be the change of word preferences

I wonder how we should proceed, after getting familiar
with the material? For example, the FAV- words need
to be cleaned up ...

1       favi      honeycomb
2       favo      favor, favour, partial, privilege
2       favori    favorable, favour
2       favorita  favorite
1       favu      honey comb

... by selecting just 2 di-syllabic roots from proper Latin,
preferring the infinitive verb form wherever possible,
and converting -US/-UM to -O (and -IS to -I):

2  favus   FAVO   honeycomb
6  favere  FAVE   favor, favour

An alternative strategy might be to examine several modern
euro-languages instead of Latin. Then it would be "favo"
for both of the above, which is awkward, or just pick
FAVO/FAVI arbitrarily.

Then derivatives can be formed in straightforward manner.
I don't dislike final vowels when they are etymologically
sensible and phonologically easy to distinguish.

Of the 2 roots, only one is likely to be useful in
forming compounds, the other is a low-frequency item.
This could be indicated by bold-type or stars or something.
It would be nice to list the source word too.

This mail tells you A) how the Glosa words are built and B) how to 
learn them easily. 


A) Glosa words are built from (scientific) English. 
   e.g.: 
    English "graph-I-cs" = drawing  
    --->  Glosa word for "to draw" = "grafi".
    English "graph-O-logy" = science of psychological analysis of 
                               hand-WRITing 
    --->  Glosa word for "to write" = "grafo". 

B) And now how to learn Glosa words: 
   - Learn Latin                     !! 
       It is the source language. 
   - Learn ancient Greek             !! !! 
       It is a source language, too. 
   - Learn English                   !! !! !! 
       Necessary for the ending vowels. 
   - Hope                            !! !! !! !! 
       Hope, you find the mnemotechnic trick!


Please let us   S T O (P)   this situation!

This mail tries to tell A) how the Glosa words are built [this time 
less cynical and I really do not know B) how to learn them easily]. 


- Some words are derived regularly from the classical words, like 
  Peano suggested. 
  Indefinite words remain as they are (ad, de, si, Greek: kata). 
  -a, -ae get (from ablativus) -a (silva), 
  -us, -us get -u (manu), 
  -is, -is get -i (turi), 
  adjectives -us/-a/-um get -o (karo), 
  verbs with -ere get -e (face), with -are: -a (lauda), -ire: -i 
  (veni). 

- Same with greek.  Greek has no ablativus, so take dativus: 
  -os, -u gets -o (fobo, orto). 

- Greek verbs get -o (1st person singular) (skizo) 

- (I suppose: A regular system will cause too many -o-endings? 
  Perhaps the language would sound too masculine?  From Ninja-films 
  I know, Japanese has it the other way round: -a masculine and -o 
  feminine.  However:) 
  Latin words with -us, -i or -um, -i do NOT get -o, but ???. 

- Latin -io, -ionis do not get ablativus-ending -ione but keep the 
  nominativs -io (natio, okasio, petitio, religio, tensio). 
  [My personal opinion: -ione is too long, okay, but even -io is a 
  part-of-speech-marker.  Is it one syllable (-yo) or two (-ee-ow)? 
  No, there are two.  But then it is too long, I think.  A lot of 
  these words are derived from verbs.  "pete" and "tende"?] 

- (I suppose: Some Latin words are in international use mainly with 
  their perfect-tense-root.  So they took this root.  That could be
  reasonable.) 
  Words built from the perfect-tense-root get -i 
  (I suppose because of 1st person singular ending.) 
  (cepti, fluxi, komposi) 

- (I suppose for the same reason, international use:) Sometimes the 
  Greek aorist-root is taken instead of present-tense-root (gene). 

- Species names keep nominativus (equs, ursus). 

- See last mail: grafi from graphics and grafo from graphology.  This 
  was certainly a way to build some words.   Very interesting for this 
  is the book "Central Glosa".  E.g. (citation page 25) 
   "ami-able    ami    friend, -ly, kind 
    amo-ur      amo    love, like"
  (That is why the book is named "Central Glosa", because Glosa words 
  are in the centre.) 

- There is an article in "Plu Glosa Nota", no. 81 about deriving 
  Glosa words from Italian.  Unfortunately I have not got it.  Perhaps 
  it is interesting here.  Does anybody have it? 
  On page 2 of PGN 82 (this issue I have) there is written: 

    " Glosa E Italiano

      In PGN 81 na pa dice komo Glosa pote uti moderno Italiano de 
      gene id Mega lexiko. ...
      Posi Glosa pote prende plu participi pasato, - ..ATO, -ITO, -ETO 
      e -ABILI; kausa plu-ci parola-fini es proxi universali in plu 
      Euro-lingua.  ...
      Holo infinito ko -ARE, ERE, IRE diveni -A, -E, -I." 

- Perhaps you have more ideas about the secrets of Glosa words.  
  Please write. 
  (I suppose/fear, there is a secret about EVERY Glosa word, and no 
  real system for all.)

  I asked Wendy about ending vowels, their system and perhaps notices 
of some of their consideration work.  I will report, when she will 
answer.  I hope, she is not angry now after reading my letter.

  ... is good, too.  Let us go both ways simultanously.  
Latin is good for systematicality, but without an eye on modern 
languages Glosa would be a step back in language history. 
Is not there a revival of Occidental (modern Romanic words) for the 
same reason, after some years the scientificality of Interlingua 
(systematical derived vocabulary from Latin) was said to be perfect.

Ending vowels, word problems,- what to do? 

Perhaps we can start a new internet project "vocabulary research": 

  - We try to find a system for word building (like the list in one of 
    my previous mails, but better.) 
  - A maintainer puts a list of words to examine on a website. 
    This list could be "Glosa 1000", a new "Core"-dictionary or a 
    list of the ending-vowel-synonyms (silva/silvi, kara/karo ...) 
    or whatever anybody suggests. 
  - Everybody can help then.  Picking some words from the website, 
    looking up the Latin or Greek origin, looking up related words in 
    French, Spanish, Italian, ..., English, ..., Interlingua 
    dictionarys and collect them, making a suggestion of a better 
    Glosa word.  Then mailing it to the maintainer who collects all 
    entrys. 
  - Everybody can do as much as he wants.  If he has no Latin 
    dictionary, he may have an Italian.  Another has no Italian, but 
    a Greek.  Some wants to deal with old languages, some with 
    auxiliary languages and another wants only to make suggestions for 
    words.  The maintainer collects all and appends one comment to 
    a word to the previous comments to the same word and puts all 
    on the net. 
  - After a while we write all together and send it with a nice 
    letter to Wendy and hope she agrees or she writes other ideas. 
  - We put the new words into the Internet Dictionary, perhaps mark 
    them with asterisks as not original but to prefer. 

(Sorry, I cannot maintain such a list, because I have no direct access 
to my homepage.)

(Perhaps it is best to start with the ending-vowel-synonyms, because 
there Wendy can easily see that there must be changed something. )

  I would like to put the "+"s and "++"s to the "1"s 
(That means: prefer Glosa 1000 for the smaller dictionarys 
"Core"=++ and "Base"=+/++.).  

  This sounds simple, but it is not: e.g. 
 - After changing a "+" to an "1"-word in the English-Glosa-list, you 
     have to look up the Glosa-English-list for other related English 
     words.  There you will get other Glosa words, and so on. 
 - English homonyms (ring {bell}, ring {finger, ear})! 
 - Does the Glosa word really work like the English meaning? 
     E.g. "ab" is normally a preposition.  Or an adverb: "ki ab".  
     Does it really work to take it as an adjective "absent" or only 
     in a definite context?  Sometimes there is for one English word 
     no Glosa WORD but a Glosa DESCRIPTION given.  Can such a phrase 
     be equivalent to a word?  How do they behave in a word 
     compounding? 

  Does anybody see other traps?  And how to avoid or handle them?  
Please take the lists (../gengl.txt.gz and ../gglen.txt.gz) and have a 
try on your own! 

  For this work we need a new list of prefered English words.  
Because the current "Core" has now, after supplement of the 
"English 5000 to Glosa 1000", 3491 lines.  O.K, there are 
"honey comb" and "honeycomb", but they are too many. 

  I think about a list with about 2000 English words for "Core".  
Cleverly chosen, 2000 words are enough for standard situations and 
cover 85 % of English texts.  They will have less Glosa meanings, 
maybe 1600.  This vocabulary could be quite similar to "Glosa 1000" 
then.  

  We also need a new definition for "Base".  Former was: all words 
without synonyms (criterium English meanings, problem: English 
synonyms!).  Now, after supplement of E5kG1k, the list has 6884 lines. 
That is too much.  It should be 4000, or what do you suggest?

So, you think the 1401 should be the new "Core" and the 
1401+1528 the new "Base"?

Well, I added at least 2 of the "basic" dictionaries,
so all the basic words should be 2 or greater, and it seems
in all cases this does happen. Most of the 1 entries are
either Glosa-6000 or errors. So the simple count is a very
good heuristic trick.

>  - English homonyms (ring {bell}, ring {finger, ear})!

That is why the best way to sort Glosa words is *not* by
their English equivalents; and just 1000 G's become 5000 E's.
Then you get a lot of entries like this:

5       acide   event, happen, incident, occur

These (ACIDE etc) are the best and most important Glosa words.
It is clear from the multiple English equivalents what the intended
meaning of the G root is. Then we don't worry about E homonyms
or vague meanings like this:

1       adveni  happen

>  - Does the Glosa word really work like the English meaning?

I hope not. Natural languages are too messy and complex
for the IAL purpose: a second language for all adults.

>   For this work we need a new list of prefered English words.

I don't know if this is true ... I found and combined some good
English learner lists, but if Glosa is truly systematic then
we should focus on Glosa. Comparisons with the Interlingua IED,
Occidental Radicarium, any Romance language dictionary, etc,
are very useful too.

But I think we now have the 1500-3000 words we need for
the New Revised Glosa Internet Dictionary!! Actually I would
prefer to keep all the entries (approx 8567) minus errors.
We just BOLD TYPE the basic 2000 or so.

>   We also need a new definition for "Base".

The top 1500-3000. Maybe we need 3 levels:
essential 1500, basic 3000, full 8000.

Glosa Classified from Robin, approx 1050 words.
Glossref from Paul, approx 1600 words.
Glosa 6000, from Bill.
gec.dat core words, from Marcel.
g1e5 words, from Marcel et al.

We can do that as a Re-Neo-Glosa experimental project.
All living languages evolve, and we can help that process.
Lojban implemented a plan for future growth and reform.
Occidental is inherently mutable to adjust to user needs.
To freeze any language is either impossible or detrimental.

>   - Everybody can help then.

Radicals and reactionaries and moderates can all help.
We should make one restriction though, once we get organized:
all discussion about change must be in standard Glosa.
The first step is to clean-up the standard dictionary,
without any reforms, just collection and corrections.
Then we can try using the language, with translation
in English or some other. That's my suggestion.

We can alternate the identity of the maintainer.
You organized the G1E5 project and it was successful.
I think my collected list is good, and if people here
accept it, then that task is finished. Somebody else
may lead the next step, whatever it may be.

Yes, an important step.

About adding new vocab ... I think we should explore the system
of derivation, so that users can make all the terms they need.
The G1E5 list shows the methods preferred by the authors.
Essentially it is phrasal-compounding in the pidgin style;
the arbitrary words like these are not good:

Good idea. Do the safe and easy things first.

Easy to fix, though. After thinking more, it seems (to me) best
to do the least: keep just FAVO and FAVI, and change nothing.
We can do this for all 8500+ Glosa words and get a good baseline.

Both Occidental/Interlingue (IE) and Gode's Interlingua (IA)
combined and regularized vocabulary from several European languages.
IE focused on vocab and never had time or money for a completely
finished grammar, OCC focused on grammar and never finished vocab.

Perhaps the ideal is to combine OCC/IA in the obvious way.
Then users could evolve the "new" language by simplification --
there are too many grammatical features and words for world use.

Glosa can, instead, begin with simple grammar and vocab,
learning from OCC, IA, Esperanto, Ido, and other IALs
Mainly what needs improvement is the derivational system.

> - (I suppose: A regular system will cause too many -o-endings?

Too many collisions between common Latin words, e.g.:

mano/manare  ... flow, drip (eMANate)
maneo/manere ... remain, stay
mane (mana)  ... morning
manus        ... hand

No good way to resolve this traffic jam systematically.
There are more besides ... Glosa has lots of MAN- words:

4       mana      morning
1       manea     handle, manage
2       mania     frenzy, madness
1       manika    sleeve
1       manipula  manipulate
1       mano      rarefied
1       manovra   manoeuvre
5       manu      hand, hand over, pass {hand over}, smack
2       manubri   handle

Occidental has these MAN- roots:
maner = to remain, mani = many, manie = mania,
manier = manner, mann = man, manu = hand;
also: manna, manifest, manipular, manivelle, manovre.

>   Perhaps the language would sound too masculine?

No ... final vowels are always unstressed,
and rounded lips look cute on chicks. But Euros
don't like -u much, except maybe in Rumania.

> - Species names keep nominativus (equs, ursus).

Those -s words ... they bother me! Scientific words
(nomenclature) should be capitalized to show "foreignness".
Science is irrelevant to IAL use among common people,
and the scientists always make their own jargon.
Merely for propaganda, IALs invoke the word "science".
The correct terms are binomial, not just "Ursa".

> This was certainly a way to build some words.

>    "ami-able    ami    friend, -ly, kind

The method is good, but the components must be good too.
This is dangerously close to affixation, but it works ...
But tri-syllabic roots are not such good compounders.

ami-abili ... ability or worthiness to be loved
ami-agenti ... obvious, no?

All languages are unsystematic compromises, even Lojban, even
predicate calculus, even Java. But some are simpler and better
than others. I hear the linguistic police now at my door ...

However, languages really change through real use.  Artificial
languages seem to be somehow a prey to tinkerers (funny word) with
bright ideas not forged in real use, and not contributed by means
of a demonstration in real writing.  At the same time they (I mean
IALs) do not have the centre of gravity and the total weight of
usage which would allow them to shrug off attack, as it were.

Thus I suggest you need to be careful not to slip into the notion
of a freely reformable IAL.  It exists as defined, or it doesn't
exist.

Another comment, if this is about fundamental reform.  A Tetum
grammar by Geoffrey Hull will shortly be published, or so I have
read.  Not being a real student of these matters (I'm just
interested in a language for e-mail) I don't know how common
published grammars of anciently creolized languages are.  Nor how
useful the contemplation of one would be for Glosa developers.

But in case you are interested, here is a quote from the
Introduction to Hull's Tetum - English dictionary.

"... Tetum (like the other eight Austronesian languages of the
island, except Lovaia) descends from a language introduced from
the Buton region of south-eastern Celebes about a thousand years
ago.  Invasive Austronesian speech displaced the older Papuan
vernaculars of Timor ... and subsequently underwent the processes
of drastic structural simplification and restructuration which
linguists call pidginization and creolization...  Today Eastern
Tetum is a hybrid ... heavy Portugese superstratum.  The impact of
Portugese ... may be aptly compared to the massive influence of
French on English after the Norman Conquest."

    However, Hogben's original Interglossa was mostly Greek-based, and
a lot of the Glosa lexicon is also.  Thai's Frater leaned a little more
toward Latin than Glosa does, but Glosa has more Greek leanings.  I
know that some are in favor of Latinising WENSA-based* IALs in general,
but I am not convinced that a conIAL targeted at non-WENSAns also need
be entirely Latinate.  Now some might argue that without the WENSAns a
conIAL cannot take off, and that therefore they must be accomodated
first and foremost, but I am not convinced.  (However, I admit to some
slight personal bias toward Greek.)

    Perhaps this is a bias of native anglophones?  After all, I very
much doubt that an IAL intended for worldwide use can be everything to
everybody.  Why should structure always be biased in favor of
anglophone sloppiness?  Esperanto and Ido seem to get along well using
unstressed (by definition) final syllables as part-of-speech markers.

    See above.  I am not convinced that Euro habits must be the sole
determinant.

    What, then, would be a generic term for "bear," to include black
bears, sun bears, grizzly bears, and polar bears?

    Indeed.  I am wary of purism in IAL design.  There are always
trade-offs.  That is why, for example, 'ge-' does not offend me.

Nay, it is *already* officially part of the basic phonology
of Glosa to stress penultimately, not bias. I think Glosa
di-syllabic words sound very cool, like Bantu languages,
but many tri-syls are iffy, and there are too many mono-syls.

I shoulda used a better example: "Felis"; "feli" is a good
common word. All words in Glosa *should* end in vowels
(just my opinion, not a fact). The authors capitalize
species names because they are not part of normal vocab.
My point was that Glosa is no-way scientific, and those
ugly species names break from the predominant sound-pattern.
How about "Albertosaurus"?? "Buckminsterfullerene"????

How about a present/active participle to go with that?
The "ge" has proven itself useful and somewhat popular.

The present/active participle is just the unmodified word itself. There's no
need to complicate matters here by adding a redundant feature.

[About Charles's http://catty.com/~catty/lang/glosatest.dat ,
to the dictionarys on my site www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406 ]

Good: 
  Your glosatest.dat is a useful help for pointing out typographical 
  errors and for choosing Glosa synonyms. 

Not so good: 

 > >  > There are 8567 items in total, 5638 appear only once,

 > 
 > Yup!

  When you compare 5 different "Glosa 1000"s, you may get a 
Super-1000, but no real advance.  We cannot take glosatest.dat for 
making new "Basic" and "Core".  We would 

- destroy Bill's work!
    (That would be sad.  Bill did a good job.  It is only that we have 
    now a better data set.)
- get a lot of (bad and useless) synonyms! 
    (That was what Bill, Paul and Robin wanted to avoid.)
- and get other useless and unimportant words!


Examples: 

  We will have "aerodroma" (you marked with "3") in "Core" and "Basic" 
and "aeroporto" (2) in "Basic".  Or "aeroplana" (3) and 
"aeroplano" (2). Totally useless and bad synonyms.  But see Bill's 
word list.  He eliminated these synonyms already.  Let us not go back. 

  Glosa "adeno" is English "gland".  "gland" is not in your 
vitaless-list nor in Kilgariff-3000.  So "adeno" is not very necessary, 
but you marked it with "3" and it would come into the new "Core". 



  I think, the task remains (although I hope for other suggestions): 

- Put the "+"s and "++"s to the "1"s - manually!  And then, perhaps 
  after that, perhaps simultanously 
- Reduce amount of words in "Core" and "Basic"!  It is no perfect way 
  to take an English list for it, but your 
  http://catty.com/~catty/lang/vitaless.txt and Kilgariff-3000 would 
  be acceptable.

Good points. Mere counts are not sufficient.

I could add the source-list for each word automatically,
e.g. if Bill's list was A, G1E5 was B, etc:

ABCDE   5    razo    graze, scrape, shave
^^^^^

Manual editing is error-prone and not fun! I looked at
the GRA- words last night and started categorizing:

2       grata   scrape, scratch
1       psesto  scraped
1       radula  scraper
1       raspa   scrape
5       razo    graze, scrape, shave
1       razo-me razor
1       exkoria scrape skin off
1       abrazi  scrape

That's a lot of synonyms.

1       grati           grateful
5       gratia          grace, thank, thanks
2       gratioso        graceful
1       gratia de       thank you for
1       gratia-ple      grateful, thankful
1       gratia-ra       reward
3       gratula         congratulate
3       gratis          free, free of charge, without paying
1       kongratula      congratulate
1       ingratia-se     ingratiate oneself
1       disgratia       disgrace

This shows some of the "crypto-fixes".

3       seba        grease, suet, wax
4       lipo        fat, fry, grease, lipid
2       grasi       fat, grease
1       pingui      fat
5       paki        coarse, fat, stout, thick
3       obesi       fat, obese

1       adipo       animal fat
1       paki-fi     cable, cord
1       paki-karni  steak

The authors were obsessed with dieting?

1       topografi       topography
1       takografo       shorthand, stenography
1       tako grafi      sketch

There's a model word-family.

1       grana           grain
1       granari         granary
1       granata         pomegranate
1       pomegranata     pomegranate
2       granita         granite
1       granula         granule
1       holo grana      wholemeal

All of these share the same basic root, "grain".

I think Glosa needs a consistent derivational paradigm,
and some clear strategy for final vowels. Natural langs
are chaotic, but a designed IAL should not be so.

What's redundant? If I write "edi kani" or "kani edi"
it is very unclear what it means. Any verb used as
an adjective will benefit from "ge-" and a proper
active participle. In the official materials, "nu-"
is sometimes used as such, but this overloads the more
usual meaning. If "pa-" is different from "ge-", then
we need something different from "nu-" for the other.
Alternatively, perhaps someone can cite *any* language
with one participle and not the other?

  Good news from you, Nick.  Only 19 items for "A".  E5kG1k seems to 
be one of the best GEO lists. 


 > ante meso-di  a.m.  [should be ~pre meso-di~] 

  I recognized it already, too.  The idea was certainly to keep the 
English abbreviation "am". 

  What to do with such words?  Should we simply write 
"pre meso-di   a.m." and put "ante meso-di" into the "Literary" 
dictionary?  Or is it better to mark them (e.g. 
"pre meso-di *    a.m.") as not original GEO?  This is certainly a 
borderline case, because the elements "pre", "meso" and "di" are 
original.  But how to decide it by a computer program?  Is it better 
to correct the list before or to make first a new "Core"-dictionary 
and have then the advantage to work on a limited amount of words? 


  I have the feeling that you (Nick) are quite near to the spirit of 
Glosa (perhaps because you read "Plu Glosa Nota").  If criticism gives 
that feeling, it could be easily accepted by Wendy, I think.

   He told, that Wendy is very sad about the death of her life mate,

 her.  She is still working (in a print shop) and has stress there at 
 the moment, because her chief is absent and she has to run the show 
 alone now.  And she helps her mother, who cannot walk well. ]

Charles grafo: 
 > Manual editing is error-prone and not fun! 

  I think a human can better handle the language problems
(e.g. scrape, scratch, graze, shave or "a kron" and "a-kron"). 

  Your list (http://catty.com/~catty/lang/glosatest.dat ) is a 
supplement to human manual work, but (I think) it should be only HELP, 
not the work itself. 

  But maybe I am wrong.  Someone can write a program and see what it 
results.  Correcting the program's errors can be less work than doing 
all "manually".  Three possibilitys (all manually/ manually with help 
of computerized lists/ all computerized, then corrected), - I do not 
know.  Belongs also a bit to the programmer's ability (and to the 
English knowledge and motivation of the human). 


 > Sources:
 > 1 gec.dat
 > 2 glosaref.dat
 > 3 g1e5.dat
 > 4 ge.dat
 > 5 classif.dat 

So, Bill's "Core" is "1"?  Then I should send "Basic" to you, too.

Exactly! But after collecting terms manually for a hour,
covering only 1% of the list, I was able to do the whole thing
in .00001 seconds by algorithm. Anything requiring judgement
needs to be done manually, the rest automatically.

The real work at this moment is to discover
what to do about the inconsistent final vowels,
because that confuses the sort/merge function.
Perhaps only Wendy can give judgement on that;
I hope she says "Just make Marcel do it!"

Saluta, karo plu Glosa-pe!
Why current dictionary of Glosa has many words which don't necessary?
For example, GENE SKO - learn, APRENDE - learn, MATi -learn.
Maybe necessary to use words, teatra, artisti etc. which are International.
But some words are excrescent!
We don't need in adaptatio and in ADAPTA both, we must select.
(My choose is adaptatio - adaptation, to adapt, etc. And what is your
choose?)
Alexander.
P.S.
Now I am translating Glosa -all, and when I cannot understand meaning
of English word,
I search Glosa word in Russian, English, and Esperanto dics, and I can find
any Glosa word!
So vocabulary of Glosa is really International, It's grammar is easy, and I
think that Glosa need only in to things, which are: promotion and
minimization.

Subject: [glosalist] repair crypto-prefixes?
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Mon, 28 Aug 2000 11:31:59 -0700

I preformed the following easy experiments,
showing how both Glosa and English unsurprisingly
incorporate a huge number of prefixed words
following the Latin pattern of preposition+root,
e.g. "rebel = re + bell". The most common ones
seem to be "con- re- in- de- pre-".

Taking the first 2 letters of all common English words ...
cat /usr/dict/words | grep '^[a-z]' | cut -b -2 | sort | uniq -c  | sort -n | tail

    582 ca
    618 un
    625 su
    755 st
    866 di
    923 pr
    952 de
   1307 in
   1718 re
   1793 co

Now for Glosa. Only keeping the 10 most popular combinations ...
cut -f 3 glosatest* | cut -b -2 | sort | uniq -c  | sort -n | tail

    136 te
    142 pe
    165 re
    167 me
    170 pa
    173 ma
    180 st
    195 pr
    265 ka
    339 ko

Glosa vocab as listed in existing glossaries (Glosaries?)
is not as systematic as in Latin or English, but *is*
somewhat easily fixable. The result could be a much smaller
and more coherent/powerful and mnemonic vocab. For example,
consider all the Glosa "KO" words:

Some of them are already of the form "KO-etc":
ko-co ko-existe ko-habita ko-hesio ko-labora ko-lekti ko-opera ko-ordina ko-proletari

Some are "KONTRA-etc":
kontra kontra-akti kontra-co kontra-dice kontrabanda kontradice kontraface kontrakti kontramanda kontrapunkti kontrari kontrari-pe kontrasigna kontrasti kontraveni

Anyway, I propose that we identify all KO- words better written
as "KO-etc" or "KONTRA-etc" then list them that way. Correct
pronunciation would stress both KO and first syllable of root.
This makes derivation both transparent and *productive*,
for free generation of natural understandable compounds.

This would clean up the new Glosa dictionary and break no rules.
One problem: some of the separate roots are not defined, though
obvious enough and easy to add. For reference, here are all 339
official KO- words:

echo `cut -f 3 glosatest.dat | grep '^ko'`

kon-akti kon alelo ko-co korta-decide ko-existe ko-habita ko-hesio ko

  Thank you, Charles, for writing your UNIX-inputs.  I always admire 
UNIX-jugglers (and GNUplotters, too).  I have not so much practice 
with "uniq" etc and pipes.  Then it is good to have some examples. 


  I wrote a little program.  It brings out a lot of nonsense and has 
errors, yet.  But perhaps it could help for my/our problem 
(change +/++ to 1s in www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.htm ). 
Its output looks like this: 

...
---------------
  19 abjekti          mean 

4548 meandro          wind along 
4684 meskino +        mean; paltry 
5159 non-amo 1        disgust; mean {not nice} 
5649 per 1++          by means of; per 
6826 semani 1++       mean {to mean}; meaning 
6920 signifi 1++      mean; signify 
7682 tem-co +         meanwhile; time {at that} 
8441 volu akti 1      mean {v} 
8442 volu dice 1      mean {v} 
mean            : Paul; Rick; Adam 301 
---------------
  20 abjura +         abjure 

abjure          : 
---------------
  21 ablati           remove 

 498 apo 1++G         apart; away; remove; skim; subtract; whisk 
1381 depila +         remove hair 
6519 remove ++        remove 
remove          : Paul; Rick; Adam 2926 
---------------
...

  (Explanation: Numbers are line numbers in gglen.txt file.  So they 
could be found easily with a text editor. 
The program takes one line, e.g. line 19 with "abjekti".  It takes the 
English meanings, here only one, "mean".  Then it searches through the 
whole rest of the file for all English meanings of abjekti and prints 
out the lines (with line numbers), where it founds them. 
After that it gives to every English word the information, whether it 
is in Paul Bartlett's list, in Rick Harrison's list and on which 
position it is in the BNC of Adam Kilgariff. 
Then the program takes the next line (here line 20 with abjura).) 

  How to work with the list:  e.g. "ablati" remains only in the 
"Literary"-dictionary, because there is a synonym ("apo") in the 
"Core" already.  The Glosa word "remove" will be removed from "Core", 
because in "Core" there is already "apo", and "apo" has a "1", so it 
is in Glosa 1000 and has to be prefered.  "depila" should move to 
"Literary", too. 
The comment "Paul; Rick; Adam 2926" shows that the word "remove" is so 
important (it is in all three lists), that it should remain in "Core". 
Otherwise it would move to "Basic".  

  I do not believe that a deeper computerization makes sense. 
There is too much to correct in the data 
(mean {to mean} ---> mean {v}, ...).

Those utilities, e.g. sort uniq grep cut vi, are for easy things;
but for everything else: perl and its associative arrays!

grep 'abkekti' filename

I don't trust the English words given as equivalents.
Better to use the Greek or Latin whenever possible ...
or Ido, because it fonetisized the vocabulary similarly.

I think it is much more important whether the Glosa word
is used in compounds, e.g. BATE:

24      bat       bata       bat
12345   bat       bate       batter, beat, hit, knock, smite, strike, thrash
4       bat       bate-tem   innings
45      bat       bati       deep, walking
145     bat       bato       deep, depth <----------------- different root
1       bat       ne-bate    miss
15      batal     batalia    battle
5       batal     batalo     hind part <------------------- useless root
245     bater     bateri     battery, utensils <----------- ???
5       batiment  batimento  beating, throb
15      batm      batmo      step <------------------------ different

In this case our methods agree, since all the dictionaries
think BATE is important enough to list. But in others ... ?

But REMOVE is not a good root at all ... it is a hidden compound
of RE + MOV, and MOV does not appear as a proper root anywhere!

5      ablat       ablati    remove
5      ambit       ambiti    moving around perimeter
12345  ap          apo       apart, away, remove, skim, subtract, whisk
1      cinem       cinema    cinema, motion picture theater, movie theater
5      depil       depila    remove hair
5      et          kin-eti   moving
12345  k           ki        go, move
2345   kin         kine      go, motion, move, move oneself, whisk
4      kin         no-kine   motionless, not moving, stationary, still {not moving}
15     kines       kinesi    motion, moving
2345   mot         moti      drive, lay, move, move something, place, put, shift, transfer
4      moviment    movimento traffic
15     remov       remove    remove

Here one can see many crypt-affixes. MOVE should be the root,
RE-MOVE, MOVIMENTO (MOVE-AKTI?) are derivatives, and others
(*MOMENTUM?) should also be buildable using other good Glosa roots.

I think we need to write them as RE-MOVE, AB-LATI, DE-PILA, etc,
so we can catch those horrendous etymological errors. I am not
worried about too many synonyms, because the popularity of each
word is best judged by the number of vocab-lists it appears in.

But I might reduce the *English* synonymns to 2 or 3 max per G word.

It's good to discuss these things: sometimes you convince me,
sometimes I convince myself ...

Glosa has 2 different word-lists CENTRA and MEGA. CENTRA GLOSA has only
~GENE SKO~ as part of its list; ~APRENDE~ and ~MATI~ belong to the larger
MEGA GLOSA, and are available for those who feel the need to use them.

CENTRA GLOSA is the heart of the language, but all the international words
are part of Glosa, and all the Greek and Latin elements that make up the
Sci-Tech  vocabulary. This results in far too many words for every day use
and our current dictionary project is trying to correct this.

CENTRA GLOSA has about 1200 "concepts" and 1800 words, with some "concepts"
represented by both a Greek and a Latin word. This seems to be sub-optimal,
but it has some advantages. Some people on the list prefer to use the Latin
word and some prefer the Greek one. We can choose for ourselves which we
use. People remember more words they use, so CENTRA GLOSA works with human
language skills. We only need to use about 1200 words and to recognise in
context about 600 additional synonyms.

> We don't need in adaptatio and in ADAPTA both, we must select.

~ADAPTA~ is the CENTRA GLOSA word.

  The trick was that the program takes only the rest of the file.
Because the beginning is cleaned up already.  So when you have worked
on letters A to C for example, then A to C of "Literary", "Basic" and
"Core" is really ready.  A to C are finished, but also D to Z are
worked on (e.g. "remove" of letter R) and improved ("remove" is
removed from Core and Basic).

  So another can take all A words of "Core" (because the A of "Core"
is complete then) and do some other researches (a next step already),
maybe Greek/Latin-comparison, hyphen-use-harmonization or
synonym-optimizing.

  (Of course, you can go the same way with UNIX-commands, too.)

  I followed just YOUR own idea.  And I find it is useful.  Greek and
Latin are important, we have to do it (maybe later), but they are not
so easy to access.

  I am not so convinced about the files you use for 12345.

  glosaref.dat and classif.dat can only differ from each other and from
g1e5.dat by errors of the Glosa authors, because all three should be
Glosa 1000.

  glosaref.dat and classif.dat have been sources of Bill's dictionary
and should be completely included.  When you take gec.dat, you compare
the same with the same.

  You get only negatives (errors) and no positive information.  It is
like an experiment in physics, where somebody takes the noise of the
amplifyer for the result (happened to ME once).


 > 24      bat       bata       bat

  I wondered often, what this word means:  a stick, racket (sport)/
to beat/ the animal.  From the classical origin all is possible.
Please tell, if you know.  I needed it for the Glosa-German-dictionary.

Or maybe you can send to me the file?

Yes, one can always learn much from the mistakes of others.

But where they agree, we have more reliable data.
So we can know theat CANCRI is probably wrong in its
final vowel, because the other sources disagree.
The union of these overlapping files is the basic vocab.
Then we have all the rest, which is the Glosa-6000
plus a lot of noise.

The most important words are always verbs, because they generate
whole families of terms. BATUARE was Latin for "to beat, batter,
repeatedly smack the stuffing out of something"; this led to

combat, debate, rebate, abbatoire", ad infinitum.

we need a root BATE and the prefixes RE- AB- COM- etc.

10 further derivatives (10,000 words) by participle and such,
yet only using 50 + 20 + 10 = 80 morphemes ... Nice, huh?

Yeah, pretty nice, but...
Isn't this like reinventing the wheel? There
is nothing new here. It's like Al Gore claiming
he invented the Internet.

What I'm not sure about is that all this tweaking
of Glosa should be going on... On one hand I
would applaud the changes and welcome a sense
of accomplishment in root revival and logical 
derivation... On the other I feel like there is
a disservice being done to Wendy Ashby who
is still the copyright holder of Glosa. Why not
just make a new project language. First there
was Interglossa and then came Glosa. Why 
can't reformers simply make their own project
and stop tweaking Glosa? Perhaps call it
Kosmo-Glosa, although someone out west
might think it's too close to Kosmoglotta. 

Since,
Jay B.

I take it to be a sports implement. And so used as a verb "to use a bat" or
"to bat".

I think I didn't completely answer the question ...
I'll add on a few things here:

The authors of Glosa have (unconsciously?) included all
the standard super-productive Latin roots and prefixes
and many of the suffixes, but in a hidden manner.
Words like "REMOVE" are really "RE-MOVE", etc, and when
written with the hyphen, it is easy to sort such words
by the root (MOVE) rather than the prefix (RE) and then
suddenly all the word families become obvious. A good
example is SIGN ...

5       sign       a-signa   assign
145     sign      de-signa   design
4       sign      in-signi   ensign, flag
1245    sign      in-signia  badge, banner, flag
5       sign  kontra-signa   countersign

I am tired already, doing this manually. When all the
true "IN-" etc compounds are flagged as such, a program
will sort them all automatically.

>From such super-productive verbs are *also* derived
a huge number of useful adjectives, nouns, etc.
Not syntactically, but semantically. To "beat = BATE"
with something, a "bat = BATE-ME" (or something similar)
is useful. Normally one would use Romance "-ERO" etc.
and you can find various "-IA, -IO, -ISM" etc in Glosa.
There are many other such useful suffixes *already*
embedded in the Glosa vocab waiting to be dug out, but
they aren't as obvious or consistent as the prefixes.

bati  = bathy- = deep, depth . bathysphere [From Greek bathus 'deep']

I see no reason not to treat these two words as one Glosa word with
acceptable variation in "euphonic" terminal vowel.


Any idea where ~bati~ = waking comes from? I note that your file also has
~badisti~ = walker. Is there a common "root" there?

> But REMOVE is not a good root at all ... it is a hidden compound

The CENTRA GLOSA equivalent would be ~re-moti~, which would mean "move back
to beginning". Glosa does have the "international" prefixes as part of the
language, but gives them a specific meaning, rather than the vague meanings
of the natural languages. IMO only compounds that make semantic sense are
useful; the rest of the 'hidden compounds' (for example ~kolekti~) should be
treated as indivisible, unanalysable units.

I think the "walk" idea is just a mistake, so if corrected there
should be just one root. For the sake of a respectable dictionary,
only one vowel ending per word should be kept, I don't know or
care which; there seems no particular pattern to them.

Yes, Glosa has MOTI as well as MOVE. But consider all the possible
derivatives and ease of use ... "rebate, debate, ..." and also
"motor, motive, ...". Occidental accepts MOVE- as infinitive
and MOT- as perfective forms, then derives the family.

> Glosa does have the "international" prefixes as part of the

Glosa is the same as Latin: "cum" can be a (relatively) specific
particle, while "con-/com-" are vague prefixes. I am ambivalent
about this practice, but it's not my choice, they did it!

> IMO only compounds that make semantic sense are

I disagree: LECT is one of the important crypto-roots:
"select, collect, delect, elect ...". Each of those has further
sets of derivatives. It's designed deeply into the system.

    There is a problem with this approach.  Glosa is supposed to
facilitate communication.  Suppose we have no other language in
common.  You prefer and learn the Latin word, and I prefer and learn
the Greek word.  We still cannot communicate, the very condition Glosa
(or any other auxiliary language) was supposed to ameliorate.

    I agree.  I hold that there should be a judicious selection of base
vocabulary and then that those who favor the language should get on
with it.  The quest for "better" can sometimes be the enemy of "good
enough."

So if Occidental is good enough for you then why
not stick to that... actually if you want to tinker 
then tinker with Occidental, and if you want ideas
on what to improve in it I'll gladly send you a list
of items you can play with to your hearts content.
Ask yourself, does Wendy Ashby want you messing
with Glosa? She has copyrights. Does your buddy
Robert J. Petry Jr. C. L. have copyrights on all the
old stuff he is dredging up and reprinting? Not at 
all??? So why not tinker with your favorite creolized
lingo? One of the faults in working with the
Glosa 6000 is that the lesser list is the one that was
endorsed as ready for primetime and good enough.

How do you react when someone questions features
of Occidental? Come on do the right thing, be 
straight for a bit and come up with your own project.
Then we could give you credit as the author and
lo and behold you'd be in the Auxilingua Project
pages. Although your buddy Bob P. might not
want to play with you on Occi no more.

Jay B.

Yes, I would say, it did look a bit messy. Please
let me know if your like me to give you a hand.
We'll hack that bad boy list into submission.

But on second thought. Why not tell me what's
bugging you about Glosa so much that you 
have to change it?

BTW you haven't responded about the list of 
Occi improvements I told you so very excitedly
about. What say, mate???

You have let that lunatic provocateur mislead you ...
There isn't any tweaking going on, only collection of data
and resorting of it, and if Wendy agrees to letting somebody
correct the final vowels, then that too.

Of course everyone is free to cling tightly and religiously

  Aren't there enough unfinished language projects? 
Changing some ending vowels and re-sorting the words, is that a reason 
to give it a new name? 

  We started a project (supplement of E5kG1k to the Internet 
Dictionary), completed it and had success. 

  Now we are discussing/brainstorming about what to do next. That 
should be normal: clear up the direction first, then set the foot to 
a step. 

  The signals we get from Richmond are positive.  The copyright 
quarrel is past. 

  It is obvious: there is something moving with Glosa. 


  Dear Jay, I beg you again: please speak a Glosa text on a 
cassette.  The existing two cassettes (one Wendy/Ron, one Robin) 
have a strong English accent.  You, as a Spanish teacher, may help 
this situation.

From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2000 09:49:45 -0700


Some people dislike the Latin prefixed vague prepositions,
and find them inconsistently used and silly in Glosa,
e.g. "su facia, su-facia, surfaci, surfacia" = "surface",
and "superficia" = "superficial". I mean the whole set of
"ab- ad- de- con- pre- pro- re- sub- sur-" etc.

There may be a usable alternative in the Greek prefixes, e.g.
"dia, epi, exo". They better fit the disyllabic sound pattern
and eliminate that just-another-Romance-interlingua feeling.
I am wondering if it would be worth the effort to search
systematically for replacements, e.g. SURFACIA --> EPIFACI.

This requires mixing Greek prefixes with Latin roots,
and moves away ("ki ab") from "international vocabulary"
and at-sight recognizability. But it seems more in
accord with the original justification for Interglossa,
scientific Greek vocabulary with simplified syntax.

As it is today, I can't see how to use Glosa seriously,
it's too much of a mish-mash. I re-sorted the vocab
roughly by roots and find things like this everywhere,
even basic stuff like "make, build, face":

faba            bean
faber           artisan
fabrika         structure
fabula          myth, tale
bene-face       do good
lega-face       legislation
face            build, construct, make, manufacture, produce
face-do         factory
faci            making
facia           face, features, surface
facu u neo ra   invent
ge-face         artificial, produce
ge-face ex      consist
no-face         demolish, destroy, havoc, undo
su facia        surface
su-facia        surface
faceta          facet
faceti          witty

So now I don't know whether to consider Glosa as possible
euro-pidgin (bene-face, lega-face, fabri-domi, epi-face)
or anglo-latin (beneficial, surface, facetious, invention).
I'd really like to know how others see it ...

I don't have a problem with ~a.m.~ = ~pre meso-di~ or even = ~mana~. "a.m."
doesn't abbreviate any English words, and I guess this is the case in most
languages where it occurs. I guess we should be marking any changes from the
GEO standard, until these can be approved.

I think these root families are very interesting, but I don't see how the
meanings of the words are related in present day Glosa. They feel like they
represent distinct "concepts" to me.

Very true, _but_ everyone's reading/hearing vocabulary is larger than their
speaking/writing vocabulary and it is this size difference that bridges the
communications gap that was about to open up here.

In Glosa we don't have an untouchable "Fundamento", but a series of slightly
varying word lists. So to me, it makes perfect sense to correct the typo's,
smooth out the differences, and establish a common standard. I doubt we need
a base vocabulary that differs much from current CENTRA GLOSA as defined in
the G1KE5K file.

A parallel English example would be "meeting eating" or "eating meeting".
Only a larger context would explain what was intended.

~Kani vora.~                                     Dog(s) is/are/were/will be
eating.
~Vora kani ne es mi more.~               Eating dogs is not my pratice. Dog
eating is not my practice.
~Kani, qi vora, es de mi.~                  The dog(s), which is/are eating,
belong(s) to me. The eating dogs belong to me.
~Galina ne es boni kaso kani vora~    Chicken isn't good as a dog meal.
(~vora~ = eat = eating = a meal)

In a sense they are distinct concepts. The average person cannot
predict that "sit/stand + again/back" would mean "stay/remain".
Yet that is how Latin and Glosa have chosen: RESID and RESTA.
I would have expected "MANA = stay" for Glosa, but instead
"MANA = morning". So it is clear that Glosa accepts the Latin
word building system of a prefixed vague adverb with a root:
EMANAte, IMANE=in+mana, PERMANEnt. 

But in a deeper sense there is intuitive "natural" logic
in this system. From a small number of basic verb roots ("trunks"),
the first branches will tend to follow the lines of multiplicity
or repetition or unification or metaphorical motion toward/away.
Those are the RE- KO- etc directional prefixes, and Greek uses
them too, and so do all the "international words" ... no escape!

There were very similar processes in the Amerindian languages.
I urge skeptics to closely examine the combined Glosa vocabulary.
What I at first thought was dispensable in the Glosa-6000 words
turns out to be the most essential.

But "larger context" is never a satifactory solution in any
designed language. Even a pidgin quickly evolves an idiom
to express frequent concepts. [I reformat examples below.]

> ~Kani vora.~                  Dog(s) is/are/were/will be eating.

Is that "dog eats" or "dog's food" or "dog voraciousness"?
Glosa has no morphological part-of-speech distinctions,
so "kani vora" is a valid (but vague) noun phrase.
Thus it confuses possessives, gerunds, verbs, whatever.
I would not accept your sentence as valid except as
a "telegraphed" form of "u kani pa/nu vora".

> ~Vora kani ne es mi more.~    Eating dogs is not my pratice.
>                               Dog eating is not my practice.

Vora kani es u menace.          Voracious dogs are a menace.

> ~Kani, qi vora, es de mi.~    The dog(s), which is/are eating, belong(s) to me.
>                               The eating dogs belong to me.

That is clear but too clumsy for common use. Glosa needs
both a clear possesive and a present participle.

> ~Galina ne es boni kaso kani vora~    Chicken isn't good as a dog meal.
> (~vora~ = eat = eating = a meal)

That could also mean "chicken isn't the average dog's eating".
I think these examples have helped prove the point ...

"dog's food"     ~kani vora-ma~  ~kani sito~

"dog voraciousness"   ~kani fo-vora-volu~   ~kani fo-famina~  ~kani edace~

The 'particles' are only required if you want to be specific and context
doesn't make it clear.

I don't think ~vora~ can be understood as 'voracious'.
'Voracious' = 'very hungry' = ~fo-famina~

~medio~ is average as far as I know.
How do go you get ~boni kaso~ = average?

Another possibility would be to use ~kani~ as an imperative verb -
~Kani vora!~     Dog the meal!  (=Eat the meal like a dog would do!)

Yes, adding either -MA or FO- does make it clear.

Right, but that is maybe half of the time; people like to elide
where possible, but need a convenient idiom to specify when
needed. That can be via morphology or syntax or both.

> > Vora kani es u menace.          Voracious dogs are a menace.

I was thinking more like "biting dogs", fixated as I was on
participles. Since then, I have found -NT- embedded in so many
Glosa roots, I feel free to use that productively. Now it's
the GE- that seems redundant ...

Any run of morphologically undistinguished roots is ambiguous; this
could be "boni caso kani" + "vora", or "boni caso" + "kani vora",
or ... This is sometimes called an attachment ambiguity.

> Another possibility would be to use ~kani~ as an imperative verb -

Or more idiomatically, "Pig out! Wolf it down!" ...

True. I was attempting to use ~kaso~ prepositionally here, meaning "in the
case of". Would perhaps ~Galina ne es boni de kani vora~  have been clearer?

> > I was thinking more like "biting dogs", fixated as I was on
> > participles

And it's not that I hate dogs, really ...

> ~Kani, qi morda, es u menace.~       Biting dogs are a menace.   (ie dogs that bite)

According to the Authorities (originally Hogben),
it should be "kani; qi ..." but such abuse of a
semicolon is too foolish to even discuss.

> ~Morda kani es u menace.~    Biting dogs is a menace. (ie people that bite dogs)

Infinitive: MORDARE kani es ...

> ~Morda ex kani es u menace.~   Biting dogs are a menace.   (ie dogs that bite)

Active participle: MORDANTE kani ...

Of course, this would spoil Glosa's ability to claim that it has no grammar
or at least no morphology. But I think the authors A&C never really intended
it as a true pidgin-creole, but rather as a semi-naive relexing of English.
Hogben meant something different altogether, but his ideas were just
the outline of a very strange project, one that appealed strongly to me
30 years ago, and seems quite silly now; A&C improved it greatly.

> ~Morda de kani es u menace.~   Biting dogs is a menace.   (ie people that bite dogs)

I think the more international usage is "Morda A/AD ..."

Yes, anything that breaks up a long noun phrase will help.
I would try "Galina ne es boni PRO ...".

Changing now preferences ++ --> 1 as described, I am continuing the 
work on the dictionary.  I am slow, but it is a (little) more 
interesting thing than typing in dictionary pages.  Nick's comments 
are helpful, thanks.  I will upload the advances on my homepage 
monthly and announce it here in Glosalist. 


My first impressions, doing the ++ --> 1, do not surprise:

* A lot of inconsistencies disappear from Bill's dictionary 
  automatically only by prefering Glosa 1000. 
* Words with more than two syllables are suspicious. 
  (Most of them are Glosa-6000s containing ugly Latin 
  part-of-speech-markers.  Mostly a better two-syllable synonym 
  from Glosa 1000 can be found with the E5kG1k-list.) 
* Glosa is beautiful. 


What do you prefer for "to eat"?  "Fago", "sito" or "vora"?  Charles's 
list gives no answer.  I like "fago" most. 
("fago" is aorist to Greek "esthio", the normal verb for "to eat".  
"sito" is from the normal Greek word for food, "sitos", but a noun. 
"vora" is Latin, but the normal Latin word for "to eat" is "edo". 
The following compounds should be harmonized to only one of the three: 
fago-ma [food]{1 compound}; 
dona sito a [feed], idio sito [diet], kapti sito [bait], longi sito-va 
[through] {???}, sito-avi [fowl], sito-bo-pe [grocer], sito-fito 
[vegetable], sito-ka [pantry], sito-va [hamper], sukro-sito [pudding] 
{10 compounds, on with ???}; 
cefa vora [dinner], devora [eat rapidly] {bad prefix!!!}, homi-vora 
[cannibal], mega vora [feast], meso-vora [lunch], pluto vora [banquet], 
vespera-vora [supper], vora gra [graze], vora mo [breakfast]{9 compounds})

Compounds are important; there may be easy Glosa equivalents
for (de-)vour, voracious, herbivore, omnivore, carnivore;
esoPHAGus, sarcophagus, anthropophagy; paraSITE.
But "mangia" (munch) sounds best, though spelled oddly ...

Good. I am glad to hear this good news about the dictionary. Look forward to
seeing the updates.

Yes, I like the Greek words too. If you can have only one, then ~fago~ gets
my vote.

Yes, that's right.  ~sito~ = ~fago-ma~

~longi sito-va~ [trough]  (a receptacle for food for animals - "Trog")

This would have a "hard" G as in Get?

More likely the authors took MANGIARE from Italian.
MANG- looks like "mango". Maybe the Glosa phonology
simply does not support (should not allow) MANGIA.
Or, my proposal to use J could be invoked: MANJA.
Then there's a conflict with MANIA unless J is
always pronounced as soft-G, as it *should* be.

Glosa (Ron Clark) chose to eliminate doubled letters
and use K for hard-C. Such in-my-opinion misguided
phoneticization generates many problems like these.
I suppose the answer is to eliminate all troublesome
roots like MANGIA, because others can always be found
that *will* fit his procrustean orthography.

J, of course, is pronounced as Y in Yes.

This seems to be the key problem.  Not Greek enough, after
all.   (Cf. Iesu: Greek, Ido and Langland's English, which thanks
to the Reformation with its German origins became Jesu(s).)  A
needed letter is being wasted, here.

And I can't forbear adding:  German learners of Ido are explicitly
enjoined not to put a curly bit on the bottom of the "I".  The
letters are entirely interchangeable to them, presumably.  

(Again, that is fine, again I'm not knocking the Germans; but why
waste the letter in Glosa, an invented language in which the
matter was not historically determined, but was at the entire
option of the inventor?  Is it too late to make a needed
change?  Whence cometh, exactly, the necessity for the German J
in Glosa?)

Vulgar/Ecclesiatical Latin and the Romance languages changed
consonantal U/I into V/J, or something like that, and it seems
like a good idea to me. But we still have the C/K and G/J
"problems" in Glosa. There isn't any other way of doing soft-G,
and the -ia combination is used instead of J as originally stated.
So it is tempting to pronounce J as soft-G and say MANJA.

But I prefer the Occidental solution of using the same
old I-before-E rules we all know since childhood ...
eliminating K altogether. What is the most international
(European) method? Nobody uses K except some very few
interlinguists! Glosa is mired in a naive phoneticism.

Some of the things you say Catty really bug me. This is one
of 'em. First the Occidental solution isn't really a solution at
all. It is problem that gets set aside far too often. Jespersen
dealt with it the same way Rosenberger and even Pirro dealt
with it... that is they represented the sound as "fonetik"-ly as
possible. And there were more than a few, you can check the
Auxilingua Project Pages and get a clue about the different
language projects that did the same. It is not naive to use
K instead of a C with double sounds. It is, however, naive
to say that Occidental is the solution. If Occidental is the
solution then practice Occidental. Glosa is good enough
for me with its Ks and I see no problem in it.

Since,
Jay B.

Subject: [glosalist] other IALs of similar analytic type
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Tue, 05 Sep 2000 20:50:14 -0700


I am re-reading some of the early Kosmoglott magazines,
edited by Edgar De Wahl, deviser of Occidental/Interlingue.
In those days the IAL options were mainly Espo-Ido,
Peano's Interlingua, and Occidental in-between. In my
previous reading I skipped anything not concerning OCC,
but there were many articles by Peano and others about
(and/or written in) their own language projects.
This time I'm reading them all ... except Esperanto,
which I cannot penetrate due to its mangled roots.

Besides Interlingua's great resemblance to Glosa,
as remarked by somebody on this list earlier, I find
some other interesting foreshadowings of Interglossa/Glosa.
These were well-received and never criticized by OCC-ists;
I think EDW would be more "analytical" today than he felt
was possible then, due to prevalence of Latin in schools.

Most of this is rather easy to understand at first sight,
but some details are difficult. The most radical of the
writers is Nik Yucmanof of Petropol, in his all-lower-case
(proletarian?) language/notation "Etem". Sometimes he revues
other langs of similar type, one of which is called "Glott"
and has some interesting parallels with Glosa. (So here I'm
trying to revue a revue of a lang in a lang in a lang!)

: "glott" usu alfabet anglo-latin

: gramatik de "glott" es analitic.
: numer es indikat per numerativ (du soldat)
: aut per artikul: definit "la" (sing.), "les" (pl.),
: indefinit "un" (sing.), "plures" (pl.);
: deklin es fakat per "preposision":
: "de la patre", "ad la matre"", ...;

(More stuff too similar to Glosa deleted)

: adverbi et adjektiv ne es diferensiat;
: verb es interesant: radik de id es ekstrakt
: eks parol intereuropean ko "-or, -iv, -ur, ...",
: ergo: "amat, skript, decis, evolut ...";

(In other words, verbs are taken from the Latin
perfective/supine as is usual in English. Good idea!)

: sintakt es preferet logikal, simil a tip angl.
: stil es mult klar.

"Still"? Hmph.

: parol-formasion es simpl: sufiks et prefiks
: korespond a id de "occidental"

Which in turn corresponds to Espo-Ido.
In those days nobody dared present a project
lacking a credible system for word-derivation.

: selekt de leksik es tal: radik et parol,
: difus in omni lingu european, es akseptat
...
: in mank de parol inter-european, on selekt radik,
: komun a du famili lingual: "automne" (roman et angl),
: "fenestre" (germano-roman), "columbe" (romano-slav)

That's a refreshingly simple and effective algorithm.

This all confirms the "all eurolangs are dialects of
a single international lang" hypothesis. Nothing is
really new about Glosa, and previous analytic projects
have been better in some important ways.

Odd, that all these East-European language designers have
bypassed Greek for Latin roots, whereas Hogben and A&C ...

    That does bring up one thing which I think has been somewhat
questionable all along about the design of both Interglossa and Glosa
going back to Hogben himself, namely, the assumption that because many
people use words containing Greek roots, they somehow know the meaning
of those roots as if they were lexical atoms.  Elsewhere I have termed
this the Hogben Fallacy.  These days, I suspect that even scientists or
biological taxonomists consult dictionaries or even classical scholars
to help with the coining of new terms or Linnaean-type names.  I have
enough of a smattering of classical education that I can sometimes
recognize the roots in new coinings, but I suspect that most people
can't.  As best I recall without digging out my photocopy, Frater,
which was devised by a Vietnamese and published in Saigon, was rather
Glosa-like but leaned more to Latin roots (although with its
deliberately restricted phonology, there was a bit of mangling).

Hogben wrote in his book "INTERGLOSSA" (chapter 2) -

"Since Interglossa is an isolating (analytical) language, learning
Interglossa involves learning merely: (a) its etymology, i.e. mnemonic
association of each vocable to an internationally current root (Chapter XI);
(b) its semantics, i.e. analysis of the meaningful content of the vocables;
(c) its word-order; (d) its phonetics and typography."

This indicates to me [see (a) above] that he expected people to be familiar
with words like "telephone" and "microscope", whilst not knowing the
meanings of the elements that make up these words, since he says they must
"learn" the etymology.

"With a few exceptions the vocables of Interglossa are based on unmutilated
roots of words which now belong to the vocabulary of all countries where
modern technology and hygiene have penetrated. The meaning ascribed to any
one of them does not necessarily tally with the one given in a Latin or a
Greek lexicon. It is the meaning suggested by the internationally current
words in which it occurs."

This again indicates that the basis of Interglossa was this "international"
vocabulary and not a knowledge of Latin and Greek words.

Ashby & Clark, writing in "CENTRAL GLOSA" (page 9), give as the second
educational benefit of learning Glosa that -

"The great number of technical terms a modern student has to comprehend and
memorize get meaning through Glosa and so become easily memorable."

This must mean that they, like Hogben, did not believe that people already
knew the meaning of the Greek and Latin roots that make up these technical
terms.

In "The Loom of Language" by Frederick Bodmer (and edited by Lancelot
Hogben) writing about the favourable points of INTERLINGUA [Latino sine
flexione]

"Interlingua has NO mobile derivative affixes to juggle with. It is wholly
analytical, like Chinese or, we might almost add, Anglo-American. What
prefixes and suffixes remain stick firmly to the Latin or Greek loan-word
with all their diversity of meaning, contradictions and obscurities in
English, French, or Spanish usage."

Some one-time eminent support for my view of the inadvisability of the
attempted analysis of Glosa words into "meaningful" elements!

Greek roots were usually tiny vague formative elements, not meaningful
in themselves; even what look to us like "roots" have a substructure.
Sometimes it seems there are no roots, only thicker branches.
Even in PIE roots, which were nearly/approximately C-C, there were
families of related meanings associated with certain consonants,
especially added onto the C-C pattern (vowels were ablauted).

> association of each vocable to an internationally current root (Chapter XI);

This has a clearer meaning: Hogben was thinking like "GRAPHein = write",
which would be compounded lexically rather than morphologically, IIUC.
He did not intend separate word-roots for TELEGRAPH, PHOTOGRAPH, etc.
But it's difficult to know, since he did not stay long with the project,
and his writing is the most unclear of any professional writer I have read,
especially in its syntax.

I think he meant to have "tele-fone, mikro-fone, etc", with the roots
rather prominently exposed. People do know these roots, but they are not
specific and "scientific" as in Ido. Same for the prefixes RE- DE- etc.
The way that language works is by analogical extension, not by precise
logical definition. My degree is in math, but that sort of logic doesn't
apply to human vocabulary. Humans use a more productive natural kind
of (ana-)logic. So, I finally learn to love the vague affixes and roots.

[equivocal Hogben quote snipped]

> This again indicates that the basis of Interglossa was this "international"
> vocabulary and not a knowledge of Latin and Greek words.

Ambiguous: Are we looking at scientific combining forms like "cardio-"
or common international vulgar (90% latinate) forms like "cord-ial"?

> "The great number of technical terms a modern student has to comprehend and
> memorize get meaning through Glosa and so become easily memorable."

These build-your-vocab-through-etymology claims are nothing new.
I went through a course once ... and hated the vagueness of the affixes.
I think it is better to simply collect the word-families (which are
present even in Glosa) and let human powers of pattern recognition
work their magic:

 accessibility
 accessible
 accession
 accessory
concession
concessionary
concessive
 incessant
precession
procession
processor
 recession
 recessionary
 recessive

Now, if you pronounce each word aloud slowly, you come to know
what "CESS-" means in English, without being able to explain it
in any precise way. This is the (only) way that all language works.

> This must mean that they, like Hogben, did not believe that people already
> knew the meaning of the Greek and Latin roots that make up these technical
> terms.

I agree with your analysis, but give it a different interpretation.
The root CESS- is certainly used in Glosa as above. But because of
Glosa's, ahem, mutilated phonetic spelling, CEDERE/CESSUS=cede has
meshed with CESSARE=cease to make hash of the derivational series:

cede      cede, surrender, yield
no-cede   resolute
cesa      cease
reced     recede  go back
recense   revise book
recesi    recess
procede   forward
procesa   process
procesi   process
procesio  procession

This could be untangled by using CED- vs. CESS-, or some such;
or final vowels could be used systematically, CESE- CESA-.
It requires a reform of the whole vocabulary to cure these ills.

Good reference. But again it confuses me: at first I think of
true analytical languages like Chinese or Malay or creoles,
which use productive-compounding rather than morphological affixes;
neither Interlingua nor Glosa do that predominantly. The one uses
Latin words directly, which embed a Latin morphology minus only
the syntactic affixes, *not* minus the semantic extensions.
The other (Glosa) naively jumbles words from any random source,
with separate words for different syntactic uses ...
How you gonna use "PROLONGA" as multiple parts of speech?

> Some one-time eminent support for my view of the inadvisability of the
> attempted analysis of Glosa words into "meaningful" elements!

Except that the authors support my p.o.v. strongly in their list
of vague semantic prefixes. I already posted them here recently.
Please account for the following few examples using your theory:

palin- G    back again
para- G     beside
per-        thorough, through
peri- G     around
po-, post-  after
pre-        before
pro-        forward, favor

It isn't your fault; Glosa is just inconsistent and unprincipled.
It needs an overhaul, revision, reform, redesign; and desperately.
(I've returned to this opinion after examining vocabulary recently.)

I am thinking of gathering together thoughts from many people
about how to use and perfect "the international language".
This would be some sort of web page accessible also by email.

It would not resemble the mud-wrestling pits of AUXLANG,
and such troublesome troll-people would be excluded;
also, anonymous questions and postings would be permitted.
Most especially encouraged would be messages written in
experimental hybrids between various IALs; but likely, the
naturalistic types would predominate (Occidental, Glosa, etc).

Anyone who is interested, please contact me directly
rather than through this list, and we can make it happen.
I need a little input before commencing.

    You have a good point here.  I do not possess a copy of
"Interglossa" and have only had the opportunity to peruse a copy
hastily.  I found Hogben's style a little hard to follow.  However,
apart from what Hogben himself may have written, as you generously
quoted (and I have snipped for space), some have at least represented
Hogeben, or his following, so to speak, as if he/they were saying that
people should/would know the meanings of etymological roots.

How do you make that happen?  Moderated lists are troublesome
things.  Lotta work, lotta responsibility.  I don't think anyone
has succeeded as you intend to do.  Good luck.

One approach, possibly, would be to require the discussions to be
in "Occidental, Glosa, etc".  That would provide a barrier to idle
entry and somewhat discourage facile controversy.  Those who had
the impertinence to design a language for others without knowing a
couple of IALs themselves would choose to go elsewhere.  Those who
knew a couple would be able to handle any of the "etc" languages
that met your criteria, not without a little effort, but with a
degree of it acceptable and interesting to language designers.

That approach has, of course, been tried in the bablo list, with
only moderate success, but the bablani are by definition a less
expert group, and there is not the restriction to naturalistic
languages that you contemplate.

If you want to do it in English in an international mailing list
you need to justify the use of English as an IAL.  There is some
incongruity in an English-language list of this kind, I think.

The "naturalistic" is the bugbear.  It is there I think you will
go wrong.  I don't know if you have a clear meaning for it.  Does
it mean there will be excessively complex, or undefined, rules of
derivation, or will the words (as I think you intend) be
invariable?  Does it mean just that the vocabulary will come from
a few languages that arose in one part of the globe?  In other
words, the contrary of a priori?  If so, perhaps there is a better
word than "naturalistic".

Basically, I'm convinced that a naturalistic language can't be a
world language.  What is needed is an autonomous language, one
amenable to complete definition, and indeed, completely defined.  
Not a semi-artificial languages.

Personally I'm pretty clueless, but the only world languages I
know of are Esperanto, Ido, and Glosa.  And I'm doubtful about the
last.  Occidental is not a candidate, mea opinione.

The Glosa Internet Dictionary on my homepage has been updated. 


Changes: 

As I wrote, I changed the preferences of the synonyms ("++" and "+") in 
advantage to Glosa-1000-words ("1").  Of course, with the English 
meanings I could not really find all Glosa synonyms because of English 
synonyms (like Bill before!). 

Then, as Charles suggested (and later rejected), I took Paul's 
Base-Vocabulary-list (ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary , 
I used Charles's "mixed salad") and Rick Harrison's VITAL-list 
(http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) and put the Glosa 
words to these English words into the "Core"-dictionary.  Sometimes I 
could not find a fitting Glosa word for the English in the Internet 
Dictionary or I did not like the found word.  These missing words are 
listed (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm ).  Please have a look. 
Perhaps you know good Glosa words for them. 

Nick's comments (again thanks, follow-ups are welcome) have been built 
in as far as I was able to. 

A lot of error correcting and meaning harmonization is done.  All is 
protocoled in www.tuhh.de/~smms/gidhist.txt.gz . 

The new "Core"-dictionary has now 1991 Glosa items.  1761 of them are 
Glosa-1000s (= 88 %).  Before it was 1941/729/38 %. 
The new "Basic"-dictionary has 4634, 2695 Glosa-1000s, 58 % 
(before 5026/965/19 %).  The whole Internet Dictionary has 8481 Glosa 
items. 



I tried hard to handle the data carefully and with respect to Bill, the 
Richmonders and the spirit of Glosa.

I believe, the "Core"-dictionary is quite useful now !!! 
(Glosa-English www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcoglen.htm and 
 English-Glosa www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcoengl.htm )



... but it is far away from being ready.  Here some tasks to do. 
Some are small, some not: 

* I feel not satisfyed with all of the 1705 " + "-words ("Basic"-words, 
  not in "Core" nor in Glosa-1000).  Suggestions and help are needed. 
* There are English words in Paul's Base-Vocabulary-list 
  (ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary ) and in Rick 
  Harrison's VITAL-list (http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) 
  wich are not in the Internet Dictionary or they are there but I did 
  not like their Glosa word.  I listed these words in 
  www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm .  Good Glosa words for them 
  should be found - or created. 
* The amount of words in "Core" and "Basic" should be optimized.  
  I think, maybe 1700 for "Core" and less than 4000, maybe 3700 for 
  "Basic" would be best. 
* I have to go through Bill's mails to Glosalist about his dictionary 
  work and his considerations.  The mails are collected in 
  www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz .  Without wanting to, I 
  certainly have destroyed some good ideas when I used the Richmond 
  data.
* The "G"s (marks of Glosa words with Greek origin) should be 
  supplemented with help of the book "Glosa 6000".  Same with 
  capitalization. 
* Some synonyms are necessary for good style and feeling comfortable 
  with a language.  But in "Core" the amount of synonyms should be 
  reduced to a minimum.  Especially the phenomenon of "different roots 
  for similar concepts" is annoying.  I started to make a list of them 
  (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcosyn.htm ).  We could complete the 
  list and then fix this problem. 
* Alphabetical sorting ("{", "}", "[", "]") must be corrected. 
* The problem of "similar synonyms" (similar Glosa words with same 
  meaning, mostly differing from each other only in the ending vowel) 
  is not solved.  I started to make a list of them 
  (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ).  The list should be 
  completed.  We can build up a database of classical origins to every 
  word (word pair) and of cognated words in other languages.  
  With this data we could collect examples to every Latin and 
  Greek conjugation/declination and write a "Word Derivation Scheme". 
  A start for such a scheme is www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gwds.htm 
  (it is just what I emailed before here in Glosalist). 
  With this scheme we can choose the "right" synonym or "correct" the 
  words.  Great would be an approval by Wendy Ashby. 
* A database of classical origins and cognated words of other 
  languages should be made for the "Core"-words, too.  With the 
  "Word Derivation Scheme" we could systematize the vocabulary then 
  step by step.  

And of course:
* Correct errors
* Contact W. Ashby
* Test out the dictionary by conversation and translation work
* Translate the dictionary in various languages (German, Russian, 
  French ..)

Sakri vaka! That is a lot of work! And it is very important
to Glosa's future that somebody get into these things.
I did not intend to stop your effort, but only indicate
that other lines might be more productive. Of course everyone
can/should investigate different lines of thought.
At first I thought of catching holes (lacunas) by using the
English lists, but then went off in a different direction ...

EW mácular      JK macul        L maculare      I macchiare     E spot, stain, maculate

EW maner        JK mans         L manere        I rimanere      E stay, remain

I am thinking there really are "only" around 3000 important roots,
and any good IAL *must* use a system of derivation to generate
the 10 or so most-useful semantically related words per each root.
So, why not combine the efforts of the greatest interlinguists?
Edgar Wahl, Otto Jesperson, etc. I like to make cross-comparisons
between Ido, Glosa, and the more naturalistic IALs.

Glosa has a crypto-derivational non-system. It needs a complete
redesign and replacement, I really think so. Maybe we need to admit
that 10 or so grammatical suffixes are necessary in any language.
No human language I've ever heard of that passes the pidgin stage
does not have some affixes. In the Glosa vocab you can see
fossilized Latin -io -nt -te and others. At least the prefixes
re- ko- etc have a true and useful definition, and they generate
many useful words from roots hidden in Glosa, like LECT/LEKT
(the authors were not even consistent in fuhnettik spelling).
Of course it's always easier to criticize than build!

I am so in-agreement about this point.

A micro-study ... I did this unix command, and got a list
of 52 Glosa words, which I reformatted a bit below:

cut -f 3 glosatest* | grep -v '[- ]' | grep '.ekt.$' | sort -u

abjekti afekta aspekti aspekto
defekti dejekti delekta detekti dialekta dialekti direkti disekti
efekti ejekti eklekti elekti erekti expekta
genuflekti hekto injekti insekti inspekti
kolekti konekti konfekti korekti
lekto nekto objekti
perfekti perspekto plekto prefekta prefekto projekti
reflekti rejekta rekti respekta respekti retrospekti
sekta sekti selekti spekta subjekti suspekta
tekti tekto vekti vekto

It's a bit of a jungle, but by disentangling it
we can reduce the 52 chaotic words to 11 nice roots:
"fekt jekt lekt nekt rekt sekt tekt vekt flekt plekt spekt".

The prefixes are familiar: "ab ad de dia dis ex in ko per
pre pro re sub super", and some few compounds like "genu".
Then maybe some missing words like "kon-vekt" appear.

Obviously there are many other groups besides "-ect".
(Wouldn't they all sound nicer using Greek "apo-" for "ab-"?)
To reduce G-8000 to manageable size, we selekt/inspekt all
these sets, then look for more patterns among the remainder.
Maybe eliminate "-fika" words with "-fect", or the reverse.

Also apparent is the random final vowel situation.
I would make them all -e for etymological and mnemonic
reasons, but there is more to it ... crypto-suffixes!

    CON- is not Glosa, KON- is.
    Where prefixes are functional in constructing neologisms, then I feel
they ought to have a place.  However, the question of using the Greek or
the Latin form, in construction, is tricky.
    My two main thoughts are that both Greek and Latin forms should be
allowed, and that the "6000" lexicon should not be altered too drastically.
 Having said that I realise there could be mounted a strong case for going
through the lexicon and stripping out all cases of a non-preferred form,
e.g. all words beginning with ~ab~ where the initial letter s have an
undefined 'prefix' quality.

    However, there are two main determinants for me:-
 1. Both function words and substantives, in Glosa, should be spelt
consistently - for the benefits of both learners and programmers working on
the machine-handling of language.
 2. The ear should be the final arbiter in accepting words: when the words
are spoken in a sentence, does the sentence flow; and, is the meaning
readily grasped, from hearing the sentence?

*   I cannot tell which is the better: ~surfacia~ has an excellent
pedigree, albeit Latinate, and is readily recognisable to most speakers of
Euro-languages.
    ~epifaci~ could be the final winner because it is closer to the
"sing-song" quality of CVCVCV.  Perhaps this is the sort of question to
ask the Asian Glosa-pe.
    Whether there is space in the lexicon for three forms of the word, I am
not sure.  IE
  face     EG  Fe pa face mu sito pro mu prima-vora.
  facia        An fu face u jardina para u Nordi facia de an domi. 
  -faci        U pani-faci makina pa produce pani pro u holo komunita.

*   Mixing elements works: we got away with "television."
    But I still see the idea as using ''Classical'' roots; however, I
suspect that the use of strict derivational laws will sterilise Glosa.
While I can see that fuzzy spelling will defeat the purposes of Glosa
altogether, I still feel that one, or two, well defined, and regularly-
spelt words per concept is to be aimed at; and, this was what Ron Clark and
Wendy Ashby generally derived - albeit often through intuitive means,
rather than via a formula.

>faba            bean
>faber           artisan
>fabrika         structure
*   Maybe the first two are too close in sound, though context would
certainly sort out the bean from the being.  So, an "artisan" might be a
person who makes things, a ~fabrika-pe~.

>bene-face       do good
*   Fits the pattern, but hard to use in a sentence.
    ~U holo viki gene bene-face ex an ergo.~
    ~Fe bene-face fe sko-do ko fe kali kanta.~ 

>lega-face       legislation
*   I prefer to avoid this awkward word, by treating "laws" and "making
laws" as two different linguistic situations.
   EG  ~An sio aplika plu lega.~  He would apply the laws (legislation).
       ~Durante u lega-face procesa, fe pa skope plura mega bibli.~
        During the law-making process, she looked at several large books.


>face            build, construct, make, manufacture, produce
>face-do         factory
*   Seems OK.

>faci            making
*   If this is to be preserved, then I'd say it should be in the form of a
hyphenated suffix, IE ~-faci~.  And the only justification might be that
the long sound of the E at the end of the word is not as suitable as the
short sound of I for compound formation. 

>facia           face, features, surface
*   As faces and surfaces can be shown to be semantically related, this
word seems adequate for both usages.  And it is sufficiently distinct from
~face~, in sound and appearance, to warrant entry in the lexicon. 

>facu u neo ra   invent
*   I'd say that this U was one too many.
    Also, I don't know it source: at the time that the terminal vowel was
not fixed, an article could have been written including this spelling;
however, now that terminal vowels are prescribed, this "Old Glosa" should
be 'retired.'

>ge-face         artificial, produce
>ge-face ex      consist
*   Not sure of the sources of these usages: they just dont feel right.
Firstly, the ~ge-X~ form has been fairly well discussed on this list to be
the Glosa equivalent of the 'past participle' in English: I'd say either
these definitions are in error, or are archaic.
  EG
 Id pa gene ge-face intra Deutschland.
 Durante u holo di fe pa produce solo tri itema de vesti.
 U tegu-vesti ne dona termo, ka id es ge-face de no-natura textili.
 U di produce, de u holo face-do, eqa six kilo unita.
  &
 U sani-bibi gene ge-face, per u paleo andra, ex plura natura herba.
 Id konsiste de poli pusi mero de vitri, ge-jugo ko fo poli longi mero de   
   tenu metali-fi. 
 U kali modela de u facia pa gene ge-face ex mo mero de ligni.  

>no-face         demolish, destroy, havoc, undo
*   Don't know if I can agree with these definitions: ~no-face~ distinctly
means "un-make", and while we might 'un-make' a bed, we need a much more
drastic word to describe pulling down a building.
  EG
 U gina pa no-face u kli; qi pa previo gene ge-face ex fe fe-fili.
 U milita-pe pa destru u ge-tekto-ra, per explode id.
 An pa es u fo laxi andra; qi holo-tem pa somni intra u no-ge-face kli.
 Tri andra fu demoli, brika ex brika, u kloro ge-kroma domi. 
 U hero pa no-liga u forti liga-fi; peri fe plu karpus.

>su facia        surface
>su-facia        surface
*   More problems: "6000" gives 'SURFACE facia' and 'FACIA face, surface'.
    Strictly speaking, the ~su facia~ is the space above the surface.  
  EG
 Intra u su facia de u gra agri, na detekti plu kilo de pusi insekti.
 U ju-an singu di pa re-veni ad an domi ko u su-facia lamina de sordi.

>faceta          facet
>faceti          witty
>
*   O.K. if the Glosa lexicon allows for entries that differ only in their
final vowel.  If, as here, the menings are quite distiinct, then context,
as well as the final vowel, will separate the words.

>So now I don't know whether to consider Glosa as possible
>euro-pidgin (bene-face, lega-face, fabri-domi, epi-face)
>or anglo-latin (beneficial, surface, facetious, invention).

*   For the first question, I would take 50-50 odds: for vocabulary, Glosa
is a sort of Classico-creole; while for its construction, it is more Anglo,
but not very Latin.
    Imagine a time .. in prehistory .. when early man though little before
uttering, and barely distinguished between things and their actions.  In
such a mystic stage of evolution, the concepts echoing thought were also
closely related to the sounds used to convey these thoughts: it is
postulated, here, that proto-man used proto-language in a very loose way,
such that metaphorical usage blurred the boundaries between the concrete
and the abstract, and simple, largely un-inflected sounds were used to
string these thoughts together.
    Now imagine a time .. in post-history .. when civilised man painfully,
urgently seeks to rediscover the fundamentals of communication to
facilitate intercommunication between groups whose long linguistic
evolutions have driven them apart.  In such a time there will be attempts
to impose the most evolved of civilisation's national languages on all;
alternatively, there will be attempts to marshal the best linguistic
features into one superior language; while others will suggest a return to
some form of linguistic Lowest Common Denominator.
    As I see it, Glosa represents the thrust from this last group.  To get
man talking to man, we might have to take a few steps back - to a level of
sophistication where people from all linguistic traditions can cope.

Saluta,

Robin

Would it perhaps be more in the spirit of Glosa to use detached
word-classifier particles?  I'm thinking of something like

		agent shop = shopper
		noun reciprocate = reciprocate
		verb bath = bathe

But thinking of the last, this approach would be rather difficult.  
You would start with "bathe", and use the classifiers "place for
it" (bath), "doer of it" (bather), perhaps.  And "fixer of"
"container for" "doing of" cook = tinker.  Sorry I mentioned it.

If so, is not Glosa fatally flawed?  It seems to me that the only
alternatives are it's remediable or it's fatal.

Glosa has derivation, the problem is that it's not designed in,
it's naturalistic, and the significance of the denied affix must
be acquired along with the root as a single concept.  If we
confessed that we had roots and pre-defined affixes we would have
a more intelligible language.

Look at Sweet's chapter on derivation in English.  Look at the
treatment of that chapter in the synoptic table of contents,
giving page references to, what, 180 affixes.

Is that what you want for Glosa, the need for someone to write a
large book describing the language found in the wild, or do you
want an IAL with a simple and complete definition?

P.S. I mean Sweet's "New English Grammar".

Perhaps you are right.  But is what Bodman says true?  Isn't it
just denial?  Aren't the affixes alive and well?  When he says an
affix sticks firmly he presumably don't mean that that affix is
never found molesting another root, but that neither root ever
consorts with another affix, nor appears in public naked.  Is that
really true?

Glosa claims to be a global IAL. As such it must meet some criteria,
it's own and those of its potential users. Seems to me that Glosa
is not true to its own principles, thus the problem. The result
is that nobody can actually write in it without extreme difficulty.

I see no reason to design a new language. The international language
(European style) aleady exists. Glosa barely qualifies as a dialect.
Novial, Occidental, and both Interlinguas are the prime examples.
People can speak any combination of these and be mutually understood.
With somewhat careful selection of vocabulary, they can be adapted
to speaking with native Euro-language speakers who have not even
studied any interlingue or even heard tale of such.

Glosa is not defensible in its current state, it needs redesign work.
I push for: 1) Identify what Glosa's principles are; 2) Follow them.
Examination of the extended vocabulary reveals chaos. There are
obvious ways to fix the problems. I will not accept any "Hands-off!"
statements of people who do not actually support and use the language.
I've tried to use it, and now re-affirm that it does not work, as-is.

> Glosa has derivation, the problem is that it's not designed in,

Good points here and about Sweet, and I agree, so I delete them.

I wonder if my last message made it to the list?
Maybe wasn't so unusually interesting as I thought ...
At risk of boredom, here it is again:

------------------------------------------------------

A micro-study ... I did this unix command, and got a list
of 52 Glosa words, which I reformatted a bit below:

cut -f 3 glosatest* | grep -v '[- ]' | grep '.ekt.$' | sort -u

abjekti afekta aspekti aspekto
defekti dejekti delekta detekti dialekta dialekti direkti disekti
efekti ejekti eklekti elekti erekti expekta
genuflekti hekto injekti insekti inspekti
kolekti konekti konfekti korekti
lekto nekto objekti
perfekti perspekto plekto prefekta prefekto projekti
reflekti rejekta rekti respekta respekti retrospekti
sekta sekti selekti spekta subjekti suspekta
tekti tekto vekti vekto

It's a bit of a jungle, but by disentangling it
we can reduce the 52 chaotic words to 11 nice roots:
"fekt jekt lekt nekt rekt sekt tekt vekt flekt plekt spekt".

The prefixes are familiar: "ab ad de dia dis ex in ko per
pre pro re sub super", and some few compounds like "genu".
Then maybe some missing words like "kon-vekt" appear.

Obviously there are many other groups besides "-ect".
(Wouldn't they all sound nicer using Greek "apo-" for "ab-"?)
To reduce G-8000 to manageable size, we selekt/inspekt all
these sets, then look for more patterns among the remainder.
Maybe eliminate "-fika" words with "-fect", or the reverse.

Also apparent is the random final vowel situation.
I would make them all -e for etymological and mnemonic
reasons, but there is more to it ... crypto-suffixes!

It did, and FWIW this is also a Linux system.  Your cut pipe is a
good demo of the power of sh and the Unix utilities.

Your classification of '?ekt' roots appears sound (to a naive
observer).  Keep up the good work.

> Obviously there are many other groups besides "-ect".

There's a difference?

The Greeks a pretty good at swallowing vowels.  In practice the
"apo" would be pronounced "ap" in many cases.  So you are arguing
for a voiceless "b" instead of a voiced "b".

Most of the A- vocabulary is either AB- or AD- plus verbal root.
The AD- tends to assimilate nicely and all the IALs allow A=AD.
But AB- is fairly ugly to pronounce, whereas AP(O)- is flexible,
sounds better and has exactly the same meaning. It would make
auto-hyphenation (and thus identification of roots) much easier.
But even a small change like that would rattle cages; even though
Glosa supposedly favors Greek ... It was just a thought.

I do argue for identifying all those hidden roots, and
either a(d)-cept-ing or e(x)-ject-ing the whole lot.

What he is saying is that they cannot be used actively to form new words,
and this is a GOOD thing because their semantic content is so vague that any
new words formed with them, could not be understood as easily as a compound
or phrase formed from words which have a definite meaning.

Robin Gaskell grafo (mikro mero)
> the "6000" lexicon should not be altered too drastically.

For me, the description of G6000 in the Glosa Publications list is
instructive.
"6000 Greek and Latin Words and Roots which occur in the Euro-languages and
the International Scientific Terminology"
"Readership:
This dictionary gives the meanings of Greek and Latin roots used in
medicine, biology, plant and animal names etc. Suitable for educationalists,
students, linguists and for Glosa enthusiasts."

This tells me that G6000 has never been intended to be the "heart" of Glosa.
It is just a interesting exercise to demonstrate the "Hogben Principle" that
there is no need to invent an international vocabulary as an excellent one
already exists and has been waiting to be more widely used for at least the
last three centuries (i.e. the Vocabulary of Science).

In contrast the Glosa Publications list gives as the readership for CENTRAL
GLOSA
"Readership:
Ideal for beginners of Glosa, advanced students and teachers of Glosa."

This tells me that G1000 IS the "heart" of Glosa. Hogben's aim was always
for a language for all the world, and so one having the greatest possible
word economy, and a rationally constructed word list that would cover all
the essential words of intercommunication. The language should contain a
judicious selection of general terms and descriptive periphrase for specific
uses.

Ashby and Clark write "The authors consider that the Glosa presented here in
this book (CENTRAL GLOSA) is the most important Glosa....Glosa 1000. By
calling it Central Glosa it is hoped that the reader will never lose sight
of its central importance. If Glosa is to become truly Interglosa, the
International Auxiliary Language, it must remain simple. Comfortable
westerners might quickly get lost in Mega Glosa, forgetting the baser
degrees by which they ascended."
  "We hope that students who might get involved in the seeming luxury of
Mega-Glosa will quickly work up to Central Glosa, which involves clear
thinking."
  "Glosa 1000 is not only capable of great accuracy, but is also capable of
any degree of subtlety."

My understanding of the term "Mega-Glosa" is that it is all rest of the
"international" words that we might want occasionally to use for euphony or
variety. This is said to be a very large vocabulary of words, and clearly
goes beyond those words listed in the G6000 book.

    What do you see as Glosa'a own principles?

    ???  I have seen written Glosa by Ashby and Clark, Gaskell, and
others.  I never inquired whether they thought they had "extreme
difficulty" in writing it, but it certainly seems to me to be eminently
writable.  I am very poor at retaining vocabulary, which is the primary
reason I write very little in *any* conIAL.  Once there is a more
agreed upon selection of central vocabulary, I might give it a try
again.  But apart from a judicious selection of vocabulary from already
existing materials, I see no pressing need to make changes in the
language itself.

    There is no such thing as a "perfect" auxiliary languae: one
person's "necessary feature" is another's "fatal flaw."  If, once
again, Akkadian were to become a widely used auxlang, and if I had
enough need, I would try to use it, Semitic grammar and all.

    In which case, to be honest, it puzzles me as to why you are active
here.  So far as I know, you have been a vocal advocate of Occidental.

    Oh?  Several years ago I successfully used Glosa with two letters
each way from and to a man in China who said that he knew little (if
any) English (and I know no Chinese language).  It certainly worked
then.

I can't find any. I was once enthusiastic about Hogben's
original ideas, but they were largely jettisoned by A&C.
After a long time I came to like A&C better, and took it
as a naive groping after pidgin/creole. Now it is clear
(from vocabulary) that theyhad no such plan. So, I dunno.

It is an extremely poor English relex, replete with impenetrable
idioms; I tried parsing this one in excruciating detail, once:

But with a proper design, very little learning should be needed
for any European, because we already know all those word-roots
through Greco-Latin derivative words in English; they are even
more transparent to other eurolang speakers. And apparently,
the authors say this version of Glosa is *not* yet "Interglosa",
the global IAL, so this must be the euro-regional version!

Here is how to do the vocab: list prefixes, suffixes, roots.
But please *not* 6000 randomized "word stems", or 27000 as in Ila.
Here are 26 magnificent roots, to be multiplied by 10 prefixes
apiece, times 10 suffixes on the average, yielding 2600 useful
and immediately recognizable words, most of which *are* in Glosa
but *hidden* by the amateurish pseudo-phonetic spelling:

act auct coct dact dict duct fact fect fict flect flict fract frict
ject lect nect pact pict rect sect spect suct tect tract vect vict

But many are missing from Glosa, like "convect". We sense these
lacunae in the vocab but can't find them, because there is no
discernable system to it. So I recommend we impose a rational system,
derived/extracted/analyzed/extrapolated from the existing G-vocab.
According to my reading of the materials, users are justified
and permitted/allowed/encouraged to do exactly that.

> There is no such thing as a "perfect" auxiliary lang

But there are better and worse. Esperanto and Glosa-present are
not even good enough to withstand a stiff breeze (of fresh air).
But at least Glosa is reformable; it has some resources for evolution.
Any language that cannot be evolved is flat-out *dead*.

Occidental did not resist reform, it encouraged it.
Eventually most adherents went over to Gode's dictionary.
But one cannot actually learn a dictionary, one needs a system.
Naturalism is the right path, I am certain, because no other way
will work for most adults, who have *no* time to re-learn vocab;
we must find it already deep within our native languages.
Glosa accepts this pan-euro-vocabulary, but tries to impose
analytic (English) syntax upon it, with *good* results.
Occidental also uses such analyticism, to a lesser degree.

To reform the vocab means making some *changes* to it. I am
highly amused that people whine whenever this is actually attempted!

Me too, but I meant as a real living language, not just a code book.
The international language of Europe must be spoken and heard, not
just talked about or practiced like algebra or crossword-puzzles ...

The source for this is the 1993 book Central Glosa. Unfortunately a typo as

Re "prescribed terminal vowels" - What makes you think that that is the

even within the a few page in the same section of a book.

These are from the same 1993 book.
"artificial", as in ~plu ge-face flori~ or ~u ge-face lingua~
"produce" - this is shown as ~u ge-face~, therefore produce in the nominal
sense, as in, ~U ge-face de face-do gene fero per trena.~
"consist", this is another of the "definition translations", perhaps this
can be expanded into, ~U sukro-sito pa gene face ex plu banana e sukro

Of course, ~no-~ is used to form opposites in Glosa, where as English "un-"
usually only shows negatives, which is not the same thing. So if ~face~
means "make", the opposite would be "demolish, destroy", and if ~face~ can
mean "do", its opposite would be "undo". "Un-make" as in "un-make a bed" is
surely only ~no-sistema u kli~. "Havoc" = "widespread damage, destruction,
or devastation" and so fits in fine as the opposite of "make".

Scientific vocabulary was Hogben's intent. Also, analytic syntax.

This is true, and fantastic. But the implication is that
literate Europeans do not need to learn it, they already know it.
This takes it all out of the hands of language creators!

> G1000 IS the "heart" of Glosa.

G1000 is a set of example words, most unrecognizable.
It is a poor collection of international words or roots.

Simple in syntax, yes. Also the vocab should not need to be
learned as if it were an apriori or artificially-mangled list.

> the term "Mega-Glosa"

Where's the "Micro-Glosa" that people might really use?
Sorry, I'm feeling hyper-critical lately. Glosa needs
reform! Here's my idea for people to shoot at:

1. Determine to what degree a pidgin/creole is desired.
This would be ideal for a global auxlang.
But it's not an all-or-none proposition.

2. Determine to what degree at-sight-recognition is desired.
This is ideal for a regional (euro-) auxlang.
Only a lunatic would start from apriori ... hmm.

3. Now design a grammar in accordance with 1 & 2.
Try it, test it, use it, but don't "defend" it.
Instead, identify weak points, change them, iterate.

4. Provide a usable lexicon. This is where Glosa fails.
But it is correctable.

So, I would start with Glosa as-is, and reform the vocabulary
to use well-defined roots and affixes. I think a list of
500 *recognizable* roots and under 100 affixes and particles
is sufficient for Micro-Glosa. If it really worked at all,
people would be posting in it from day one. New roots would be
suggested and added, unproductive/troublesome ones dropped.

Perhaps this would be an acceptable idea for the list:
People should nominate their own favorite roots and write
short paragraphs *using* them. Then we read and steal
from each other, augmenting our personal dictionaries.
Results might be very surprising.

    You could always try resurrecting Interglossa.  Seriously (not

    I think this is an artifact of the users, not of the language
itself.  For example, some native English speakers just cannot seem to
break themselves of the habit of always marking verbs for tense or
nouns for number, but that habit is certainly not the fault of Glosa. 
Importing impenetrable idioms is also sloppiness on the part of users,
not built into the language itself.  If I try to import English idioms
into French, it is certainly not the fault of the French language if
people in Montreal or Lyons have trouble understanding me.

    But if Glosa is to be a global IAL, as some poeple might wish, then
a lot of those Greco-Latin words are not going to be very familiar to
other than "eurolang speakers."  Your position seems to be rather
heavily weighted in favor of native speakers of what Leo Moser has
called the WENSA languages.  If all you want is an IAL for WENSAns,
well, then Occidental or Interlingua would probably serve adequately.

    Even this may be a matter of opinion and familiarity as to which
language is "better" and which is "worse."  And in the end linguistic
characteristics are not going to be the primary determinant of whether
an auxiliary language comes into widespread use or not.

    Oh, I don't know.  Esperanto has lasted for 113 years and has quite
a few periodicals and published works, with probably at present more
users than all other conIALs put together.  Like it or not -- and I
don't particularly -- Esperanto certainly works for the purposes to
which its speakers put it, and I doubt that it is going to disappear
from the conIAL scene anytime soon.

    Evolution or change of fiat by people who don't happen to like this
feature or that?  IALdom is replete with the corpses of language
projects by people who thought they could do a better job.  No
constructed auxiliary language is ever going to be able to satisfy
everybody in all its features.

    Ask Bob Petry about reforming Occidental by those who are not
already active supporters and users of it.

    So monoglot adult speakers of Mandarin, Turkish, Aymara, and Tamil
will not have to relearn vocabulary for your European-based IAL?  Or
are you not targeting them?  Again, if all you want is an IAL for
WENSAns, I suggest sticking to Occ or Ia.

    Or maybe, rather than whining, they are really asserting that all
that needs to be done is select more judiciously from already existing
materials.  People are not whining just because they disagree with you.

Once again I must call you to account on your
post Catty. Bob P. is resisting reform of Occi.
Just check out occidental{at}egroups{dot}com{dot} Please
get your facts straight. Most adherents of Occi
didn't go over to a dictionary. They did adapt
to the more scientifically derived spellings used
by the IED, but they also adopted the more 
neutral and better suited grammar found in 
Gode/Blair's "A Grammar of the International
Language". Put yourself in their shoes... if you
had to would you choose... "strax" or "rapide",
"flicca" or "puera". If you chose the more
international form you'd be adapting to and
accepting the Interlingua form. 

The latinicity of a lot of Internationally shared
words in the languages of Western nations is
a strength of languages like Interlingua and
Glosa. This I know you wouldn't disagree
with, otherwise you'd be showing your 
prejudice for a language in which one's 
whims cause vocabulary choices that are
not international, such as "flicca" and "strax".

In my opinion Glosa is a simplified form 
of that shared vocabulary. Much like Basic
English is a simplified form of Standard
English.

If you can't understand this then perhaps
this is the reason for a lot of your criticism
of Glosa.

Since,
Jay B.

Yes, I've done the same. It is certainly very far from Hogben's rigidly
fixed syntax, and imposible to devise a neat set of simple rules from. But
is it "replete with impenetrable idioms"? I have seen some "shocking"
anglicisms from time to time, but it is not unusual for second language use
to be infuenced by your first language.

Re "Relexing" - Robin has said more than once that Glosa translates word for
word into English, but English cannot be translated word for word into
Glosa. If you look at your Glosa quote above, and compare it to the English
original -

"it may seem" becomes ~posi id feno~
"that" becomes ~qi~
"cover"  becomes ~sati~
"essential words" becomes ~nece volu~
"yet" becomes ~sed~
"say" becomes ~posi~
"assumes aquaintance with" becomes ~uti~
"perhaps" becomes ~minimo~
"some" becomes ~proxi~
"It requires no lengthy scrutiny" becomes ~Pe ne nece stude id mega tem~
"material" become ~lista~

This seems to suggest that meaning is being translated, not words.

http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/i0.html

I agree, but I no longer believe Greek is useful in an IAL
except for the scientific combining-forms/prefixes;
as a base, it only conflicts with superior Latin roots.
Its adjective-noun hyphenation order (PROTO-PLANET) is
very English and nice, but A&C do not use it consistently.

> Importing impenetrable idioms is also sloppiness on the part of users,

I tried to re-phrase those idioms myself but could not,
because one really needs a few clear participles or verbal-nouns
or *something* like grammatical affixes, which Glosa has few of.
I would be willing to try a pure pidgin/creole style for a
global IAL, but currently Glosa does not really claim to do that ...

Yes. I and some other auxlang people have dreamed of a global IAL,
but it seems unattainable. Glosa certainly has no claim to a
powerful derivational system, which is needed for an IAL.
Bahasa Indonesia is light-years ahead, and used by 100 million
people, in everyday life ... today already! A&C speak of "Mega-Glosa"
the way I speak of playing centerfield for the New York Yankees.

> Shades of Esperanto with its conglomerated words!

Not *that* bad ... the Romans were very practical people.
They (de- re- etc + lect flect etc) are equivalent to English
phrasal verbs, but fully international. Not a philosophical
ideal, I grant readily. But you can *remember* the entire
vocabulary rather than *memorize* it.

> Esperanto has lasted for 113 years and has quite

Only 20,000 active users, insignificant but noisy.

Same thing. Majority rules.

Bob is great, but majority rules. I happen to mostly agree
with him, and much prefer the Occidental of De Wahl to the
gutted stinking fish of Ric Berger's Interlingue. But I am
saying much the same thing about Occidental as Glosa: use those
super-productive practical Roman verb roots that everybody
already knows, and obtain true at-sight comprehension.
I have sanction for this from the authors of both languages,
because they have included those forms. You would need to
anti-reform (de-struct) Glosa to remove them, actually.

Turkish, Arabic, Putongua, Hindi. It is only the sad Europeans
who do *not* have an IAL!!!!!!!! Of course I do think it is
nonsense to think of a global IAL before a regional European.
The authors themselves put global Interglosa in the future.

You appear to be thinking of naturalism as the alternative to
apriorism.  To me it is the alternative to autonomy, to complete
definition.  It has very little to do with whether words have come
out of Europe or out of a machine.

I am perplexed by the enduring attraction of naturalism.  It seems
so obviously mistaken, at least as it applies to word derivation,
and a refusal to fully define the language.  What's wrong with
defining it?

Naturalism means that people from non-European linguistic groups
don't only have to learn the vocabulary.  That is hard work if the
words are all alien, but at least they are there in the
dictionary.

But naturalism, I think, means that they must somehow acquire
linguistic practices that are nowhere defined and are not capable
of simple definition.  I just don't understand it.  Naturalism
turns its back on a world interlanguage, aiming only for a
regional one.  And for what?  I just can't see the decisive
benefit which would justify such an extreme trade-off.

There is at least one (perhaps only one) autonomous and simple
IAL.  It is almost fully defined, almost totally excludes the
need to infer unstated rules from one's native language.  It only
falls short of absolute autonomy, as far as I can see, in the
existence of a very few French idiomatic phrases, which are,
however, expressly set forth in its 'Complete Manual'.

What is the matter with such a language?  Why not just learn it,
and move on?  What on earth is the attraction of naturalism?  Why
the die-hard supporters of a concept that as far as I can see
hasn't got a feather to fly with?  Is this science?

The question of learning or re-learning vocabulary is an insoluble
one.  There is nothing for it but to do it.  But at least there is
the dictionary.  Everything is defined, you know what you know and
what you don't, and in the latter case you know what to do about
it.

This is where the minimal vocabulary theories, the Basic English
stuff, can make a contribution.  The selection of the core
vocabulary, the first thousand or so words, is very important.  
The insistence on simple language, the refusal to import into the
language words meeting every subtlety of meaning, is also very
important.

But we get nowhere criticising the West European or WENSA
provenance of the words.  They have to come from somewhere.  If
they were taken in a democratic and even-handed way from every
language of the world, or if they were generated a priori, they'd
be difficult for everyone.  To make them easy for some is not a
crime.  

If you would prefer them to be easy for someone ELSE, show me all
the Hindi-based and Cantonese-based IALs.  There was nothing to
stop people from designing them.  India has about 12 major
languages, surely a fertile field out of which the IAL concept
could have arisen.  But the fact is that the concept and the
implementations have come out of Europe.

I'm sorry this is so off-topic.  Let's get back to Glosa.

Of course they do.  The whole world does.  It has English, a
grammatically rather simple language.  It is at least on a par
with those you mentioned.  And Hindi does not seem to have huge
penetration, even in India, nor, AFAIK, is it a good candidate.  
Why do you call it an IAL?

But I didn't think this was about natural languages that had made
it as international languages.  They are usable, but almost never
used well, by non-native speakers.  I think another of Bodman's
gems is that English is the easiest language in the world to learn
to the level of simple communication.

Subject: [glosalist] Translating into Glosa
From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 16 Sep 2000 19:42:52 -0700


I was looking at this bit by Edgar De Wahl, written
in the constantly evolving Occidental of 1925.
It is no-way pidgin, neither is it unusually
sophisticated in sentence structure:

: Li ver economie ne consiste
: in payar vili precies a reciver brac e desvaloralia,
: ma in acquisition del max bon e durabil materie o instrumente
: quel posse persister in omni occasiones.

So here I have tried to translate into Glosa,
using only *attested* vocabulary:

: U veri economi ne konsiste
: in paga vili preci a gene brakte e no-valu kosa,
: sed in aqire de maxi boni e dura materia alo ru
: qi posi tenacio in omni okasio.

The words "economy consist tenacious/persist occasion"
are all official Glosa, not compounds of my devising.
The words "u alo ru qi" are the sorest thumbs, IMO.
But even the recognizable latinate words suffer from
lack of appropriate endings so the syntax is vague.
Probably needs more particles. But I'm tired already;
every latinate word has unpredictable spelling,
so each word must be looked-up. Oddly, only "persist"
seemed to be missing, though "receive" has only
"gain" as an equivalent, qi es ne boni. Like Ila,
Glosa tethers the user to the dictionary.

One wants a high degree of naturalism, but also of regularity.

For a well-defined language, Lojban; but it is absurd.
Ido is not so regular as one might think, though it tried ...
Ido "naturalized" Esperanto's vocabulary (made the roots more
recognizable) but the affixes are apriori and not rigorous.
Occidental merely naturalized/regularized the affixes.
Glosa has very little use for suffixes; does it work?

One doesn't have to learn it, only recognize it.
It is minimal effort for maximal results.
A sphere has the highest volume per surface-area ratio.
Glosa can/must/does use these "international words",
but it needs more regularity.

Skip that step, we already know the words.
Think of English words with -ion or -ive or -able.
They are usually latinate. They are international.
You can use them with people who speak no English.
And they form big beautiful word-families, which
one can study in a mass rather than individually.

> The selection of the core
> vocabulary, the first thousand or so words, is very important.

Exactly: re- de- con- etc. -LECT- -FECT- etc.
100 of these are worth 10,000 of the other type.

No good, adults need real adult language. The latinate
words embedded within all eurolangs form a full vocabulary.
Language teachers have us convinced we need to invest years,
when a single weekend will do.

> if they were generated a priori, they'd

Exactimen.

And embedded within the Glosa-8564 we find also those
latinate super-productive internationally-known words.
They just need some polishing and a spotlight.
And then, maybe a few nice regular+natural suffixes ...
Let's take the best from Ido (regular word-composition)
and try to find that in Glosa; prefixes are already done.

In your dreams Catty...  
Learn the words and use them. 
The text in Occi you quoted I 
could write in I-gua without much 
change or "looking up" ... which
if you can use Occi without
looking up then what's your
beef with Interlingua? Frankly,
your statements are flawed. 
Since Occi and Interlingua
share almost 95% of the 
vocabulary, as per Bob P.
your pal, it stands to reason
that you wouldn't be looking
up a lot if you already know
Occidental. 

But I rather think that it is
out of your biggoted dislike
of Interlingua that you state
non-truths like the one above.

If you learn the Glosa vocab
then you would have no need
to constantly look things up.

That you do not wish to, says
volumes about your attitude 
and your bringing up Occi
at every occasion possible.

Learn the languge, man, then
complain about it. You seem
to complain about what you 
do not understand. Ignorance
is no base on which to stand.

How lame Catty! 

I am a language teacher, and a single 
weekend just wont do. You need to
learn and practice a language. Both go
hand in hand, learning and practicing
you can't have one without the other.

That the volume of shared International
roots can be found out in a weekend is
simply misinformed and at worst a lie.
You've been reading too much of Bob
P.'s propaganda, I think.

Give Glosa more than a weekend and
then tell me about it. Otherwise stick
to your Occi, which from what samples
I've read you can't even use properly,
and how many weekends did that take
you? You need more practice, bud.

Maybe so, but it sounds as if you had far too many beans
last night. Or so I hear it... A bunch of Latin roots thrown
in chain-gang fashion impress nobody. I salute you on not
even looking at the dictionary for those spellings, now what
do you want a medal? Get real, Catty! Give the fireworks
word-stock a rest. Easy is when vocab flows and is easy
on the ears, your sample above, in my opinion, flows like
diarhea. Smooth and easy maybe but it leaves a big stink!

No, you got it all wrong, Catty. Glosa 1000 is a base
vocab for communication and practice. The Glosa 1000
helps the user to become acquainted with the mechanics
of the language. This is the means of learning a language
which infants use. Learn a pattern, practice a pattern, use
the pattern to form and communicate original thoughts.

What you are talking about in your last paragraph is
creating your own project... maybe it would be called
Cat-glosa, or maybe Auli-catty... Maybe you could
call Bob P. up and get his opinion, he's pretty good
at renaming things.

To be brief, I'll respond on this only.  Simple does not mean
childish.  Charles Dickens wrote a number of books in which people
agree to meet, in the street and elsewhere, but inexplicably he
always (I think) avoided the word "rendevous".  If I'm not
mistaken, Thomas Hardy is another good example, and I expect that
many accomplished authors would fit the pattern.  Simple writing
is forceful.  They say the Bible has a small vocabulary, yet it
deals with a great variety of public and private life.  Again
there is life in the street, there are meetings, and troops
assemble, but never rendevous.

The best writing is simple and direct, but people, those of not
the highest linguistic endowment, i.e. very, very many people, are
perpetually attracted to redundant coinings which can become
fashionable.  They seem essential, because they are exactly of the
context and the time, but they are totally unnecessary.

There are also redundant pairs, such as 'ox' and 'beef', 'sheep'
and 'mutton', that seem essential to English speakers, yet result
from a non-linguistic cause, an accident of history.

If we don't carefully exclude what is really inessential, what is
redundant, we insupportably increase the vocabulary of the
language.

Of course there is much of the world of the last 1000 years, and
of modern technology, that is not encompassed by the vocabulary of
the Bible.  We need new words, but we must be discriminating, not
admit what is inessential.  Our test should be severe.

*   I agree with the 'inconsistent,' at least as far as some spelling goes,

    Unfortunately the appearance of indiscipline comes from the
Glosa-Central attitude to learner usage.  I prefer to 'correct' people's
usage, when I meet irregular usage, but do not always do so.  The worry for
Ron and Wendy, in the absence of a printed grammar book, was to avoid
upsetting neophytes with tedious corrections. 
    By writing the Seminars #1 and #2, I attempted to help with
standardisation of Glosa usage: I'm not sure if this was an attempt to
discipline the language or the users.
    I guess that this conundrum is a major stumbling block in a language
that lacks morphological grammar, and which depends, for its regularity, on
the innate language sense of the utterers.

*   I guess that this suggestion of Jays is a somewhat radical, if possibly

    At the time I was getting frustrated with Glosa (~1984 - 1990), it was
because of a string of changes to the language.  About 1992, I thought that
the language had been standardised, and had reached its final edition. Then
I prepared the seminars at the request of some Ugandans, who wanted more
guidance in the use of the language.  
    After that, I tried to tabulate the grammar, and sought to extract an
'English --> Glosa' version of the "Glosa 6000" list: it was about this
time that I became aware more work was necessary.
    Now, again, Charles is getting frustrated with the language, but this
time, because it is not changing, and it ought to be.

    After Olympic Madness has departed from Sydney, I must concentrate hard
on these present questions.

Saluta,
   Robin

*   While I can agree with Charles' desire for a "good" standardisation
between Classical source and latter-day Glosa, I feel that, taking the
sophistication of Civilisation into account, we cannot always go back to
the purity of using the exact forms of the Classical roots in Glosa.

    The Classical world was fairly meagre, when it came to concepts - by
contrast with our modern technological Civilisation.  So, I fear this
historical development requires us to ^fill in some of the cracks^ between
the basic Greek and Latin roots.

    Regarding CEDE and CESA I could make out a case for saying that 'moving
ones position' and 'stopping' are ^two sides of the one coin^.  Hence,
right from the start, these two concepts could have been intertwined and
even used interchangably.

>cede                         cesa                 recense

   I can imagine seeing the bottles moving .. and stopping .. on the
assembly line.  This would allow for the *forward movement* and continual
*stopping* as the contents were squirted into the bottle during the filling 
"process" (PRO - CESA).

*   I might say it a little differently.  By understanding the etymology of
English - and of Interglossa and Glosa - a person develops a better 'feel'
for the language and a better understanduing of the essence of the words.
    I guess that Hogben did assume that he was speaking to an educated
audience, which was aware of the source roots of the technology lexicon.
    However, Ron Clark used to suggest that learning Glosa was an excellent
introduction to the English language, often introducing to learners, for
the first time, the roots inherent in English.

    I believe that learning about the etymology of language gives us a much
better understanding of the nature of language.  Had George W. Bush taken
time off to understand the source of the words he uses, he would not now be
voicing the tremendous gaffs he is making on National, US television, such
as saying "preverse" instead of "perverse", or in describing hidden
messages as "subliminable."

Oh, I disagree ... Nothing is new under the sun.
America is the modern Rome, and English phrasal verbs
are directly parallel with Latin, but non-international.

Indeed, but more like multi-sided dice ... recede recess,
procede process, precede precess, concede (= concess), accede access,
(ab-cede?) abcess, (in-cede?) incess(ant) ... and so on!
This is the Glosa core vocabulary, and the core international vocab.

Taking words in their proper forms, they are 100% regular and easy.
The CEDE/CESA words point the way to re-organizing the Glosa-8000
into a few hundred core root-concepts that generate word families.
This solves the problem of having too many unrelated words,
without throwing-out, e-ject-ing, or a-bol-ishing any.

Agreed, an IAL must *not* be simple as in "makeshift pidgin jargon",
but *must* be simple as in "direct and powerful but easy to learn".
These are not contradictory in a well-designed IAL.
The heart of an IAL is not a vocab list, which must evolve,
but rather its principles, which need to remain consistent.
Any IAL must use the international word roots and affixes.
If we keep returning to this base concept, we cannot go wrong.

Right, those small non-international words must be excluded,
whereas BOV- and VAC- are international and form many useful
derivatives. It is not so easy to do this properly, though ...
"vaccinate, vaccine" comes originally from "vacca = cow",
but "bovine = cow" is now used internationally for the animal.

Thanks, for dating your messages so far in the past
they sort to the bottom for quick unread deletion.
Please continue that way. BTW, how many of the
random word stems of the IED have you learned?
Do you still mix everything with your native
language so that it all comes out the same?

Sorry, but I won't hear your replies.
You harassed me on every public mailing list,
and managed to kill Jeffrey's last month.
I'm not abandoning this list, though.
Keep reading my posts and learn something,
you might even get tenure, somewhere ... despite
your deep mental problems and character defect.

And please, resume your medicine; it's that
manic-depressive cycle, you're acting-up again.

    I must demur here.  There are those who assert that there is a
deep structure, or some such thing, to grammar.  I will not address
that point, as I think it is unnecessary here.  I fear that what Robin
is referring to here as "the innate language sense of the the utterers"
is no more than native language conditioning, and that varies all over
the map all over the world.  We must be very, very, very, very, very
careful not to confuse what seems "natural" to us, due to our own
language conditioning, with what seems "natural" to everybody.  That is
why I think that, didactically, a language with almost no grammatical
morphology such as Glosa needs to have its syntactic structures
effectively specified, if not formally then by a comprehensive set of
not only paradigmatic sentences but also paradigmatic connected texts.

    But what is the nature of this "powerful derivational system" that
you claim an IAL needs?  What about Tok Pisin?  Grass belong head =
hair.  Grass belong face = beard.  Is this a powerful enough
derivational system, or does it count only if it is morphological with
affixes and mutating roots, as is so with many, many latinate word

    Latin itself did not have nearly the size of vocabulary that
English does.  (Few languages did/do.)  Does that mean that Latin
was/is (it's still alive) not a "real adult language"?  I agree 
with the sentence you quoted.

Tok Pisin works just fine, and I posted a good URL about that.
If there were a similar system in Glosa (head-last compounding),
then it would be more like a pidgin-creole and very interesting
as a global IAL. I once thought that was the intent, but now
it seems less likely ... Wendy may/should clarify that;
one could well argue that Marcel's G-5000 supports it.
Still the latinate prefixes would remain, and they do fit
the TP pattern (but reverse of English verb+adverb) nicely.
Or possibly Glosa would go the suffixation route. I dunno.

They say that Latin and Greek derivational systems could easily
handle any challenge one could present to them; even tele-vision ...
English incorporates many different roots for similar concepts,
where L & G used affixes to "nuance" the relatively few roots.
English turned out more "regular" but L & G more "systematic",
(at least in some senses, as we are probably all aware by now).
Our international language must combine their strengths,
but carefully avoid their weaknesses.

I am looking at the verbs first, because there is a large set
of very useful and mnemonically related international roots,
LECT etc, easily combinable with the prepositions CO- etc.
>From verbs one derives agents, results, states, etc.
So one word expands into 100 ... With just a few of those,
we can generate a huge at-sight-recognizable vocab in hours.
Those words are all to be found hiding within the Glosa vocab.
They are the true core learner vocab.

Haaahhhh !!!
Youre welcome Catty.
No, I'm not on any meds, and not on
any bi-polar cycles. Just annoyed by
your constant references to how much
better Occidental is... "Oh, Occi is just
sooooo much better" "Ohhhh I can't
believe Glosa's derivational system,
Ohhhhh me, ohh my"

Give me a pregnant break pal!

Look, Glosa works, Glosa is not
perfect. Neither are you, nor am I
nor are the authors of Glosa, nor
your beloved Occi idols, nor any
human being on this planet. That
you constantly highlight the glories
of Occidental on this list is quite
annoying, specially since Interlingua
is by far more developped and better
thought out than Occidental. Glosa
on the other hand does not have the
same scope nor function as Interlingua.
It is a language for global communication.
Something Interlingua does not nor has
ever claimed to be. Interlingua is an at-sight
recognizable system for use among people
who are acquainted with the source languages,
or who are interested in learning a simple
system that can help bridge them over to
understanding the base languages used
to derive Interlingua.

Glosa on the other hand is a means of
communication by which simple roots
have been decided upon to serve as
building blocks in creating a simple
yet workable language whereby people
of different langauges can communicate.
Glosa uses Greek and Latin roots to form
its building blocks. But more than this
it uses simple patterns of forming sentences
and avoids complicated derivational systems
and stays away from the schematic feel of
IALs like Esperanto and Ido.

Occidental is just a lesser Interlingua as
far as I'm concerned, and needs a lot more
tweaking than Glosa.

Now go put that in your peace pipe or
wherever else you wish, and please note
the correct date has been well attended to
on your account... May it do wonders
for your self-esteem to be so sharp eyed.

Since,
Jay B.

Well, you keep going wrong time and again,
Catty. What's wrong with pidgins and jargon.
Lingua Franca of the Levant lived for centuries
and was used by many to communicate across
barriers. Now what's more important to have
traders understand one another or to have some
logically derived or contrived grammar. ???

No, no y no! There's nothing wrong with Glosa
having simple word formations. There's nothing
wrong with simple languages. Koine Greek was
more important to the daily lives of people 2000
years ago than Philosophical Greek ever was. 
Hebrew was a shepherds language, or so it has
been called, and yet God Himself thought it good
to have the first books of the Bible written in it.
Go figure, eh? Maybe you know better... Hah!

All this tweaking and perfectionist hi-falootin 
is just a lot of tootin. Akin to Government speak.
In my opinion. Keep it simple and keep it sweet...
you know how the rest goes...

Since,
Jay B.

I have finally looked at Marcel's list of "missing" words,
present in the English common-word lists and not in Glosa,
but I disagree that they are really missing:

absence    ... ABSENTIA
acceptable ... ACEPTABILI
accordance ... AKORDANTIA
accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

Should all the derivatives be listed in the dictionary?
Peano and De Wahl and Jesperson all used a compressed
list format, indicating derivatives sorta like:

A-CEPT -a, -ant(e), --ia, -abili

I think they should be written out more fully,
but listed together in proper word-families,
which makes study 1000 times easier:

-CEPT-
	acept-, koncept-, recept- ...
	-ceptabili -ception -ceptive -ceptentie

-LECT-
	...
	...

-MAN-
	...
	...

Or maybe each prefix-ed form requires a separate line,
because the meanings are not entirely apparent;
and maybe the suffixed forms too:

-CEPT-
koncept-
recept-
...
-ceptabili
-ception
...

But we need cannot list all the combined forms separately,
there are far too many: reception, acceptable, ... ad inf.
And it seems to me that most if not all international words
are inherently part of Glosa, whether listed anywhere or not.
Of course it's good evidence if the root is attested somewhere ...

Thank you Charles for reading the list
(www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm ).  Sorry, the list is messy,
because I was too lazy to write comments to every word.  The list
shows important English words that are not in (my suggestion of a)
"Core"-dictionary.  I found it necessary to protocol them.


 > but I disagree that they are really missing: ...

Me too.


 > absence    ... ABSENTIA

"ABSENTIA" does not satisfy me, when we take "AB" for "absent".
That would mean, that the English words (natural language)
absent/absence are closer together than the Glosa words ab/absentia.
I think, it was Paul who wrote: English is the world language to beat.
(Perhaps "AB-TEM", "AB-LO", "AB-STATUS" or courageous "U AB"?)


 > acceptable ... ACEPTABILI
 > accordance ... AKORDANTIA

"CEPTI" is Glosa1000, prefered for "accept".  So "CEPTI-ABILI".  Maybe
"CEPTI" is enough?
Maybe "AKORDA"/"U AKORDA" is enough?  Or "HARMONI"?


 > accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

"accurate" is given in the Internet Dictionary with "exakti 1++".
"accuracy" is missing.  "EXAKTI MODE" is a good idea.  That is what I
thought of.  In this way we could complete the list.


All word creations or modifications I made are marked with "*" and
are explained in www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz .  Mainly I
tried to avoid inconsistencies.
Your "ABSENTIA", "ACEPTABILI" and "AKORDANTIA" are not in the Glosa
Internet Dictionary yet.
I do not think that it is Glosa what you are doing there, it is more
Ido or Volapük.  I understood it like this:

- Glosa does not prefix/affix/suffixfixfix (although I confess, that
  you showed succesfully, that some Glosa-6000s look so).  Perhaps a
  weak point.

- But: Glosa can build new words with the existing words, connecting
  them with hyphens.  That is powerful.

Posi Glosperido/Occideglossa (tu verba) es u fu lingua.  Sed na ne

AB is simply the prefix known in all IE languages, "away from",
officially included in Glosa's list of prefixes; ABS is a variant spelling
used in cases like this, where the compound is really AB-ES (essence, ES, to be)
plus -NT (Latin present participle) plus -IA (abstract noun suffix).
English absent/absence are the same word with different part-of-speech.
It is extremely international, therefore indispensible, unfortunately
messy too. We could use "reanalysis = popular etymology" to cheat:
pretend it is AB-SENT = "be or feel sent away from" or something.

> I think, it was Paul who wrote: English is the world language to beat.

English is not a world language in any sense. It is like French 150 years
ago. And the same thing prevents it being an IAL: lousy pronunciation,
despite good spelling of the international words. People who favor
phonetic spelling of English are killing it as an IAL ... fortunately!

> (Perhaps "AB-TEM", "AB-LO", "AB-STATUS" or courageous "U AB"?)

It's just no good to ignore the international vocabulary.
ABSENT/ABSENCE is PRESENT in every European language.
I have zero interest in any so-called IAL that is effectively apriori.

> "CEPTI" is Glosa1000, prefered for "accept".  So "CEPTI-ABILI".  Maybe
> "CEPTI" is enough?

Not really ... looks like "septic" to me. It is better to leave
the words long enough to be easily recognizeable. What's the hurry
nowadays? People need to slow down and enjoy all the syllables ...

> Maybe "AKORDA"/"U AKORDA" is enough?  Or "HARMONI"?

Both "accept/recept/decept/..." and "accord/discord/record/..."
word families are certainly needed.

>  > accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

> "accuracy" is missing.

Not a bit: see KURA, the most overused Glosa root of all.
It compounds with AD to make AD-KURA = AKURA.

> Your "ABSENTIA", "ACEPTABILI" and "AKORDANTIA" are not in the Glosa
> Internet Dictionary yet.

They are inherent in Glosa, according to the sources.
You can't eliminate the prefixed words, and shouldn't want to.
Furthermore, ABILI is given in a hundres places as a suffix.
I have shown that -IA and -IO and others are also suffixes.

> I do not think that it is Glosa what you are doing there, it is more
> Ido or Volapük.

No. Please do not accuse me of making a new language project.
That is the filth from lunatic Jay Bowks, who has entered every
IAL discussion group only to sow discord and promote his favorite,
which is certainly not Glosa. I do not want any new IALs.
The only IALs worth considering are those based on the Greco-Latin
international vocabulary, which all can freely mix as dialects.
Within the territories of Ido/Novial, Occidental, and Glosa
can be found all that is necessary for the true IAL.

I have revised my view of Glosa trying to match that of the authors.
It is not a pidgin at all. It is a naive relex of English using
a pocket Italian-English dictionary. Thus it inherited all the
prefixes and suffixes of Greco-Latin. Not my fault!

> - But: Glosa can build new words with the existing words, connecting
>   them with hyphens.  That is powerful.

Simple word compounding is fun but insufficient;
one needs a system. Look at ABILI and KURA in the
materials we just typed ... When I tried translating
word-for-word from Occidental to Glosa I was amazed;
every word but one was in Glosa directly, though in
the messy ABSENTI form you don't like (but I do).

Now *I* am the Glosa conservative, and *you* are the radical
imposing a new vision of pidgin-vocab that the authors
did not clearly intend. You can't throw out the latinate words
and call it Glosa, you dangerous revolutionary!

Joking aside: As we analyze it, clearly Glosa needs some
new clear definitions and directions from Wendy. Should it
become more like the naturalistic IALs, using roots, prefixes
and suffixes? Or should it go pidgin/creole? It doesn't
make much sense as it is right now, halfway between.
If if remains ill-defined and non-systematic, it can't compete
with other IALs. I would like to see it rejuvenated somehow.

I did not want to "accuse" you.  Sorry.  It is just a thing of 
definition.  You would prefer a language between Occidental (and 
others) and Glosa.  I think, this language does not exist and would be 
a new project.  You say it would be no new language, but only a new 
dialect of the existing ones.  Next mail you will see my new :) 
language project.

Prefixes, suffixes and so on or pidgin/creole? 
Good question.  If Glosa would have suffixes, it would get 
part-of-speech-markers (remember: Interglossa had ones!).  And then 
the complete language would come into danger.  ...?  Perhaps "halfway 
between" is gold? 

I just wanted to have a better dictionary, because it was obvious, 
that the previous Internet Dictionary was far apart from the authors's 
publications (except one, namely the book "Glosa 6000"). 

Now I would say, it was quite successful, the dictionary is useful, 
but one problem (vocabulary) cannot be solved without the others 
(e.g.: Prefix/suffix/syllables, system or mess?//  Part-of-speech, yes 
or no?// A lot of important English words are between just an -ing 
form and own "concept", but Glosa has no present participle to imitate 
them.//  And do not forget the ending vowels.).

From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>
Date: Thu, 21 Sep 2000 20:23:05 +0200

For Charles, a "cheap" way to Occideglossa: 

* Occidental uses: -ion, -or, -ori, -iv, -ura, -t. 
* -ion and -ura are close together, I think, not both are necessary. 

* Glosa has the ge- for -t and -pe for -or already.  
* Glosa takes the naked word for -ion, -ori, -iv, -ura.  
* It can form nouns with u/plu and with -ra.  
* -ion is in many Glosa words as -io like petitio, tensio already, 
    but without a meaning! 
* Glosa would allow a combination with -status for -ion. 

Using the existing ge-, -pe, -status, only five new items would 
satisfy you: 
-aktion (a REAL noun from "akti"), -resultat, -(t)ori, -(t)if, and 
maybe -(e)nt for a present participle. 

Put these five into the Core-dictionary, with the remark that they are 
not original and with the advice possibly not to use them, and let the 
language users do what they want. 

I wonder, whether it would help, damage or destroy Glosa.

To "international vocabulary": you charged Jay, 00-09-17:

When we allow all Romanic and Greek words, then a Spaniard speaks 
Spanish and claims to speek Glosa, also the Italian, the Brazilian, 
the French and the Greek.  And all are right!  And I ---- understand 
none of them. 

I remember when I started Latin at school.  The teacher said, nearly 
all Latin words have cognated ones in German.  The first lesson showed 
words like "rosa - Rose (rose)" and "insula - Insel (island)".  It 
seemed, that vocabulary learning would not become a problem.  I 
remember very exactly that later it was not so easy at all!  
Learning only 10 words per day needs discipline, even if the words are 
international.  

==> A vocabulary restriction is necessary.

?  Is Glosa vocabulary strictly limited or is Glosa just "take every
?  Latin/Greek/scientific word you know and use it without grammar"?

?  Have all words to be learned or can some of them be built up by the
?  speaker using a regular system?

I would say: The Glosa authors tried all.  They were not interested so
much in a word building system.  They made "Generic Terms", and that
was it.  That may be too few, but it is better than its final
consequence, a "so-called IAL that is effectively apriori" (I think
best/worst example is Volapük).  I mean "too few" not because of
unsatisfying expressivity of the language, but because of
inconsistencies in the dictionary resulting from a missing system.

They tried a restricted vocabulary (Glosa 1000) and allowed every
other Latin/Greek/scientific (and really Italian!) word simultanously
as "Mega Glosa".

I think their way is possible, but only
- {restricted vocabulary:} if the Core-dictionary has a very high
  quality (well chosen words, only few synonyms, few inconsistencies)
  and is carefully maintained (regularly updated in internet and
  print), but nevertheless stable (not changing too often),
- {Mega vocabulary:} if no language group is dominating,
- {Mega vocabulary:} if the quantity of communication in Glosa is so
  high that a vocabulary is formed automatically by its users.

Well, hmm.

>  > No. Please do not accuse me of making a new language project.

NO!!!!!, not a new language! We have enough right now.
Again: use existing IALs, but do not remain chained to them.

> Prefixes, suffixes and so on or pidgin/creole?

I would prefer P/C but recently it seems incontestable
that the authors imported all the prefixes and many suffixes.
European languages do creolize nicely, and we have no other
example of an IAL of this type. (Lingua Franca Nova has
almost nothing in common with the real LF.)

> If Glosa would have suffixes, it would get

No, p.o.s. markers are superfluous, and that is why linguists
laugh at Esperanto and Ido. Real languages have a set of affixes
that inherently define p.o.s., e.g. in "electr-ic, terrif-ic"
the -IC is *an* adjectival suffix, not the *only* one.

But if Glosa were to eliminate all euro-suffixes, their
functions would be transferred to prefixed compounds.
De Wahl suggested that will eventually happen in eurolangs.
So, why not a Glosa that accelerates this development?

> And then the complete language would come into danger.  ...?
> Perhaps "halfway between" is gold?

Try using it! If it remains halfway, and is used, something good
might happen. But I doubt it. Currently, I can't stop amid each
sentence to convert a natural -IC suffix to a compound.

> Now I would say, it was quite successful, the dictionary is useful,

Yes, the first real accomplishment I've seen here. Kudos!

Because they used the non-international words. They are therefore wrong.

> international.  

There is no time for adults to learn a second language
that way. The words must be known to them within their
native language. And they are! In one weekend you teach
how to recognize the international words they already know.
Vocabulary is then a solved problem.

> ==> A vocabulary restriction is necessary.

But impossible. Tomorrow a new international word is born.
Everybody uses it except adherents of some religious IAL.

An IAL is *not* a language for children, and should not be
taught in schools; only the great cultural languages should be.
An IAL is for *adults*, who already have well-learned their native lang.
It would be a disaster, a culture-cide, a fanatical vandalism,
to attempt to replace our natural languages with any IAL.

> I would say: The Glosa authors tried all.

Yes, and improved Interglossa greatly, with interesting results.
It just isn't ready as an IAL, without an additional huge input
from the user's imagination. It needs more work, and could be fixed
in several different ways. The remaining author must give the direction.

> inconsistencies in the dictionary resulting from a missing system.

No dictionary can hold all the words of any language,
there must be a system. Every natural lang has such a system,
but lacks sufficient regularity to be easily learned.

Oh. Well, something more has to be done now, because it's a mess.

I only feel justified in using what is *already* present in Glosa.
The Euro-Glossa exists in those crypto-suffixes. For a more interesting
Creolo-Glosa: All the cryptosuffixes are ejected, along with the ugly
apriori -po -bo set. Only word-compounding is allowed:

Occ:    Crypto:      Creolo:      English:
====    ========     =======      ===========================
-ion    -tio         -akti        deverbal abstract noun, action
-or     -ero, -ra?   -homi, -uti  deverbal agentive noun
-ori    -ori         sista-?      deverbal adj., consistent with
-iv     -i, -ivi     pote-        deverbal adj., able/likely to
-ura    -ura, -ur-   -resulta?    deverbal concrete noun, result
-t      -t-, -d-?    fini-        participle, past/passive
-nt     -nt-, -nd-?  dura-        participle, present/active

This is good legal effective official Glosa, actually,
both the Crypto and Creolo columns are in the dictionary.
Only a radical reform-purge-inquisition can remove them!

I know I could use Crypto, because I did already in my experiment
several days ago. Crypto looks like all the other interlingues
and mixes well, i.e. is comprehensible without study. Only the
agentive nouns are a problem, and could be fixed somehow.
But the world has no need for Crypto-Glosa when better IALs exist.

Creolo is the truer spirit of Interglossa/Glosa, IMO.
And I know it would work, because other P/C langs do.
Over time the 3-syllabic compounders would be simplified,
as happened rapidly with the Chinook Jargon. My ideal for
Glosa would be all bi-syllabic roots and no affixes,
all roots compoundable in a systematic and productive way.
Until last month I thought the authors intended such, and
simply had not finished cleaning up the mess. I wish they
(Wendy) would direct us and others to perfect Creolo-Glosa.

Wendy and Ron prefered "xanto" without any doubt.  And so it is 
prefered in the Internet Dictionary now (Bill prefered "flavo" 
before.).  Other words are more tricky because they are both in 
Glosa-1000 and have compounds there (e.g. bio/vive). 

G6000-English says for "luteo" "yellow, brownish" ("brownish" is 
missing in the Internet Dictionary.  I have to put it in for the next 
update!) and for "helvo" "pale yellow".  My Latin dictionary gives for 
"flaveo" gold-yellow.  "safro" is from saffron.  Saffron is very 
expensive, unfortunately I have none in the kitchen, but I remember, 
it was a bit more red-yellow. 

For "xanto" Central-Glosa gives as cognated international word 
"xanto-phyll" and as etymological note: 
  "XANTO-PHYLL G yellow-leaf.  Xantophyll is a yellow pigment in green 
  leaves usually concesled by the intense CHLOROPHYLL. It becomes 
  evident in autumn." 
(Ci, in Hamburg, tu nu pote vide multi xanto folia.  Po frigi 
termo-tem mi pre-nu habe sperma-tem.) 


 > "x" eqa "ks" so "xanto" posi esce "kasanto". 

I like the X, because it is striking by listening and reading because 
it is so rare.  A colour and you hear only ks --> you know instantly 
it is yellow.  It sounds Greek and I like Greek. 

Please no "kasanto".  If you do not like "x", you can speak "s".  
(Cf. book "Glosa 6000", p. 17:) 
  "One or two Greek words start off with awkward-looking pairs of 
  consonants as in psychology.  It is preferable to pronounce the p, 
  but not essential, and can be at individual discretion. "

*   Friends,
    Nice to hear Jay's comments.  Yes, I'd say the Glosa authors were
trying to have it both ways: they made Glosa creole-like with a simply
derived vocabulary, and then they planned for it to be easy to learn with
virtually no morphological grammar.
    The 'Head Final' SVO sentence structure seems to be working quite well,
with the only deficiency worrying me being the lack of further "semantic",
hyphenated suffixes.  This refers to the "generic terms". Allowing only
eigteen two-letter, abbreviated semantic suffixes does seem too few for
civilised conversation; Paul Bartlett mentioned this some time ago,
forshadowing the possible introduction of more , and probably longer,
semantic affixes.  And these have sneaked into Glosa with
~-abili~, ~-ismo~, ~logi~, etc.  However, Paul dislikes the hyphen, because
it has no sound attached, and cannot be pronounced: my belief is that the
hyphen separates discrete words and word abbrevitions, and  assists the
reader etymologically and the computer, symbolically .. while preventing
the pronunciations of the elements of a compound from interfering with
one-another.

   We probably need some more "generic terms."

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*   So, I appreciate Jay's giving me this opportunity to re-inforce a
difference between Glosa and some of the other Interlanguages.

    Glosa was perceived of as a whole language, in itself.  The idea being
that, as well as having the qualities listed, in the paragraph above, it
was presented to be a "comprehensive" language, with a life of its own.
    During the time that I was 'retelling', not 'translating', _The Three
Bears_, I got a shock when I reached the stage that, instead of stumbling
to make Glosa work, I found that the language, itself, was carrying me
along.  On reflection, I realised that I was no longer breathing life into
Glosa, but, instead, it was running ahead of me and inspiring my thoughts.
 
    I had expected to take much longer, to reach such a stage, with a
language that was being shaped by being hewn out of the 'communication
stream' rather than by being absorbed 'through immersion.'   It was at this
stage that I discovered Glosa really had a life of its own.

    On further reflection, I have found that my thinking on, and usage of,
English has changed - as a result of my discoveries about language through
thinking about Glosa.  Such prognostications have led me to make
suggestions that, to develop fluency, one should aim at "thinking in
Glosa," and that Glosa, like the 'natural' languages, is congruent with
"the language of thought."

    And one factor, of the Glosalist experience, that has worried me as a
language researcher, is the small number of subscribers, who have actually
used Glosa to produce writing of over one paragraph, in length.  I greatly
enjoyed reading Bill Patterson's translation of "The Wolf," and was very
pleased that others were drawn into working on this translation.  Also, I
am glad to see, of late, a number of e-mail contributions in Glosa.  It
does however, definitely help me - in my research - to compare the Glosa
with an appended English-language 'translation.'

    Which reminds me to ask: how many Glosalist-pe are not venturing to
write in Glosa for fear of making 'errors'; and, how many contributors
would not like 'corrections' to their use of Glosa published on the List?
    This is a tricky point, with Ron gone, and Wendy currently not on the
Net, I offer suggestions for others who are learning to use Glosa.  So I
would make some suggestions and ask some questions.  Subscribers might
respond to the following statements on the Glosalist or directly to me:-
Yes . No. ?
 ___|___|___  1. I think in Glosa.
 ___|___|___  2. Irregularities in the vocabulary prevent me from writing

   Friends, This is the first time I have asked for direct feedback from
you: perhaps it is well overdue; however, with the anonymity of the
Internet, some might feel that such questioning is an invasion of 
privacy.  By way of explanation, I come from an age before the word
"privacy" was generally current in the language; also, in the dim distant
past, when I joined the race, calling a "spade a spade" was a sign of
integrity.  Attempting to be 'modern,' I do not wish to force anyone to do
anything they do not want to do, nor do I wish to invade anyone's privacy;
however, in seeking the truth upon which science is supposed to be based,  
I would encourage all Glosalist-pe to send in a response, either privately,
or publicly.

Gracia,

New address for location of the glosalist archives:

http://members.nbci.com/ailanto/glosa/index.htm

The old address still works, but I don't know for how long. Their
Website FAQ doesn't give a straight answer on questions like this;
it just says that "it would be beneficial" to change your links.

Xoom bought NBCI or NBCI bought Xoom or they merged or something,
but apparently they didn't bother to tell their users! My first hint
of trouble was when I tried to ftp a new page to the site yesterday;
couldn't connect to the old ftp address. Tried a few times over the
course of the day and then gave up. Tried again today, still couldn't
connect. So I went to their homepage to see if they were having any
problems, and ended up at NBCI instead, and then learned the story.
The Xoom site has become NBCI, my xoommail.com address has become an
email.com address (but my old messages and address book weren't copied
over), and the name of the ftp site changed!

Note: This is undoubtedly true of *all* Xoom addresses. You may want
to check your bookmarks and websites and address books, using
http://members.nbci.com instead of http://members.xoom.com everywhere.
The old addresses still work, but I don't know for how much longer.
And email addresses like somebody{at}xoommail{dot}com are now somebody{at}email{dot}com
(though if they were the same as existing @email.com addresses (if there
were any), I guess they might have changed completely).

There either are affixes or not; examination of the
vocab proves that there are both prefixes and suffixes.
Beginners only avoid them for a while, not for long,
because they need to make certain distinctions:
credible vs. credulous, believed vs. believing,
believe vs. belief, believer vs. politician, etc.

This can be accomplished either by compounds or suffixes,
but they must be productive, i.e. usable spontaneously
rather than by consulting a dictionary. This requires a
real system, which is not clearly visible to me in Glosa.
"Glosa has no grammar" is not sounding so great anymore.
It looks to me like the authors just haven't finished it.

I don't know whether to use crypto-suffixes or head-last
compounding, and I doubt they could ever mesh well;
English does not use compounding for such things:
-able, -ive, -ed, -ing, -ion, -er, -ee, etc.
Glosa should add similar true suffixes rather than the
rather silly artificial -bo -po generics, or else state
clearly what compounds to use (pote-kredi, du-kredi, etc??).
Until then I don't expect to see people writing much in it.

There are enough roots and crypto-suffixes, but if I use them

*   Nick, please spell out for me what is meant by this, with a small
number of examples.

    Are you talking about the tendency to analyse the lexical components of
original Greek and latin roots?  Personally, I find the etymological
approach handy - to help me understand the 'flavour' of the original
source-words.  However, I do tend to think that the final forms of the
words in the derivative national languages have great linguistic value, and
that such syntheses should not be ^cracked open^ to retrieve the small
lexical seeds within .. for the purpose of further sythetic recombination.
    This does not cut across the idea of 'abbreviation', by which the
simplest functional form of a word is derived, often for the purpose of use
in compound formation. 
EG.  KINE  -->  KI ...--> KI-AB

Robin, that is exactly my point! You've illustrated it quite
well. I agree that there comes a thresh-hold to be crossed
at some point in a language learners experience when the
language is no mere translation or relexing of the thought
but a true expression of thought. I agree to some extent with
the idea of Sapir-Whorf that language can influence thought,
but I would not agree to the extreme they bring their conclusions,
so is my opinion, but I do believe that when thought is purely
expressed in a language, this fluent expression, is a great
step in a learners advancement in the target language. Some
people never reach that stage. In the case of some interlinguists
perennial tweaking only leads to much talk and experimentation
but they seem to never make the step to fluent expression of
thoughts. The continual tweaking has its fault in that the
changes prevent the full apprehension of patterns needed to
express thoughts fluently.

Since,
Jay B.

P.S. I liked your questionnaire and I'd be interested in it.
Egroups.com offers a poll feature in its system... Could
Glosa-l be archived through Egroups.com like Auxlang is already?

Subject: [glosalist] Jay Bowks's trick answers
From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Wed, 27 Sep 2000 13:58:21 -0700

For those who have not observed Jay's tricks
in the other IAL mailing lists, I translate:

1. Jay believes only in Gode's Interlingua
and the Jehovah's Witnesses cult. His ethical
(and common) sense remains undeveloped.

2. Jay is here only to destroy Glosa.
He resists any attempt to improve it, because
it might become competition to his beloved Ila.

3. He will destroy discussion by any means,
as shown on AUXLANG and the Occidental/Interlingue
lists, and even on Jeffrey's list which explicitly
outlawed his tactics (Jay was banned there once;
nobody dares to post there now, since Jay returned).

4. Jay seems to think that I am such a "threat"
that he follows me to every open email list,
attempting to harass and annoy until I lose interest.
He is a flamer/troll; no list can long withstand
his provocations. I now request the list-owner
to ban or moderate his postings.

5. I tire of replying to others who have been misled
by his false attributions. Yet another example:

[Jay proposes:]

> A set
> of standards in word formation would definitely improve
> the language. For example any word ending in English
> "-tion" could be used as "-cio" in Glosa.

I do not subscribe to Jay's proposal.
Then, his mierda:

> But this would be a definite change of the language as
> it is, perhaps too great to call it Glosa anymore, more
> like Kosmo-Glosa and have Catty feeling all warm and
> fuzzy inside.

Why is it necessary for Jay to play such childish tricks?
Only I can speak for myself. Please, don't be misled by Jay's
continued personal attacks. Is that the sort of argument
that grown adults want to see on this list?

> >14 I wish some folks would just develop their own auxlang
> >and stop trying to change Glosa. (my addition)

All languages adapt or die. All people do likewise.
A dead Glosa would certainly fit Jay's plans for Ila.
But many people continue to hope that Hogben's original
idea of an analytic non-affix-bound IAL, creole-like,
can offer to the whole world an easier alternative
to the naturalistic European-based IALs such as Ila.
Among those, I much prefer Occidental; really, Glosa has
no chance of beating Occ at its own game ... Glosa's only
hope for success is in a creolistic reform direction.

    I will stay out of the pissing match.  However, it does seem
curious to me that more than one individual who seem to have made
choices for one or another naturalistic Euro-auxlang are even here at
all.  I do know of one person who decided that Glosa was not for him
and unsubscribed.  Although I have some preferences, I have not yet
really come down on the side of any one auxlang.  If I do and it is not
Glosa, or if I conclude that Glosa has no realistic prospects, then I,
too, would unsubscribe.

There is no such thing. You have witnessed Jay's attacks
in several elists, and now you want to equate the victim
with the perpetrator?? By calling it such, you just joined.
Turn every IAL elist into a sewer, go ahead ...

I see Glosa as the nearest thing to a creole IAL, but it needs
reform to become usable. Nobody is using it as-is, that's the proof.
If you want to play love-it-or-leave-it, that's your choice.
And, although dirty-politics always seem the dominant factor,
the technical quality of the IAL really does make a difference,
as proven by Volapuk's demise.

QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERS FOR JAY BOWKS

> 1. I think in Glosa.
Once I get going on a translation exercise or
start writing my notes to this list in Glosa.
I find it easier to keep my word-list open just
in case memory fails me though.

> 2. Irregularities in the vocabulary prevent me from writing in Glosa.
No, irregularities are part of all languages.

> 3. A lack of clear-cut guidelines on syntax prevent me from writing in Glosa.
No but... The mechanics of Glosa afford a sample syntax
formula that one can imitate. But a grammar
book that examines these would be helpful for
some.

> 4. I do write in Glosa and am confident that I am using standardised sentence
form.
Yes. As long as I stick to the wordlists and the
mechanics I know it's good enough for use.

> 5. I do write in Glosa, but am in a state of subjective uncertainty over my
usage.
Not uncertain. I write Glosa when I feel up to
it and I have my wordlists and sample sentences
handy for reference.

> 6. As far as I know, my Glosa usage is correct, but I could be in error on
some points.
Yes, I might make errors, that's why I depend
on the wordlists and samples.

> 7. Sometimes when attempting to use Glosa, I find that there
> are some ideas I feel unable to express in Glosa.
Yes, at times, then I try re-expressing the thought
in other words. This is something that happens to me
in several languages. It is a skill to master, as I
see it. "Circumlocution" talking about the object using
other words which are familiar to you.

> 8. A better dictionary is needed before I can feel happy in attempting to use
Glosa.
Maybe. A better dictionary would help spread Glosa's
use... Something like a "Teach Yourself: Glosa" book
with a glossary included.

> 9. An instruction manual is needed before I can feel happy
> in attempting to use Glosa.
No, one can start with what is found right now on the
net. But a manual like I mention above would definitely
help spread Glosa to new speakers all over.

> 10. A basic grammar book will improve my use of Glosa
Yes, a grammar primer with exercises would definitely
give me some practice of the language so this would help.

> 11. A basic grammar book is needed before I can feel
> happy in attempting to use Glosa.
Not really. I'm happy right now. But I'd be delighted to
purchase a manual like the one I mention above.
                   
> 12. I can understand the structure of the language through
> observation of printed Glosa texts.
Yes the Glosa mechanics samples offer an easily followed
set of patterns one can imitate.

> 13. There are aspects of the language I seek further information on:
Yes and No. On one hand the limited set of words in Glosa
serve as a means easy access to the language. The fact that
it has a limited vocabulary also hinders progress. A set
of standards in word formation would definitely improve
the language. For example any word ending in English
"-tion" could be used as "-cio" in Glosa. This would
of course change the language greatly and through the
idea of word economy out the window. But it would make
Glosa very approachable by Westerners who share this
international standardised set of Latin terms. Going
further with this development one could drop the ending
and have derived the root of the verb. If, for example...
communication = "komunikacio" ergo "komunika";
transportation = "transportacio" ergo "transporta".
But this would be a definite change of the language as
it is, perhaps too great to call it Glosa anymore, more
like Kosmo-Glosa and have Catty feeling all warm and
fuzzy inside. 

>14 I wish some folks would just develop their own auxlang
>and stop trying to change Glosa. (my addition)
Definitely! The fact that Glosa is good enough to use in
actuall exchanges of messages by students of it is reason
enough to consider it worthy of acceptance as it is.
That some folks wish to keep tweaking it goes against
the development of Glosa so far. It was a project with
a copyright by two individuals, it was developed and used
and it is good enough to use. Those that wish to can make
their own language project as they desire it and call it
something else.

Date: Fri, 29 Sep 2000 15:05:04 EDT

Here is a sentence in English with some analysis (head of phrase in caps) :-

[subject] the slightLy fat MAN with the long (and) black hair /  [verb] 
quickly GAVE / [object] the blue BIRD / [INDIRECT OBJECT] to the thankful 
WOMAN.

Reduce words to stems, present tense stems, simplify ****ful

the slight.fat ......... did quick GIVE....... ........ the 
full-of-thank......... 

Look up words in dictionary

u pusi.obesi ANDRO ko u longi e melani triko / pa tako DONA / u kiano AVI / a 
u ple-de-gratia GINA.

Note - adverb.adjective "little fat" not "little man" and "fat man", (pusi e 
obesi) like "longi e melani"

Try replacing the English words in the example above and translating into 
Glosa. You must have a subject and a verb but the object and indirect object 
can be left out. They need not be noun phrases.

Be brave! Show us your results!

This nightmare is not a joke, unfortunately it is Glosa truth.  
I asked Wendy Ashby about final vowels.  Yesterday I got a response 
letter from her that says it is about the way above. 

So Glosa is nothing else but English with Italian pronounciation and 
the words with Germanic origin avoided.  Sorry, I cannot see much use 
of such a system.  I am very disappointed.  Good night, Glosa.  

Of course, I was very glad to get a response from Wendy in spite of 
her personal problems and sadness. 
There is a little hope that Wendy will return to Glosa work later, 
though it cannot be recognized that it will go in a desirable 
direction then. 
Lights in the dark are Robin's work, his grammar, seminar #1 and 2.  
They could be cooked together with parts of Hogben's 
"Interglossa"-book and example sentences of "18 Steps to Fluency in 
Euro-Glosa" to a comprehensive and unambiguous introduction manual.  
And our Internet Dictionary, - as a starting base for a vocabulary 
reform.  But all this is far away.

Well, final vowels were not given much importance by either
Ron or Wendy, according to the other message you posted.
So, it is as we surmised, and they are very easily repaired:
the rule is that they don't matter (are in "free variation")
in most cases, therefore need not be memorized.

We need to account for the few problem cases where they conflict,
that's all. But if we (thee? not me) happen to fix the finals
in an etymologically improved fashion, that can't hurt anyone's
feelings, and it can improve Glosa greatly and cheaply. Example:

15      animala      animal
234     animali      animal, beast
5       animaliza    brutalize

OK, I see Latin "animalis" as an adjectival form,
so -i is very plausible. If the Glosa word is to function
as verb/noun/adjective, maybe -i is the only good choice.

12345   ANIMALI      animal, beast, brute, brutal, brutalize

We could have fun going through the whole vocabulary.
Don't despair, recognizing a problem is the first step
toward solving it. Only denial or apathy fails utterly.

The H is not pronounced in modern Romance languages,

the intended fonetization of Glosa for global use, ...

Your meds wore off? Be careful not to drive while
you're in that state. When have you cultists
scheduled the next end of the world, by the way?
Do you expect Interlingua to catch on before then?
Is there any single open IAL list that you have
not destroyed with your tricks?

I found one you pulled in AUXLANG before I joined:
somebody wanted to do a poll of members, so you
found 20 innocent beginners from outside the list,
pushed them to join and vote for the only IAL they
knew about ... your favorite. You can quit trying to
infiltrate the Occ groups with your email aliases.

I feel that there is a lot of interest in Glosa,
much more than for your simulated Romance language.
Hogben passed on his idea to A&C, who improved it.
Now it appears that soon it will again be passed on,
perhaps to a committee to oversee its evolution and
growth. (Is "evolution" another hot spot for you?)
Glosa will survive and revive and grow. The more you
attack and disrupt, the more you inoculate Glosa
against further infections like yourself. (Oh, are
"vaccinations" also a problem for you cultists?)

Still it seems to me that email lists cannot
long remain open to provocateurs like Jay Bowks.
Some of us are talking off-list about the needed
reforms (another word ...) you won't be part of;
your antics are unacceptable in polite company.

Of course the final vowel problem must be solved: 
Glosa is in competition with other auxlangs.  Every unsolved problem 
  is a disadvantage in this competition. 
Differing final vowels are very problematic for a short hand system 
  and for computer translation. 
They are difficult to learn.  And vocabulary learning is hard work. 
  Ask a language teacher ;) ;) ;) ! 


An example to make clear what I mean (I think normally not necessary): 
To memorize the Latin word "via - way", you learn the root vi-, that 
is similar to the English, and the ending -a, which gives the 
beautiful imagination that via is female.  So you have to learn two 
things, both easy.  
For an auxlang only one would be best. 
But in Glosa you have to learn the root and the final vowel, again two 
things, but the final vowel does not give the imagination of a gender 
nor of anything else. 
A vowel on its own is abstract and difficult to memorize, similar to a 
number. 
A systematical chosen final vowel would help this. 

That is the problem and it is a problem.  Sure, we can and should use 
Glosa without taking final vowels too serious (see Wendy's letter), 
but that is only provisional (I hope).

His persistent sniping personal attacks must be stopped.
They prevent others (who have something positive to say)
from participating in the list. He has killed several
IAL lists in this way. He wants Glosa dead too.

> Libe-dice es fo importa ra.

There are limits to free speech. He is trying to shout-down
anyone who "threatens" his lunatic opinions, i.e. he has
trampled *my* free speech rights, and on several email lists.
It won't stop, even after warnings, even after promises
to stop the personal attacks. He can't control himself.

We aren't going to accomplish anything here as long as
he continues to disrupt everything. Open email lists
are easy prey for flaming trolls such as Jay Bowks.
Better to continue serious discussions off-list.

    I am not feeling well this evening :-( so I won't try to respond in
Glosa.

On Mon, 2 Oct 2000, Marcel Springer wrote (excerpt):

    Yes.  When I first collated the wordlists for the Basic Reference
which I put up on the www (with A&C permission), I noticed the final
vowel problem for real: sometimes basically the same word on more than
one list with more than one final vowel, and sometimes two distinct
words differing only by the final vowel.

    I think the first issue can be solved simply by picking one of a
pair (or in at least one instance, one of a triplet) and using it
exclusively.  I myself am not convinced that it makes much difference
which one is chosen.  Of course, there is the position that one might
use the final vowel at least partially as a part of speech marker, in
the manner of Ido, Esperanto, Master, Suma, and many others.  Again, I
myself am not convinced that this is necessary.  If there is
standardization in the first instance, then I think that the second
issue more or less resolves itself.

    Contrary to an opinion that has been expressed here, I do not think
that all final vowels will degenerate into an undifferentiated mush. 
It is true that native English speakers tend to slur unstressed vowels,
but I do think that we can justifiably expect users of an auxiliary
language to expend at least a little effort if they want to be
understood.  I do not think that a constructed auxlang must always bow
to the habits of native English speakers.

[snipped etc]

Well, I retreat halfway from my mush hypothesis; we can certainly
distinguish MANU from MANE, or something like that. But there are
some terrible pairs like BALI BALE which really cannot be distinguished
in an unstressed syllable by *adult* learners internationally.
Those relatively few pairs can easily be fixed, no big deal.

There's still the significant difficulty of learning them, since
they follow no pattern. Best to use the etymologically correct vowel.
Again, a very easy reform that can't offend anyone but a lunatic.

Part-of-speech vowels are tempting, but I abandoned that Idoesque
idea a while back; they aren't sufficient anyway, because there are
more than 6 parts of speech, and many more derivatives than that.
The problem of word-derivation has no easy solution in Glosa,
other than random word-compounding e.g. "XXXX-ABILI".

Why not just go through with your "more serious reform"
give the thing a name and be done with it instead of
continuing this determined effort to force Glosa into
your idea of what it should be?
What are you so afraid of that you keep posting this

Just learn Glosa like you would any language. Look at

As a "linguist", perhaps you can say where the Romance languages
came from ... perhaps it was an act of special creation?

And why are Greek and Latin, the sources for Glosa's roots,
so similar or haven't you noticed?

Do you think that the Indo-European parent language
can be less than 6000 years old?

Please do the math for us, as any linguist would.

Actually Charles, the fact that I'm a religious
fellow is to your advantage. Otherwise I would
answer you in kind. But I'm not in any meds nor
have ever been :-) As to whether you like or dislike
my religion, all I can say is I've a great deal
more tolerance for others than what you show here.
And for you to attack below the belt... well, Jah
sees and may He do something about it. Your bark
is a lot worse than your byte ;-)
As to the Auxlang poll, there were no rules that
one couldn't invite new members to vote. I broke
no rules. I claimed no secrets, everything was on
the up and up. As to my alias... ilvi@ earthling.net
That's been around for a long time and actually
was my first login name it stands for "I love VI"
as a Unix user you should know what that's about.
But in Occidental{at}egroups{dot}com I'm posting under
my regular ISP, you remember the one you lyingly
tried to get me kicked out of. No secrets here
Catty, actually it seems you're the only one with
secrets, what's all this of private conversations...
what are you so afraid of? A little paranoid it
seems to me. If your idea of polite company means
people who think and act like you I'd rather not
be in such hateful and biggotted company. As to
the Glosa list, I've been here long before you.
I've exchanged emails on Glosa with Robin for
a long time before you knew what it was Catty.
I hope Glosa interest grows, I hope Interlingua
interest grows. I even hope English use grows in
the Globe. However unlike you I see no contradiction
in any of those situations.

For me Interlingua serves a different purpose
than either Glosa or English serve. It is a means
of access to Western Vocabulary that is shared
among many nations. Glosa is a means of easy
access to terms that are found in Western languages
and the essence of those communications, it has
a limited vocab because of its design, it has
easily mastered mechanics that make it good enough
to use. English on the other hand is a language
without bounds, it is bouncing freely and it is
a means of access to the international vocabulary
as Glosa is and Interlingua more so because of its
design. But English has the force of commerce
behind it and the spirit of modern technology
keeping it in the forefront of international
communications. I see no conflict amont the three.
Whatever you see through your darkly colored
lenses must be a sad and lonesome sight, I feel
sorry for you mate. St. John's Wort is good for
that they say... ;-)))

To me that sounds like typical teacher's talk.  In spite of all your
hate against your pupils's motivation and their low ability - that is
certainly punished by you with pleasure -, you cannot deny that some
words are easy to memorize and some not, independent of the aptitude
of a single pupil.
Look:
  rosa        - rose
  lepidoptera - butterfly
When you do not see a difference here, all your certificates you are
proud of have no value.  In an auxlang the easier words must be
prefered.  Abstract final vowels must be mnemotechnically handable,
possibly with etymology.

Your allegory is nice for natural languages and to protect minority
languages and rare dialects, seems also good for auxlang oldtimers like
Volapük and Esperanto.  But for a constructed language that is under
construction yet it is de-structive.  It blocks development.  I really
like your beautiful websites and I really did not wanted to believe
Charles, that you are destructive, but now I get this feeling by
reading YOUR own mails.

Let me emphasize the positive and con-structive things:
We got a letter from Wendy Ashby, she is Glosa author and THE
authority.  The letter was posted here on 00-09-30, please read.
Now the problems "SILVA/SILVI (forest)" and "ATRIA/ATRIO/ATRIU (hall)"
are solved, namely to silva and atriu.  And we got the information
that the words of the book "Central Glosa" should be prefered to the
ones of the book "Glosa 6000".  That is a lot!
Soon I will send the Similar Synonyms list
(www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ) to her and it seems possible that
the items listed there (over 1000) could be cleared up the same way.
Please try to see that this is a success and a step ahead.

In my mail of 00-09-30 (some did not understand) I just was
disappointed about the focus for the final vowels only set on English.
It should be either classical (Ancient Greek and Latin.  This way is
refused by Wendy's letter explicitly, and perhaps it is really a step
back in language history.) or naturalistic (right word? I mean the
thing with modern languages), but then more languages than only
English must be taken into consideration.

But maybe I misunderstood Wendy here.  The article of "Plu Glosa Nota"
she sent and I will soon post tells about English AND French, German
and Russian.  If so, I would be satisfied.  Again sorry, that I spread
my frustration into this list, though I myself do not like destructive
people.  Penite e poli saluta - Marcel

Jay's gallery of IALs is a morgue. Jay aspires to be the IAL
undertaker/mortician, he likes them dead and harmless.
And please always say "development", Jay chokes on "evolution".

We need to form an authorized Glosa steering committee. Otherwise,
the language dies with its authors to be mummified in Jay's morgue.
(Some say he likes to poison them when they're still alive ...)

It's OK to examine English derivatives to discover the right
etymological vowel, usually. Most -ation words point back
to Latin -a, -ition to -i, and -tion or -ssion to -e.
Similarly for other suffixes, the pattern remains (embalmed)
in English ... Greek is more difficult, but most Glosa words
are Latinate-English.

I would disagree, I don't see this as some race with
several contestants running for the finish. It is
rather like a garden, with all sorts of flowers
blooming, let them all bloom in my opinion, and
enjoy the beauty of each one. May the prettiest

A computer system could not care less if the

Ooooo. youoooo! ;))) I am a language teacher with
14 years of classroom instruction under my belt.
I've been trained by prof. Rassias from Dartmouth,
and consider myself a linguist, certainly the hours
of training and the post-grad credits would certify
me as one. From this I can vouch that it is not the
learning of vocab that is the hard work. Rather it
is the motivation and the drive to accomplish that
is the worst hindrance against learning a foreign
language. As a Multi-lingual speaker I may have
an easier time than mono-lingual learners in
acquiring a foreign language / auxlang. But the
trick is the wanting to do so. And realizing a
need to accomplish it. No need, no drive to do
it and it is definitely not going to succeed.
There may be physical problems that have nothing
to do with attitude, but rather aptitude or ability.
But I'm convinced that given the right training a
lot can be accomplished.

I dunno, I never thought of it in this way... "via" is
"via" to me like "way" is "way" and I don't break it down
into roots and affixes. The word has a meaning that I can
visualize in my mind. And actually both those words,  "via"
and "way" aren't necessarily 100% identical, although one
can translate the other, but in either case the word has
it's own set of associated experiences.

But glosa is a system where this derivational
system is not really actively proposed. It is
somewhat passive. The Mechanics simply show
in what circumstances the vocab might be of
help in expressing thoughts.

I really don't see the problem. To try to
force Glosa into patters that Eo and other
schematics follow would be extreme. In my
opinion, the fact that Glosa is flexible
in this respect is encouraging, it shows
that it can function as many a natural
language does.

I appreciate the freedom to disagree with whomever.
Thi doesn't necessarily mean that I disrespect anyones
opinion though. Let all the pretty flowers bloom I say.

BTW, We had an Oktober Fest at the Colony Mill Marketplace
here in Keene, NH, yesterday. There were 9 other Jehovah's
Witnesses in attendance, pretty much without each of us
knowing about the others coming to the outdoors concert
and tapping of a special keg of Oktober Fest brew, we
had a good time, Alpine horns included. When you run
into people from several congregations in New England
as this was, it makes the world seem like a very tiny
place indeed. And disagreements seem so unimportant.

Whether your grand-daddy was an ape I wouldn't
want to argue the case. Jesus once called the
pharisees "offspring of vipers", so perhaps a
one such might be more your type.

I certainly do believe that the Almighty did
create. How he did so is not my field of study.
I'm very interested in the development of languages
and the human ability to acquire and use language
to communicate with one another. Sometimes there
is a total breakdown of communication, and some-
times its not even worth the spit wasted, such
as in talking with you. Or as in this case, the
bits wasted.

What this hasto do with Glosa, I dunno. Why you
continue to hound me, this I know well and may
you receive the full recompense.

My only regret  is not having followed through
to be peaceable with all men as far as I'm able.
In your case there are certainly some exceptions.
Now was it homo erectus or some other homo you
claim your ancestry from?

Since,

Subject: [glosalist] the 6848 Glosa words
From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Mon, 02 Oct 2000 11:52:52 -0700


The best thing about Ogden's Basic English and Zamenhoff's
Esperanto (Linqvo Internacia) was that a single sheet of paper
could list the entire vocabulary, making it easy both to read
and write. This is only possible if the vocabulary is limited
to around 1000 roots, and a productive system of word
derivation is designed as part of the language.

Glosa's full vocab has generated much dissatisfaction:
inadequate to span the range of words needed for everyday use,
but too large for anybody to memorize or even comfortably study.
No way this can work for people lacking eurolang background.

People who can memorize 6000+ vocabularies can and do learn
French/Spanish/etc instead of any IAL. They amount to 5%
of the population. IALs are for the 95%. Only 2 strategies
can work; fortunately they can be used simultaneously:

1. concentrated 1000-root list
2. naturalistic open/infinite set

Out of the mass of 6543 or so official Glosa words,
there must be 1000 really good general words, suitable
for a solid-practical and easily-learnable basic vocab.
At random I pick LIG- ...

12345   lig     liga            bind, ligature, tether, tie
5       ligatur ligatura        book-binding
4       lign    karbo ligni     charcoal
245     lign    ligni           timber, wood
4       lign    ligni-pe        carpenter
4       lign    tekto ligni     timber
5       ligr    ligro           baneful

That's basically 7 terms, 3 roots (LIGA, LIGNI, LIGRO).
Hmm ... the Occidental Radicarium has only these 2:
"LIGAR = to bind" and "LIGNE = wood". Kennedy's book
"Word Stems" lists the same 2, with these derivatives:
ligament, ligature, alligation, league, oblige;
ligneous, ligniferous, lignite, lignumvitae.
Of course there are infinitely many more. Well,
what do they know? Let's try the Novial Lexike:

ligamente FED, D Gelenkband. 

lige F ligue, E league, D Liga, Bund, Bündnis
| -ga F lier, E bind, attach, D (fest)binden, zusammenbinden
| -gostreke F trait d'union, E hyphen, D Bindestrich. 

ligne F bois (matière), E wood (material), D Holz
| -naje F charpente, E woodwork, D Holzwerk
| -natri. 

Who cares what Otto Jesperson says?? We'll ask Dr. Gode:

liga ligamento ligamentose ligamine ligar ligatura
ligni-cole lignificar lignification ligni-forme
lignina lignite ligno lignose ligure
Liguria ligus- ligustico ligustro

Sorry I asked ... Anyway, it looks like we stumbled onto
a couple of productive internationally known roots here.
If we kept only the 2/7ths of the Glosa words which are
equally productive and international, that would be cool!

Users would still be at a loss for a system (simple pattern)
to help them derive all those derivatives, but such could
EVOLVE through real-LIVE usage.

Not only that, but these international words are recognizable
with very little study, to over 2 billion busy people today.
It would also put the language teachers out of business.

Very droll, rubbish-jay!
At least you have now copied Don Harlow's tactic

But you are still in the slime; you need to evolve.

Tsk. Now you won't capitalize Glosa either.

Occ allows what you now call "tweaking" but everyone
else calls "real-world use and constant evolution".
There are many sub-dialects under Occidental/Interlingue,
all mutually comprehensible and intermixable. I think
Novial might as well be included as a form of Occidental,
since Jesperson and Ahlberg accepted all of De Wahl's
suggestions.

But I'd much prefer to see Glosa grow as intended by
its authors, Hogben and Clark: creole, not crayola.

By now, you are fooling nobody with your act.
I wouldn't have replied to you if you would just
ignore my posts as suggested 2 months ago.
You are attempting to waste my time, I know ...

> So why not make your own project?

Because the world doesn't need any more, *and* because
only someone who knows most of the European languages
is qualified to make one. I know of someone who can,
but he isn't interested, because of the rabid
ankle-biting can't-do auxlangers like Jay Bowks.

You fanatics have made all the IALs appear foolish.

You get a charge out of this. What kind of idiot are you

Rubbish charles! What may kill glosa is the constant tweaking
that you are so fond of... why not tweak Occi which does have
a long history of "evolutionary" development ;-)

So why not make your own project? What are you afraid of? I'll
certainly include it in the Auxilingua Project pages... there
are quite a few alive projects in there... Eo, Interlingua, and
Ido of course... But unlike your dislike for my pages I've had
a lot of positive feedback on them from folks who are interested
in IALs. Yes,  they are a bit due for an update, and I do hope
to have changes on it soon, so maybe you'll publish your new
creolized/pidgin IAL you seem so fond of...

I think it means king/emperor, and "tsar" also.
"Tsar" supposedly derives from "Caesar",
coming through German and meaning "emperor".

[Dear Alexander, 
  Great that you do so much work.  Thank you!!! 
  At the moment I am adding some "G"-marks (marks for words with Greek 
origin) with help of the book "Glosa 6000" to the Internet Dictionary. 
I thought, the 6000-list is completely inserted already.  But while 
adding "G"s I unfortunately found some errors in the data.  And a lot 
of English meanings are missing.  It seems necessary that the complete 
6000-list will be checked and not only the G-words. 
  For your work I send a list with the done corrections.  I hope it 
helps and does not lessen your motivation.  When I am through the 
6000-Gs I send an dictionary update to you as soon as possible. 
  The problems are mainly in the 6000-words.  The words with "1" and 
"++" are more stable.  When you take these words first, you will also 
get an useful dictionary earlier.  So I wanted to do with the German 
version, but I did not find time for this work yet. ]

Hmm, Glosa 6000 has less words than Robin's file on disk. Do you work with
Internet dic. or with g-e.all?

Yes this work is very difficult. But for me is more easy, because I  make it
through clipboard by my English-dictionary-program.

Subject: [glosalist] Speedwords?
From: Charles <charles{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Fri, 13 Oct 2000 20:26:36 -0700

A guy on another list posted these links, which are
nothing new but still are of great interest ...

> http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.overview

> http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.dir/Speedwords.dict

... because it suddenly occurs to me that this list
of 493 "concepts" based on Roget's, like Glosa's vocab
reportedly was too, could be re-translated directly
back into Glosa to ensure they are really in there.

Speedwords also has a true system of derivation, which
theoretically generates something like 20,000 words total.
Glosa lacks that, still, but why not add it? Might be
a fun/instructive exercise just to try.

I have put together my own personal dictionary from the standard internet one 
and some stuff I did some time ago from 1K and 6K plus a few additions. I 
have pruned the result to suit me, kept most rejected some into two groups, 
words that are repeats or near repeats and some that I don't think I shall 
want to use. The other group are mainly repeats that could be pressed into 
service with slight changes in meaningâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.  






For various reasons, I have laid these aside and at the moment not use them

"
MEGA-GLOSA, BUT ...
===================

As regards your first suggestion.  We agree that to sell Glosa to
bodies such as EEC, UN, UNESCO etc. MEGA-GLOSA, a large vocabulary is
essential.  Scientists, literary people and politicians require it.

We however insist that GLOSA 1000 must remain the Centre, the Heart of
Glosa.  Glosa is a truly International Auxiliary Language.  It will
appeal to the motivated Third World artisan only if it is simple to
learn and accurate, and able to deal with all kinds of information
exchange.  Glosa will not be allowed to fall into the trap of becoming
only a holiday language for wealthy people of the industrialized
nations.  The world will never be healthily united until accurate
information is readily available to everyone everywhere, and everybody
in the world has enough to eat, good shelter and a good-allround
education - an education for living not merely for earning a living.
The world has now the means (but not yet the will) to bring all this
about quickly and thoroughly.

Europeans are used to large vocabularies, which can contribute to mis-
understandings not only between nations but also between classes.  We
hope that although perhaps enjoying the variety and freedom of Mega
Glosa people will at the same time work their way up to Central
Glosa 1000.

Below we make some provisional suggestions for forming a Mega
Vocabulary.  Glosa 6000 by the way has all the information for forming
a truly enormous vocabulary.  We shall bring out a Mega Glosa as soon
as possible.



FINDING THE ROOT
================

All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa is to be able to
recognize a Latin and Greek root.  Most of the common ones will be
listed in Glosa 1000, the others will be in Glosa 6000.  In any long
word of classical origin there may be ...

        Prefix - root - suffix.
   Eg.  SUPER     FLU     OUS

Remember Glosa has no parts of speech; and any Glosa word can act as
any part of speech.  Because the suffix is usually concerned with this
kind of information, whether the word is verb, noun, adjective or
adverb it is usually superfluous for Glosa and can be removed.

If the Prefix is one with a distinct meaning i. e. one of the
35 listed in PGN 36 this must be retained as it contributes to
meaning, to information.  So generalizing;

   Word minus suffix = Prefix + root.

                       the word you want.
In the above example the root is FLU, to flow, SUPER over; therefore
SUPERFLU, overflow.  In a way forming a Mega Glosa Vocabulary involves
'tail-chopping'.



POINTS TO NOTE
==============

Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate.  All you have to do here is
knock off the -te.  confiscate becomes KONFISKA.

Always substitute K for hard Latin c.  So canine becomes KANI, feline
FELI.

Some words ending -age are of French origin.  These can be kept giving
MESAGE, FOLIAGE.

No double letters in Glosa, except on a few occasions where a
well-trilled r may have a good echoic effect.  Some examples;

 English        GLOSA
 delicious      DELICI        degenerate  DEGENERA
 industrialize  INDUSTRI      subsequent  SUBSEQUE
 contortion     KONTORTI      population  POPULA

In 99 % of all cases this simple method will work perfectly, but
occasionally some part of the suffix may be found useful and can be
retained.

Words ending -ism  add -o.   REALISMO.  KOMUNISMO.
Words ending -ist  add -i.   REALISTI.  FATALISTI.
Words ending -ment add -a.   PARLAMENTA.  MOVIMENTA.

Biological and medical terms remain unchanged; OAKTREE is QUERKUS.
K can be substituted for Latin C.  Musical terms remain unchanged,
many of these were listed in PGN 16.  Eg. KRESCENDO, FORTISIMO,
DIMUNENDO, ACELERANDO.  French endings like -age above should be
given the French pronounciation.



THE TWO PARTS OF THE LATIN VERB
===============================

Another possibility of variety arises from the fact that the Latin
verb has two parts, each of which gives rise to great numbers of
Euro-verbs.  Eg;
  to see         infinitive       VIDE  as in VIDEO
                 past participle  VISum as in VISion.
So for GLOSA 'to see' can be rendered by VIDE or VISI.  Other
examples;
  join together  i.               NEKT  as in conNECT
                 pp.              NEXU  as in NEXUs.
  to lead        i.               DUCE  as in reDUCE
                 pp.              DUCT  as in conDUCT.



WHEN IS A WORD INTERNATIONAL
============================

In PGN 35 there was an article on PACTERM, Pan-African-Centre for
TERMinology, centredin Addis Ababa.  All the participants at a recent
seminar in Ethiopia agreed that a term should be recognized as
international when it appeared in French, German, Russian and English.
We use a very large German-Russian Dictionary published in Moscow by
A. A. Lepinga & Straxhovoi.

See also, the article about INFOTERM in this issue.



KOSMOPOLITAN GREEK
==================

It has been said that if all the words of Greek origin were suddenly
removed from the world's dictionaries all intelligent conversation
would come to an end.  Nowadays scientists turn almost exclusively to
Greek for new terminology.  Three ways by which you can recognize
words of Greek origin.

1) There are many double consonants. Eg;
   PSYCHOLOGY, CATARRH, RHYTHM, THEME, ARCHITECT, HYPHEN, PNEUMONIA.
2) There are many diphthongs; Eg
   EUPHONY, HAEMOGLOBIN
3) All those words in which ch is pronounced like a k.  Eg;
   ARCHITECT, CHARACTER.

The Greek words are not quite so familiar yet as the Latin, but they
are daily becoming ever more so.  TELE-SCOPE, SYMBOL, SYMPTOM,
SYMPHONY are all Greek, and they never have undergone any changes.
They are however far more international than the Latin.  They
probably make up a half of Glosa 6000; and the Advanced Glosa
Dictionary is almost entirely Greek.

> a victim of English's ridiculous spelling

I used to think that way, but now I think it's only
the English pronunciation that is ridiculous.
Same for French. Our archaic pre-sound-shift spelling
preserves all the beautiful Greco-Latin derivatives.

Glosa was originally based on these derivatives,
but the relationship was lost by a naive and misguided
"fonetic" spelling. There are many people in Europe
who cannot speak or understand English *speech*, but
can read/write it very acceptably because of these
cognate words and their formal book-study.

Occidental was based on "archaic" etymological spelling,
which remains recognizable across most European languages
today in derivative/scientific words. This is the true
international vocabulary, natural and non-apriori.

So I recommend that English/French/Spanish all return
to a truer etymological spelling, and adjust their
pronunciation to fit the writing, not the reverse!
If that were done, we would find that 50% of the words
are identical, and not need any artificial interlanguage.
This E-F-S language that already exists in writing
covers 4 of the 7 continents and half the population ...

Glosa should join that party, in its next revision.

Nice polemic, good thought.

> Europeans are used to large vocabularies

Those vocabularies are built using relatively few
(5000) roots and a set of derivational affixes.
There is a natural system to it, somewhat irregular.
The task of a designed language should be to identify
the roots, spell them in the most internationally
recognizable fashion, and provide a regular set of affixes.

> All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa

Dangerous idea, I like it.

> Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate.

Also, -ion, -ive, -ous, -ary, -ory, -ble, -bly, -ure,
and about 200 others. In Spanish, same story.

> Always substitute K for hard Latin c.

Big mistake, because it breaks the derivational families,
e.g. FACt/FACile conDUCive/DUCtile ... myriads more.
Same for soft-G. Better to throw out K and Q both.
And Z and X and W and maybe Y. And H. But J may be useful.

> Some words ending -age are of French origin.  These can be kept giving

Latin, -aticus; present in every European language as
-age and related -agie but spelled often with J.

> No double letters in Glosa

I think that's also a mistake: "ad + cept = ac-cept",
"in + rigare = irrigate". Anything that disguises etymology
also prevents recognition and is evil.

> Words ending -ism  add -o.   REALISMO.  KOMUNISMO.

You are being too reasonable, nobody will agree to that!
Anyway, better to leave out useless final vowels altogether,
maybe even use "realist, realism, realistic, realisar,
realisat, realisation, realisator, ..."

> Biological and medical terms remain unchanged

Scientific terms mutate more swiftly than the flu virus.
Nobody understands such jargon, why bother with it?

Only 1% of the population will ever hear music of that type,
sad to say. It's just jargon anyway, doesn't belong in an IAL.

> THE TWO PARTS OF THE LATIN VERB

Very interesting stuff, but I doubt the Glosa authors
ever studied Latin or other interlanguages ... deaf ears.
Maybe I'm being too harsh, and I hope so. What we need is
a "Glosa Academy" to design version 3, if it is to survive.

> WHEN IS A WORD INTERNATIONAL

> international when it appeared in French, German, Russian and English.

German has not embraced the international roots, therefore
must be left out: there aren't many roots common to this set
of languages. Better is Spanish/English/French: there are
at least 20,000 words available, to be reduced to 5000 roots.
(Spanish could be augmented by Portuguese, to avoid ill-effects
of its unfortunate PL-->LL etc. sound changes.)

I would eliminate Greek, but the other Glosa people won't.
Many reasons, but I'll leave that for elsewhen.

What a brave attempt by Marcel, to raise so many issues at once!
And they are mainly the essential ones. I hope Wendy will
take this *positively*, though I somehow don't expect so.
If 10 or so people decide to make a new reformed Glosa, though,
it could actually happen and might be very successful.

For myself, I can't quite see which way Glosa *should* evolve.
More like the naturalistic Novial/Occidental? More creolish
like Lingua Franca? More Greek like the Koine? Something else?
Whatever, I'd just like it to be more consistent and true
to its own principles, whatever they may be.

I am not sure, whether it became clear, so please let me note:  What I 
have posted 00-10-14 was an article of "Plu Glosa Nota", issue 37, the 
official Glosa newspaper. 

These are original words of the Glosa authors, Ron and Wendy, not 
mine!!!

This is part of my personal G to E dictionary from the standard internet one. 
The words I've put aside are in files I've put on different messages.It will 
get further pruning as time goes on and will be somewhat shorter than the 
original. I'm rather of the opinion that many of the hyphens could be 
dispensed with and the dictionary could be with advantage shortened still 
further.  The dictionary has "ad ", "epi" , "ad-epi" . if  "ad-epi" became 
"ad epi" we would need only 2 entries instead of 3 and if all the entries 
beginning with "no-*****" were " no *****", there would be a large saving of 
space.

When learning a natural language like French,
or in my case trying but not succeeding,
the major difficulty is that any variance from
Parisian usage is *wrong* and unacceptable.

But in an artificial bridge language,
there needs to be tolerance for variation.
All the users are new learners, and they must
feel free to speak/write without becoming
a target for criticism.

So any reasonably understandable spelling or
choice of words or etc should be encouraged as
necessarily *correct*. The only criterion for
proper usage is understandability. Good style
will be determined by popularity in actual use.

English went through a long period of unstandard
spelling, which did stop Shakespeare from using it
effectively, but stern schoolmasters were unhappy ...

The Glosa Internet Dictionary on my site has been updated again.  

Changes: 
- "G"-marks (for Greek words) have been added with the book 
    "Glosa 6000". 
- The English meanings of these Greek words have been compared, the 
    found errors corrected and missing English meanings added 
    (About 200 things.  A check of the complete Glosa-6000-data is 
    necessary.). 
- The alphabetical sorting has been improved. 

The corrections are protocoled in 
  www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz . 
Lines 1800 to 1986 may be interesting for Alexander, Robin and all 
users of Robin's GLOSA.ALL-file.  Because GLOSA.ALL has been one of 
the source files for the Internet Dictionary, a lot of the found 
Dictionary's errors are in GLOSA.ALL, too.  I posted the examples A to 
H in Glosalist 00-10-04 already. 

I sent a paper copy of the dictionary to Wendy Ashby.  

URLs as before.  Place visita.  Saluta Marcel.

-------------------------
[ In my last mail I told that I sent a paper copy of our Glosa 
Internet Dictionary to Wendy Ashby.  Yesterday I got an encouraging 
reply from her. 
  When Ron died, she seemed to need distance from Glosa (look her 
letters I posted 00-08-04 and 00-09-30).  Now it looks like she 
returns and continues working for Glosa a bit.  
    // {"Inter-tem, ko tu auxi e gentili stimula mi re-proto Glosa 
    // aktivi; pro u-ci, mega gratia!"} 
  She even wrote that she would rather work full time for Glosa, but 
she needs to earn her living. 
  I am especially happy, that she will go through my Similar Synonyms 
list (see www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ), because I think, 
that, when these problems are solved, Glosa's chances will grow. 
She sent two pages full of valuable notes to the list's items to me. 
And I hope to get more. 
    // {"Si mi ergo mo pagina ex kron a kron, sura mi fu fini id."} 
I will build them all into the dictionary then. ]

There is now a new web page with a dictionary of glosa words culled from 
glosalist and thier english equvalents from the internet dictionary. Unlike 
you concientious and hardworking compilers whom I envy, I am rather idle and 
confine my efforts to those words I use or read. It would be a good idea, I 
think, to compile a shorter and pocket dictionary on these lines which would 
be parallel to G1000. The address is:-
   http://hometown.aol.co.uk/sydpidd/myhomepage/writing.html

I have also ordered a translating program and will try to use it to compile 
short lists of Glosa to French, spanish, Japanese etc. I don't know how 
successful it will be but it could be a basis for further work. I will do one 
in German for Marcell to comment on and indicate how useful the others will 
be. Copmments generally will be welcome.

"Conscientious and hardworking", hehe, nice but exaggerated 
compliment.  Nevertheless, please, please, please, Syd, try to take 
the Core-dictionary of the Internet Dictionary 
    (www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gcoglen.htm and 
    www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gcoengl.htm ) 
instead of making a total new one.  We tried to parallelize it with 
Glosa 1000 already and we tried to use a bit linguistic statistics as 
scientific background for the word election.  There is so much to do 
with Glosa, so do not let us waste our energy with making boring work 
double.  When you think, Core is only rubbish, no problem: make 
comments and we will change it.

Great.  Please send it and I will look.  For French I bought 
"Glosa 1000 - Francais" from Wendy.  I wanted to put it on the net, 
but it is still not typed in yet.  When it will be ready, I will tell 
you and you can compare it with your program's output.

obrigado!
the Portugese use (abuse?) of final vowels is worth commenting on after all 
the discussion on glosalist - to follow
I think you misunderstand my intentions. My work on the dictionary is based 
on yours, I have added a few odds and ends -very few but the core dictionary 
is extraordinarily (73 years old and is struggling to spell his mother 
tongue!) long with many repeated and redundant words such as "position" -> 
"topo " and "loko" if I remember rightly also "zefir" fror west wind which is 
not likely to be used much. I am going through with the help of programs I've 
cobbled together  , to make a smaller pocket sized version of words that I 
actually use. I'm doing the same with as much of the glosalist glosa too. We 
are both doing different but useful work - we need the full one and also 
smaller ones from it
I am going to put together a web page with lots of glosa as glosalist seems 
to be mostly english which defeats the list's object
more to follow

Suggestions to reduce the amount of words in Core are always welcome.  
But your both examples are not right.  "zefiro  west wind" is only in 
Literary, not in Core.  And "loko" is in Core, "topo" not, although 
there is a difference, as Nick explained recently:  "loko" is 
place/area, "topo" is place/point.  See also PGN 71, p. 4.

These are great ideas, and your work will *not* be wasted.
In discussions on the Occidental lists, I've seen an odd effect:
people benefit more from making their own word lists than
from having a big thick official dictionary.

Dictionaries aren't very readable, so they don't speed-up
language acquisition, and the sheer mass of 6000 entries only
convinces people that they can never hope to master the language.
Glosa's shorter vocab and categorized lists are a big help.
Still, the ideal hasn't been reached (whatever that is).

A linguist friend of mine can quickly learn almost any language,
to a passable and usable degree, by translating his own list
of approximately 1500 essential words. I only know I can *not*
memorize over a thousand vocabulary items ...

This led me to the concept of the already-existing international
vocabulary based on Greco-Latin, as used in several well-known IALs.
European-language speakers (adult, literate) are already familiar
with these words or their cognate forms, etc etc.

In reading Glosa I have trouble with many of the words, some vaguely
recognizeable but ambiguous, others just completely unfamiliar.
Writing is easier, paradoxically, but seems almost like a code.
Not enough vocab, yet too much. Hence my dissatisfaction.
But maybe it works better for other people, or non-Euros.

Speculation follows ...

My own idea would be to take the super-productive verb roots
as discussed earlier, and try to build an entire vocab from them.
The basic ("light") verbs such as BE/HAVE/DO would be included
along with a few that have no super-productive equivalent.

Those (approximately) 100 verb-roots would be *all* ...
Learnable in a single weekend, easy to print on a single page.
Similarly, basic adjectives and adverbs would be defined,
just a limited set, e.g. things like "up" "good" "many".
Then a group of general-category nouns must be added, enough
for general discourse. Roughly then, 500 words in total.

Specific discussions would incorporate other words from the
international air, but not all of those words need to be listed
in an official dictionary, especially since they change so fast.
Today we need "vote" and "snippy", tomorrow something else.

The goal would be a list that can be learned and used easily and
most rapidly by an average adult who has some exposure to some
European language. Maybe it would work for Arabic, Turkish,
or some other language speakers as well. Anyway, it could
actually *work* ... A language for "eternal beginners" (like
Esperanto) is worse than useless.

I like Occidental well enough, but if Glosa can beat it
(by being easier or faster to learn by more people), great!
Or if we can borrow good compatible features between IALs,
better yet. A short basic word list is an important element.

I have loko and topo=put like the difference place area/point    this is what 
I am after with some of the repeats
the next bit I did yesterday     make of it what you can     some other 
interesting points this month I'll think about them
what we need most is lots of Glosa!

Dear Marcel
I seem to be working on a core dictionary from both top down and from bottom 
up. I'm getting a program to translate my english to glosa starting with the 
internet one (IND) and checking what it throws up. Often I get several glosa 
words and I check which I want and put the others in other files, this means 
that my own dictionary is getting tidied up and material that I don't want is 
pruned away. I am also going through glosa that is on glosalist and saving 
most of it. Doing this builds up some sort of core of words that are actually 
in use rather than slaving through a long long dictionary. My results I shall 
put on web pages every so often so that you can use the results if you want.
An example is the kroma thing I did.
I try to do a Charlie Darwin on it - natural selection or something.
Imagine a peasant in south asia...... name of  Andrews 
Killingham-Winton...... he knows only his own dialect but has a pocket 
Glosa/his dialect dictionary. He is having trouble with his crop and is 
asking a scientists .....Ping Pong of northern Europe for advice PP knows 
only his own language and also has an apropriate G dic.
(I did ask my printer to print out the internet G dic, it remarked that I 
must be joking - there were 92 pages!!)
 Among the symptoms were yellow leaves. When AK-W looked yellow up he found, 
as youknow from "Kroma", 6 words. This is where CD comes in..... Xanto has a 
double consonant cluster "nt" and a one and a half cluster begin K+s for "X". 
Now, some south asians as far as I know don't like double consonants so 
"xanto" got naturally selected out! Safro's "fr" was more acceptable but 
"leuko" with CVCV was naturally selected in and used. 
(If  I remember correctly, there are about 17000 or so entries in the IND, if 
there are on average 3 choices for the same English word and they are prunes 
to one, the IND shrinks to about 6000 !!)
(As far as I am concerned, I suspect I normally use about 4000 different 
concepts [ go, went, going, goes, gone etc are all variants of the one 
concept] so there are probably quite a few expressions etc in IND that  I am 
not likely to use much so my core dictionary could be quite small)
AK-W's crop had a local name like "lords and ladies" for instance so that he 
had no idea what it was. Obviously they need to use the scientific names as 
inculing them in the core d would make it impossibly long. 
While I was away, my files were cleared out presumably by AOL and I lost the 
addresses of your dictionary websites. I'd like to compare them with what I'm 
doing.
sorry about my burbling on but it will give me a chance of adding more glosa 
to search for extra words for my core effort.

I think your sentence is ambiguous:

"I have persuaded .. to work and (I) put .. " or
"I have persuaded .. to work and (I have) put .. ".

    If this interests you, ask me to send the "G-ASCII Analysed Syntax" scheme: can you imagine teaching syntax in the abstract?

>___|___|___  

*   Unless sentence style is taught and drilled, I suspect that learner will have to observe written Glosa, and 'intuit' the way sentences are put together in Glosa.  This was the method I used; however, by treating Glosa as a "concept language", i.e. one in which the abstractions of communication are paramount, I developed a feel for articulating the concepts.  Most languages facilitate a "concrete" approach to the juggling of 'things', objects, actions and descriptions.

*   With such knowlege, the trick is to put your 'inexact' sentences on the Glosalist and asking others to look at how you have done it, IE

  Kron tu grafo uti Glosa, don u sekunda line te monstro tu tende.

(when you write using Gl. give a second line in-order-to show your interntion) 

  [When you write in Glosa do a second line to show your intention.]

*   It was a shock to me, when I first discovered such an inability to find a way of expressing a particular idea.  I am not talking about vocabulary deficiencies, though these can be very annoying, I suggest that it might seem impossible to get your mind around some particular combination of ideas, Glosa-wise.  I used the 'tell-a-story' method at first: I think of this as the "discursive" way of using language; if pushing a small number of words together does not produce a satifying rendition of your idea, then the concepts involved might need to be teased out to make a more long-winded, descriptive senternce.  

   Eventually, after doing this exercise a few times, you can start to recognise concept-heavy ideas coming up, and then, mentally, you start teasing the ideas apart before you come to actually speaking or writing.



> 8. A better dictionary is needed before I can feel happy

>inattempting to use Glosa.

>possibly.

*   For some people this was an insurmountable barrier to using Glosa.  But, working on vocabulary projects, as you have done, certainly raises your awareness of the usage of the different words.  

   For example, in thinking about the Glosa "water" synonyms, aqa (L.) and hidro (G.), I came to realise that water was not only the clear stuff you get out of a tap, but that there were many ways of thinking about 'water.  So, I came up with a range of 'water' situations and then tried out aqa and hidra, alternately, in these situations.  Perhaps it can be thought of as letting the feel of the word, in the mouth, decide your usage.


> 9. An instruction manual is needed before I can feel happy

>                   in attempting to use Glosa.

>Maybe.

*   It would certainly be a good idea, but originally Ron was not in favour of rule-based learning for Glosa; instead, he suggested more the "do as I do" method.

    One of the main reason for Glosa's slow development could be this lack of specific instruction on the fine-points of usage and sentence construction.

    While Glosalist members are taken up with refinements to the lexicon, we are not using our abilities to move on to the next step .. of specifying the rules behind the language, and forming traditional exercises for learners to go through, to practice them.


> 10. A basic grammar book will improve my use of Glosa.

>Yes.

*   This was my reason for attempting to produce one.

    I got good advice from other members of the planned language Mailing Lists during the process, and attempted to modify the tabulation of Glosa Grammar to include the suggestions.

    I think I included it on my website.  By inspection of written Glosa, any other observer could abstract a similar set of usage rules, and make his,or her, own 'Glosa Grammar.'


> 11. A basic grammar book is needed before I can feel happy in

>                   attempting to use Glosa.

>No.

*  This is a fortunate answer, because, at present such an *official* Glosa Grammar does not exist.  However, your response is 'correct' in that the usage is so regularised and standardised, that the inherent rules can generally be perceived and applied without taught instruction.

*  Well asked.

   To standardise the use of the interrogative, the Glosa authors favoured a simple indication that a following statement should be taken as a question, by placing the 'flag, ~qe~, before the statement.

   However, the authors included a range of other "question-words" in the dictionary as well, because a speaker does not always want to reveal his question at the beginning of his sentence, or, perhaps, not even realise that he intends to put his information into the form of a question, until after he has started the sentence.  Most of these are found under "Q" in the dictionary, and were well covered in _Glosa Classified_. 

  ~Qe, an akti uno-ra?~

  (question: he does something)   ..  more, or less, means,

  "Is he doing something?"


  However, this pattern falls down if you want know what a person is doing.

  ~An akti qod?~ seems better than ..


  ~Qe, an akti qod?~,  ~Qe, qod akti an?~,  ~Qe, qod an akti?~ or ~Qod akti an?~.


   And then if we are looking for something, we could say,

 ~Qe, tu ski id loka?~  -- for "Do you know where it is?"


However, ~Qo-lo u ra?" and "Qe, u ra habe qod loka?~  don't seem as good.  We can try raising the question after making a statement, EG

   ~Memo un argenti; tu pa habe pa-di: qo-lo id habe nu?~.


   So, there probably are no rules .. beyond the the way the question feels comfortable for you.  The best way to reach a comfortable question format that is meaninful to others, as well, is to practise asking the same question in a number of different ways.

  

    I do apologise for not using Glosa to respond to your post, and also for not answering two months ago.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

How does ET work? Did you write it? Will it work on
other-than-Microsoft? Can it generate a web page, i.e. CGI?

My old sample http://catty.com/~catty/lang/dict.cgi
takes Glosa text and generates an English mini-glossary.
It accepts a certain simple format so could work with
other dictionaries.

Glosa is easy because there's so little morphology, but still
one can't quite do an effective word-for-word translation.

Dear Alex
I too find Glosa not as easy as it seems and have often had difficulty 
understanding some parts of PGN. However that also applies to English and to 
Hindi/Urdu and other languages I've tinkered with.Often with Glosa, I am not 
sure which is the verb(to have, to follow etc). See what you think of the 
following:-
Nu-di mana, u fo pusi obesi andro ko longi e melani trika pa tako sed gentile 
dona plu kloro avi a u an gina.
In Glosa the verb phrase is somewhere near the middle, like English but 
unlike Hindi (at the end) or Welsh (at the beginning [I think]), you can find 
the phrase by finding the word "pa". This word announces the beginning of the 
phrase and also indicates time. The end of the phrase is at the beginning of 
the next one, the word "plu". The signals for the start of a VP (verb phrase) 
are "pa", "fu", "nu" sometimes and "du". Unfortunately,the VP does not have 
this signal and this is often where I get lost.
In Glosa, the words in a group  like "tako sed gentile dona" tend to become 
more important towards the end and add precision to the last word's meaning. 
There are all sorts of ways one can give; willingly, reluctantly......... and 
so on and here the author has added "gentile" as an adverb ( makes the verb 
more precise) and also "tako". The conjunction"but" makes the status of 
"tako" and "gentile" equal and draws attention to the apparent contradiction 
in the two term's meaning.
In Glosa, the subject noun phrase normally is in front of the VP, this one is 
signalled by the beginning "u" and the end is where the VP begins .
u fo pusi obesi andro.........
ko longi e melani trika.........
"longi" and "melani" are connected with "e", they are both as important as 
each other and they both make more precise the meaning of "trika". The hair 
is both black and long.
The "ko" joins this group to "andro" and adds more precision as it is his 
hair.
There is no "and" or "but" before "andro".
"obesi" adss precision to "andro" - he is fat, "pusi" adds precision to the 
following word "obesi"- he is slightly fat, the "fo" adds to " pusi" so he is 
very slightly fat. 
"plu kloro avi" starts with "plu", the next phrase starts with "a u", this is 
all after the verb and is the direct object of the verb.
"a u an gina" This is the indirect object of the verb
He gave the birds to the woman
"kloro" adds precision to "avi", "u an" (the his) to "gina"
Actually, this looks very like the subject "u andro ko trika" and "u avi a u 
gina" but the meaning makes the construction clear. I am not very happy with 
that state of affairs and need to ponder.
"Nu-di mana," This phrase can be omitted without radically affecting the 
meaning of the sentence, it expresses time as does the verb and could become 
pa nu-di mana e tako sed gentile dona . This would be clumsy and, as there is 
only one verb phrase and it is clearly time, it can be moved to other places. 
The same cannot be done with "obese" as you would not know to which noun, 
"andro, trika,avi or gina" was obese.
Hope you can make something of all this, it has made me think .

I bought ET from Dream..........software - you put english in the top panel 
and it produces a translation in the bottom one. I sent some ET german to 
Marcel, he found a few faults in the two or three sentences but I think he 
understood reasonably well what I was saying. I made my own program that 
called it and worked on its results. It seems to be pretty limited it was 
without about 5 or 10% of the words in the Glosa Core Dictionary. I would say 
that for its price and aims, it is quite adequate. I think it is available on 
machines other than PC. This may not be fair as only used a few of its 
facilities.They have a Web site
www.eDREAM.co.uk
What I should like is reasonably comprehensive english to other language dics 
that I could address as text files Shall bash on regardless for a while

    Due to personal circumstances I unsubscribed from Glosalist for a
time.  A few days ago I resubscribed, but about the only posts have
been very long files from Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com (if I have the address
right).  My mail filters automatically discard mail over a certain
size unless I make special arrangments, because I have to pay extra
real money if a large volume of mail pushes me over my disk allotment. 
Also, certain types of graphic files are of no use to me, anyway.  I at
least would appreciate knowing what these oversize files are so I can
have some idea what I am missing.

They are wordlists with Glosa, English and a third lang with
thousands of entries with this formula below. Actually pretty good
work

a ( ad) =  A  = at
a ( ad) =  A  = to
a ( ad) =  Verso  = towards
a fini =  Eventualmente  = eventually
a latu =  A parte  = aside
a-kron =  Puntuale  = punctual
a-kron =  Fino a  = till
a-kron =  Finché  = until
a-nu =  Ancora  = yet
ab =  Assente  = absent
ab =  Lontano  = away
ab =  Da  = from
ab =  Via da  = off
abili =  Capace  = able

etc.

Kudos on the compiling! Perhaps it would be a good
idea to have them as zipped up text files for ftp
download on the net.

w/regards,
Jay B.

Best is to make a web directory like, ahem, mine:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/ ... Then you can update
the files and simply announce the changes, giving
the URL. Also, you can ensure they are correctly
uploaded and readable, by checking via browser.
Only a few people will see your files here, but many
more will find you on the web, via search engines and
reciprocal links. But beware the web-groupies ... j/k.

The situation now is that we have "Glosainnercore" to and from French,  
Spanish, Italian, Portugese on my harddisc and the possibility of Japanese. 
We have Glosacore in English and German. Core gradually split into innercore 
and outercore when my translator informed me that some of core's English was 
not on EasyTranslator's list. I therefore took it off the Glosacore and 
slowly innercore grew. 
My next step is to take outercore and translate it the hard way from 
dictionaries. I have a Portugese one with me so that will be the first. I 
don't know how it will go.

I did try to upload dictionaries onto a web page but AOL seems to have made 
things difficult lately. It would be a good idea if someone took my 
dictionaries onto his/her 
machine.
I did not finish the German because it seemed pointless to try to do what has 
already been done and by someone infinitely more able to do it. If, however 
you would like to to see mine, I could send one to you

    If these could be made available for fetching other than by email I
could handle them, especially if they were zipped.  If Sydpidd(?) does
not have the facilities for this, perhaps some other kind soul could
assist.

One more thing about multilingual word-lists: They should have
a neutral and easily-machine-parse-able format. The standard
way is by tab- (and/or comma-) separated columns, e.g. ...

	Glosa, English, Chinese
	equs,  horse,   ma2

In the many cases of synonyms, best is to duplicate the whole line.
One could also add comments, but only beyond the last column
and/or introduced by a "metacharacter":

	# here are various animal species
	hipo, horse, ma2, # Greek source
	equs, horse, ma2  # blah blah blah

I don't really like whole-line comments to be interspersed,
because they are not easily loaded into a spreadsheet.

* Hi Paul,
  With apologies for my non-activity of late.

  Sid's long files are matchings of French language words with the Glosa
1000 list.  He includes a number of French words with similar meanings to
the Glosa words, though not all could be termed synonyms.

  The French to Glosa list has the previous (Glosa to French) list
reversed, but not SORTed.
 
  I attach - in the body of the e-mail in 'text' (not word document form)-
the beginning of each to give you an idea of the full lists:-

The files were glosa to french,italian,spanish etc dictionaries. I wanted to 
put then on a web page but I'm having difficulties partly because of my own 
incompetence and I think AOL is re-organising itself. I have sent them to 
Marcel at his non-list address. If you are not interested in them, just 
ignore them.

About that great web site on the CJ, a pidgin language greatly
resembling (in my opinion) Glosa in its function and structure ...

: Geocities has changed the addressing scheme for GeoPlus sites;
: formerly these sites were accessed in the form of
: www.geocities.com/~membername or optionally without the tilde (~).
: Now these sites may only be accessed in the form of
: www.geocities.com/membername (without the tilde).

: Would you please update your link to my site to reflect this change?
: The "Tenas Wawa" web site is still up, but now only as

http://www.geocities.com/tenaswawa/

This may effect many other popular Geocities sites
as well, I would suppose.
