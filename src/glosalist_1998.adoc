1a works for me. On second thought, how about a slight change... "Fe pa ki
a propria domi." The other translations seem to lose the idea that it is
her own home to which she is going, and that's what the English says to me.
Alternatives: NOSTO = return home -> "Fe pa nosto." EKO = dwell ->
"Fe pa ki a propria eko-do."

2g - I never did like that mysterious "it", so "id" is out. We're
measuring something here, and the something is temperature (and, well,
I'm assuming temperature of the air!) so here goes... "U temperatura
metri hepta-ze grada." Aside: There is no word for temperature in G1000
or G6000. Shall we add your Latin selection?

3h. Or perhaps 3k... "U kumu pa mega." Is "is" really needed here?

4m with a slight modification: "An pa bate se." I'm still kind of torn
between AUTO and SE, but the latter feels more reflexive to me. And we
need to distinguish between doing something *by* oneself and doing
something *to* oneself; that's why I removed the hyphen. The compound
version says to me that he himself did the hitting - but what did he hit?

Tricky one, this. Complicated by that E connecting a couple of sentences
that could almost have stood alone. If two separate sentences, I'd surely
use PA in both. I'll pick 5p. The two components just aren't coupled
tightly enough for me, for the tense of the one to flow into the other.

6u (though I'd be tempted to use 6v for literary purposes). I almost feel
like I'm contradicting myself now, after what I wrote about #5, but here
I see three actions, and the first two are bound together timewise (the
comma does that for me) so I see the third following right after those
two - so we only need the one PA.

7y, with maybe the ES removed? After reading Robin's comments on "is",
I've been thinking about this and suspect that there's another case to
add to his four, and that's the one where we use "is" or some other when
*none* is really needed. This seems to be common in natlangs, for common
verbs like "is" and "have" to spawn idioms.

Bill, 
	I am a bit worried.  I sent my "Hedo Neo Anua" message to the Glosalist,
but your reply came to me - addresses to my email address - with no
reference to "glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au".

	To which address did you send the post: Glosalist, or me, personally? 

	I wonder, if you send a post to the Glosalist, and a subscriber answers
it, will his reply go back out to all Glosalist subscribers, or will his
reply just go to you, as the originator of the message?

	It looks as if a 'switch' has been omitted, something like:-

Reply Address: glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

	I will have to look into this.  So .. would Glosalist subscribers, until
further notice (when I have turned on the 'switch'), please use "Redirect"
or type in  glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au  when "Reply"ing to a Glosalist posting.

*	Interesting: Glosa is quite open-plan, but will it work, at the initial
disemination stage, with such optionality built in?  I had thought that 
	~a fe domi~  meant "to her house", but without context, we can't exactly
identify the ~fe~: it usually relates to the first female, but could refer
to a second female person.
	I feel that 'intent' and 'emphasis' are relevant when we select either 
~domi~ or ~eko-do~.  ~Domi~ is the more normal concept of ''house/home'',
while ~eko~ has a more ''geographical'' feel to it - as I see the two
concepts as distinct ideas.

	~U kumu pa mega.~ feels like "The heap bigged." (grew itself bigger)
	Although words can within reason function as any part of speech, ~mega~
is more like one of the 'function words'.  As a 'modifier' I see it more as
modifying things than actions.  In English, I see "big" as the result of
elision in sentences like "He is big", omitting the "a" and "man".
	My preference is i.

    If a clause has a third-person singular subject and then in the
predicate there is a third-person singular pronoun or pronominal
adjective with the same sexual referent, there can be ambiguity, as in
English.  Various languages, including at least some of the Romance
languages following Latin, resolve this with reflexive pronouns.  A
reflexive pronoun refers to the subject of the clause in which it
appears in the predicate.  If the third-person predicate reference is 
not via a reflexive, then it referes to other than the subject.

    In the instance cited, the use of _fe_ could be ambiguous even in a
complete clause.  I suggest that Glosa could resolve the ambiguity by
using _se_ or _auto_ as a reflexive in the predicate to refer to the
subject of the clause.  Otherwise, _fe_, _an_, _id_ would refer to
other than the subject.

I agree with the suggestion.  Russian also has a reflexive pronoun 
(s'eb'a) for all persons, and it is extremely useful in such situations 
as this.
As you see, I am just about back into writing notes.  In fact, I am 
returning VERY gradually to practise medicine, but still have problems

Yikes! You're right! Shades of the Esperanto in/transitivity problem - one
of the (few) things I dislike about that language. You've got a transitive
infix "-ig-" and an intransitive infix "-igx-", yet for every verb you must
know (if both are possible) which sort it is, and then use the infix for the
other case. A classic example is "boli - intransitive, to boil", with the
transitive form being "boligi". One solution might be that an infix would
always be used for ambiguous verbs, and that's what I often do - I'd use
"boligxi" and "boligi".

A problem even with that approach is that you still have to agree on which
verbs are ambiguous. I suspect that people will agree in most cases on the
in/transitivity of a given verb - but I also suspect that there are verbs
on which people would not agree. Sometimes, perhaps, ambiguity is in the
eye of the beholder.

So we could say, ok, we *always* use the appropriate infix to indicate
in/transitivity. That could work. Though it might make the language big
and repetitious and probably ugly if you solved all your problems that way!

I see a similar problem here. Is this a cultural thing? Are there languages
that only use *different* words for something that we would call transitive
and intransitive forms? Although we use the word "boil" in both cases, I
think that "boiling something" is quite unlike "being boiled". In a way it's
kind of elegant, using a grammatical form to reduce the dictionary size, but
it also brings up these questions. Does English use Active & Passive because
we're looking at the *same* process from opposite directions? Do *I* have
trouble with this because I'm concentrating on the *opposite directions*
rather than the process? Is this a problem in Glosa...

   (The patient says "Doc, it hurts when I do this."
   and the doctor replies "Then stop doing that!".)

   (In this case I think we've talked me into choosing f. also.)

...or am I just using "METRI" incorrectly? We need might some kind of
marker to resolve situations like this.

Ja, that's the sort of thing I was thinking about. (Until we reach your left
parenthesis.) We've got the idea of a pile, and of the past, and of bigness,
all thrown together. But not of growing. Consider: "U kumu pa ma mega" or
"U kumu pa kresce ma mega".

I just try to avoid such constructions by rewriting or using proper nouns.
Why do even have pronouns? For brevity, I think.

I've always thought it strange that we have a mechanism for reflexivity
rather than for nonreflexivity. For example, if I heard "She went to her
house after school." I'd assume that "She" and "her" refer to the same
person. Even if I knew that there was more than one female involved. If
I heard "Becky went to her house after school." I'd still assume Becky=her.
That's just the simplest way of interpreting the statement.

The question arises with a statement like "She went to Becky's house after
school.". "She" might still be "Becky", but it's unusual in English to
use a pronoun and a name in this way, so that's a sign to me that "She"
is not going to her own house.

Yikes! You're right! Shades of the Esperanto in/transitivity problem - one
of the (few) things I dislike about that language. You've got a transitive
infix "-ig-" and an intransitive infix "-igx-", yet for every verb you must
know (if both are possible) which sort it is, and then use the infix for the
other case. A classic example is "boli - intransitive, to boil", with the
transitive form being "boligi". One solution might be that an infix would
always be used for ambiguous verbs, and that's what I often do - I'd use
"boligxi" and "boligi".

A problem even with that approach is that you still have to agree on which
verbs are ambiguous. I suspect that people will agree in most cases on the
in/transitivity of a given verb - but I also suspect that there are verbs
on which people would not agree. Sometimes, perhaps, ambiguity is in the
eye of the beholder.

So we could say, ok, we *always* use the appropriate infix to indicate
in/transitivity. That could work. Though it might make the language big
and repetitious and probably ugly if you solved all your problems that way!

I see a similar problem here. Is this a cultural thing? Are there languages
that only use *different* words for something that we would call transitive
and intransitive forms? Although we use the word "boil" in both cases, I
think that "boiling something" is quite unlike "being boiled". In a way it's
kind of elegant, using a grammatical form to reduce the dictionary size, but
it also brings up these questions. Does English use Active & Passive because
we're looking at the *same* process from opposite directions? Do *I* have
trouble with this because I'm concentrating on the *opposite directions*
rather than the process? Is this a problem in Glosa...

   (The patient says "Doc, it hurts when I do this."
   and the doctor replies "Then stop doing that!".)

   (In this case I think we've talked me into choosing f. also.)

...or am I just using "METRI" incorrectly? We need might some kind of
marker to resolve situations like this.

Ja, that's the sort of thing I was thinking about. (Until we reach your left
parenthesis.) We've got the idea of a pile, and of the past, and of bigness,
all thrown together. But not of growing. Consider: "U kumu pa ma mega" or
"U kumu pa kresce ma mega".

*	Bill,
What I'll do is send you the Majordomo Manual, which was all that was
posted to me by my ISP.

	I have had a go at interpreting it, and have sent a message to the
majordomo email address, which, if I understand it correctly, acts in
automatic mode if you address it using the right syntax.

	As well as sending the manual, I will append the message that I sent to
Majordomo.  It is quite amazing: I think I have got the same problem that I
had before .. "Replies" going only to the Glosalist subscriber who
originated the posting!  I simply want ALL-TO-ALL communication!!!  Maybe
my attempt at communication with the software did the trick; this is the
first time that I have consciously tried to communicate with a machine,
hoping for an interactive response.

	I sent a follow-up blip to my ISP telling him what I wanted to achieve,
and what I had done in attempting to gain the desired result: also, I sent
a "Cc:" of this blip to Paul Bartlett.   That makes two "Attachments" to
this blip.  By the way, did I tell you that I am now using Eudora Ver 3.0,
and will register it ... all to avoid being 'timed out' again.

*	Bill,
	Thank you for the immediate response to the Skribble idea.  Maybe the
Glosa version should have a more appropriate name, such as, "Skribe-La."
I thought of replying in Glosa, but the concepts involved would make this a
bit slow.

	I send the English language version of the rules; these can of course be
altered, and the translation of them into Glosa would make a nice exercise
for the Glosalist group - once a set that is suitable for a Glosa,
email-run version of the game is decided upon.  A number of things are
needed before play commences:-
A.	Rules in English, Glosa, and as many other languages as we like ...
B.	Sets of phrases, including single words and some clauses
C.	An agreed operating method for the game; i.e. sequencing, ettiquette,
means of accepting sentences, selection of phrases to be sent to players, ...
D.	Paper or electronic display of the game in play - ?

	Once the overall operation of the game is sorted out, we can introduce the
concept to Glosalist subscribers.  
	
A. As mentioned, this could be a learning experience in two ways: firstly
for Glosa-pe in translating the rules into the language of their choice;
and secondly, it would be an 'in' into Glosa for people outside the
English-language sphere (who, as Paul Bartlett has said, we are ignoring).

B. It could be a very instructive phase of the operation, just getting
people to make up sentences, and cut them up into playable bits, e.g.

	U fo alti andra pa celero greso trans u lati, risko via.

	u fo alti andra
	pa celero greso
	trans u lati, risko via

	[There probably would need to be a length limit on phrases.]

C. Making it work in practice, would probably involve a number of trial runs.
I suspect that Paul Bartlett, who uses a UNIX connection could not use an
interactive, screen-based version of the game.  I have found that my
'formatting' in email does not always get through as I had intended it.  My
only solution for Eudora was to fill the white space with dots, e.g.

*****************************************************************************
****************************** u fo alti andra ******************************
****************************** ............... ******************************
************* tri melano felis pa celero greso epi u kloro . seqe u pusi . **
************* ................ ............... ..... gramini ....... muska **
****************************** trans u lati, . ************* . pa vora.... **
****************************** ..... risko via ************* ............. **
************************************************************ plu hepta-ze  **
************************************************************ ... rubi bola **
************************************************************ plu penta ... **
************************************************************ .. riso ju-fe **
************************************************************ . pa nekto .. **
************************************************************ ............. **
************************************************************ in u mega ... **
************************************************************ .......boteka **
*****************************************************************************

	Doing this took a while.  Possibly it can be run as a separate program
with full scrolling, so that players' contributions can be fit in to an
existing layout, which is offline.  From my experience with HTML code, I
found the only thing that allowed my own formatting was the  <PRE>  tag.
But I would like to hear how you would fit /.. an ...../  /.. pa kurso ../
/ dia u parka/  / e pa vide ../ in front of  "plu penta riso ju-fe".

	Of course, the next player could use an  /... and .../ between "trans u
lati, risko via" and "dia u parka" to score five points.

D. And then there is th physical way of seeing the game.  We really did
have a sentence that stretched across the lounge-room floor - in an English
language version of the game, of course.  Without scrolling,
Skribble/Skribe-La will not work on the computer screen.  How have you
imagined the game being set out and played?

*	I'll agree with this!  A really fun Glosa game, full of impossibilities
and the unexpected, is just what a jaded world needs to give it a laugh as
well as some hope for the future.  My guess is that Aventuro would work
with Glosa if the Esperanto instructions were replaced with Glosa ones;
this would require some reverse engineering.  I have thought of trying the
same with English-language text adventure games.

In the config file, I think we need...

        # reply_to             [word] () <resend,digest>
        # Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing
        # message. If the token $SENDER is used, then the address of the
        # sender is used as the value of the reply-to header. This is the
        # value of the reply-to header for digest lists.
reply_to            = glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

...which forces the reply back to the list. While searching for more
information on the Net, I found that some prefer lists to be set up
the way we have it now. Perhaps that's why it's the default. I think
it's an old Unix prejudice; many Unix mailers have separate commands
for reply-to-sender and reply-to-group. And there are many classic
stories of embarassment caused when somebody used the wrong command!
But I'd argue that on a list, the whole idea is to treat the group as
the sender upon reply! So let's give it a whirl!

Hopefully we can get this nailed down today. I'll login periodically
today to check for place-responde messages!

I'd like to use email attachments or ftp. Definitely ftp eventually, if not
sooner, like now! Yes, the program or zipfile would require binary transfer.
Some ftp programs require the user to select the transfer mode; some detect
it automatically (although they often seem to guess wrong!); browsers
usually seem to handle things properly.

If ftp is ok for you, I'll put those files on my site today! pkzipped?

But also see my comments below concerning permission...

Currently, the programs use plain old ASCII textfiles for their input, and
these could be used just like Paul's reference. For distribution without
permission I'll need to encrypt datafiles and/or embed the data inside the
program.

1) Do you have PKZIP?

2) Do you have Windows 3.1, 3.11 or 95?
   (The Windows version should work on any of these.)

3) Do you have VBRUN100.DLL in \WINDOWS or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM?
   (Either directory should work.)

Ja, that's the *only* way to to tell Browsers to keep their hands off.
For anything outside a Preformatted Text block, browsers collapse whitespace
and insert newlines wherever necessary. According to the HTML specs, browsers
are free to interpret HTML in any (reasonable) way that they wish, so you
can't really get too fancy if you want portability. There's no way to really
know how the page will appear for all browsers. For example, the <H1>
through <H6> tags for Headers. The only requirement is that <H1> be more
distinctive than <H2>, <H2> than <H3>, etc. Excellent for portability, but
if you're picky about the way your page looks, you're going to have trouble.
Most browsers use a large font for <H1>, a smaller font for <H2>, etc., but
they can use different fonts, or colors, or shades of gray, or italics.

Last weekend I stumbled upon an Adventure site that had links to others,
and just as I can get lost in a library or a bookstore and now on the Net,
I ended up spending hours over the past week exploring the current state
of Adventure Games - or "Interactive Fiction" as it now seems to be called,
though it'll always be Adventure Games to me; and IF also includes some
graphical games too so it's not necessarily exclusively Text Adventure.

See http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/xyzzy.htm for some of my findings.

There's a lot of source code out there, public domain. For example, the
original Adventure exists in many different forms and languages. Perhaps
we could add Glosa. Also of interest is that there's some good free
development software out there - I've been investigating INFORM and HUGO -
and these seem quite suitable for what we have in mind. These development
tools even come with source code, so we can really dig into them if there's
any translation problems, though they appear to be sufficiently configurable
to handle such things anyway.

- Later - Bill

*	Somehow, I feel that in Glosa less is better.

	Where it seems necessary to specify exactly who is diong what, Glosa
allows this:-

	Fe pa bate u pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate u pedi.
	Fe pa bate-se epi u pedi.
	Fe pa bate fe pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate fe pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate-se epi fe pedi.  [Possibly a little redundant]
	U gina pa bate u pedi.
	U gina pa bate-se epi fe pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe pedi.
	U gina auto pa bate fe pedi.
	U gina auto pa bate-se epi fe pedi.  [Over-redundant again?]
	Fe pa bate fe auto pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe auto pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe epi fe pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe epi fe auto pedi.

So, take your pick.  Some of the above are ambiguous, while some are
redundant.
But, in context, you will probably know who is hitting whom.

	I will put in Bill Patterson's comment about it being better to avoid
undue reflexivity if meaning does not call for it.

BP>
I've always thought it strange that we have a mechanism for reflexivity
rather than for nonreflexivity. For example, if I heard "She went to her
house after school." I'd assume that "She" and "her" refer to the same
person. Even if I knew that there was more than one female involved. If
I heard "Becky went to her house after school." I'd still assume Becky=her.***
That's just the simplest way of interpreting the statement.

The question arises with a statement like "She went to Becky's house after###
school.". "She" might still be "Becky", but it's unusual in English to
use a pronoun and a name in this way, so that's a sign to me that "She"
is not going to her own house.
END<
*	I would agrre with Bill, that English works in the ways marked *** and
###, and I feel that there is no reason that Glosa should not act in this
way, also.

Saluta,
 Robin

*	I'd rather not invent a marker for either active or passive in Glosa.  
The authors are firmly in favour of everything being in the Active Voice;
and, the Passive form   ~gene ge-X~  = "got Xed"  is relatively new in Glosa.

But transitivity is different, and some concepts do allow both usages,
while many actions either act on something or they don't.  In Glosa, it is
supposed that a combination of syntax and context will sort out whether we
will have a direct object or not.  EG  Id pa pluvi.
		Q. Qe, id pa pluvi qod?  R. Asura, id pa pluvi hidra!

** METRI
As a substantive, this word can function as thing, action or modifier.  So,
somewhere, possibly in our brains, there is a 'centre of measuringness':
one exploration of semantics involves the attempt to use a word in as many
different functional ways as possible; in how many ways can we express the
concept of "measuring" using this word?  After trying ten, or so, ways, we
will probably reach the logical limit of the lexical item ~metri~.

>> *	Presently, I am working on the principle that SVO sentences have verbs.
>> 	~U kumu pa mega.~ feels like "The heap bigged." (grew itself bigger)
>
>Ja, that's the sort of thing I was thinking about. (Until we reach your left
>parenthesis.) We've got the idea of a pile, and of the past, and of bigness,
>all thrown together. But not of growing. Consider: "U kumu pa ma mega" or
>"U kumu pa kresce ma mega".
>
*	Id say that one of the unwritten rules of Linguistics is involved here.
In the same way that if you wear a suit, you can always 'dress down' by
taking off your jacket, and even your tie, thus, with communication you can
use all of the function words to ensure full understanding, or you can
'elide' and drop out the words that you think are unnecessary.

	No-one will complain that your mode of speech is a little verbose, if
they understand well everything you say; however, people will complain, or
worse, stop listening, if the brevity of your utterance causes them pain in
the process of trying to understand what you are saying.

	In ~U kumupa pa ma mega.~ something definitely seems to be missing, and
one can put the short sentence through the brain a number of times in
trying to find the sense in it, running through different possible actions
in attempting to relate the heap to its size: this hunting for meaning can
cause actual pain.

[[[[[ Until I sort out the "Respond_to:"  switch for the Glosalist, I would

	Even if they are altruists, I think they might have given one or two
examples of what to do to alter a few key items of configuration.  And, yes
the "spokes of a wheel" pattern has been the acknowleged best communication

	Great News that you were able to adjust the file without much trouble.

	There are many ways to express this:  what is the time?, how late is

Hi friends,
	I hope to see more attempts at using Glosa, but wish to get this list
running because it serves its subscribers.

	Hence, I write this message in English, to encourage English language
responses.  Please send in questions about Glosa ... writing in English.  I
will of course give English language translations of any Glosa that I use
on this list.

To Recap.

Glosa uses the unadorned Roman script.
Its vocab. is from Greek and Latin roots.
The pronunciation is with Italian vowels and generalised European
consonants (one letter has one sounding).
The sentence construction uses the logical pattern of English (phrases
are "head final" with the main concept word after the modifiers).

Why did the dog cross the road?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
U kanis transiti u via.		[The dog crosses the road.]

U bruno kanis pa transiti u lati via. [The brown dog crossed the wide

    One remark one sometimes (often?) reads about Glosa is that it is
just relexified English -- merely English with funny words substituted
almost one-for-one.  In which case, why learn Glosa?  Why not just
learn English?  Although the charge of relexification may not be
strictly true in absolutely every instance, many of the samples of
Glosa that I have seen seem to give some credence to the charge.

    One example of this is overuse of tense and mood markers in Glosa
to ape English usage.  If tense or mood is clear, then why mark it?  If
a clause indicates past time, why redundantly mark it in every clause
if the time reference does not change?  If Glosa is merely English
with other words substituted, then what value does it have when with a
little more effort, somebody could have the "real thing"?  Are there
any users of Glosa who do *NOT* know English (not necessarily on this
list)?  If so, how do they use markers?

Subject: What is Good Syntax?
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Fri, 07 Nov 97 18:5

Saluta a vi de u Glosalist.

	In English again, sorry.

	What is good syntax?  Is this question important in English and/or Glosa?

	Do speakers of English automatically know what is good syntax - by virtue
of having learnt English?  Or is the use of syntax something that is
hard-wired into our brains anyway, and, if so, does this mean that the
syntax we use is, by definition, automatically good?

	It has been stated that Glosa has no morphological grammar (no
part-of-speech markers, verb inflections or noun mood markers), and this
has been oversimplified by the Glosa authors to saying Glosa has "no
grammar," which, to the linguistically educated, is like waving a red rag
to a bull.
	It has been stated, by me, that Glosa has "syntax-based" grammar. But is
there truth in this?  To the literate speaker of a national language, Glosa
could really appear to have no grammar; and, for those who wish to begin
writing Glosa, there is sometimes trouble in knowing where to start. 

	So, the question remains: if Glosa is a real language, and there fore has
a grammar, where does this grammar reside?
	If, as the authors say, it is in the ordering of the words, then is it
possible for people to use Glosa with either good or bad grammar?
Is Glosa with bad grammar Glosa that has bad syntax; and, obversely,is
Glosa with good grammar Glosa that has good syntax?

	The question is circular.  But, please ponder the concept of syntax.
Because, if syntax cannot be pondered upon, Glosa is lost.

	The Chinese learn a language with no morphological grammar (characters,
like words in Glosa, do not change for reasons of grammar).
They pick up the tricks of the trade by learning classical Chinese poetry
by rote, and in their brains, the whole syntactical system kicks into gear.

	Perhaps Glosa could be taught similarly, but I feel that adults can't just
soak up the Glosa word order system simply by reading "Plu Glosa Nota."
	Children can learn Glosa by reading Children's stories in Glosa, but
adults are past that stage in their neural development, and most adults
need to approach language-learning from a rule-based direction.

	And, to get back to the original question: is there such a thing as good
syntax; and, if there is such a thing, can it be defined in relation to
Glosa; and, if so, can it be identified and taught to adult learners?

	Please let us hear your ideas on this.  It is certainly no use for me to
go on, and on, about the syntax of Glosa if this is seen as a hollow
concept by those who might learn and use the language.

	What does the panel think!?  Are there any questions?

Saluta,
 Robin
	P.S. Of course I have opinions on the matter, but will add the next
chapter after reading your responses to this one.

 . Good syntax in English is good syntax ... why not use it in Glosa?
 . There is a lot of bad English about: Glosa does not ape these errors.
 As I have tried to say, before: well-written Glosa translates, almost
word for word, into English, but we can't say the reverse of this is     true.
 . There is legal, correct English with all the "I's" dotted and "T's"
crossed.  Then there is the highly "elided" back-fence variety (with many
function words missing). 
	x The Glosa authors have, on occasion, pointed to a more 'vernacular' form
of Glosa - describing it as "telegramatic."
	x Paul feels that punctilious use of tense particles, for instance, makes
the language stodgey and unnecessarily wordy, so that omitting them, when
the time implied is fully understood, would give a more rational form.
	x I have erred on the school-book side of the balance ... knowing that it
is very much easier for learners to drop (elide) assumable function words,
than it is to learn to use them later, when their presence becomes
necessary.  I feel that having learners start with the abbreviated form of
Glosa puts them at a disadvantage, later.

	This theory about learning the full or abbreviated form of a language can
be bourne out through psychological and educational reasoning, but this
does not prove it is true.  The pattern I see as working best involves the
teaching of full grammar first, then having students gradually drop the
redundant words as they gain a feel for the language.

	Paul corrected none of the examples I gave, so I will attempt an
abbreviation, myself:-

   I gave the sentence:
Qe, u celero rubi vagona pa pasa u mega bruno kanis tem id pa du transiti u
via?

   It could have been:
Qe, u celero rubi vagona pa pasa u mega bruno kanis tem id du transiti u via?

   Does the second sentence still mean:
	[Did the fast red car pass the large brown dog while it was crossing the
road?]

	Please comment.  Which would you feel more comfortable learning? Which
feels more "natural" (with all the psychological loadings that that word
carries)? 
	Paul's answer is fairly clear:-
>    One example of this is overuse of tense and mood markers in Glosa
>to ape English usage.  If tense or mood is clear, then why mark it?  If
>a clause indicates past time, why redundantly mark it in every clause
>if the time reference does not change? 
	____________________________________

	Paul's other criticism is possibly more crucial.  

>	[  ......  ]   If Glosa is merely English
>with other words substituted, then what value does it have when with a
>little more effort, somebody could have the "real thing"? 

... and especially ... > Are there
>any users of Glosa who do *NOT* know English (not necessarily on this
>list)?  If so, how do they use markers?

	How do the Glosa authors get feedback, about Glosa, from people who are
not English-speakers?  Clark, Ashby and I all have English as our first
Language (L1); I am not fluent in other national languages, but Clark and
Ashby are.

	Glosa dictionaries exist in German, French, Spanish, Swahili and Chinese,
so there should be non-speakers -of-English with whom I can communicate in
Glosa.

	Paul also feels that Glosa info should be written out in other languages -
to introduce the concept to people outside of the English-speaking
community.  I agree, and if I knew how to publish them to their intended
audience, would ask the Glosa authors to prepare such translations.

	Please make your suggestions on how we might overcome the English-language
barrier.

Saluta,
 Robin

I heard this constantly when I first began to put Speedwords on the web. It is only
relexified English. My response was, a Spaniard, or a German would say the same thing.
It is relexified Spanish, etc. And, in fact, it seems to me, from one perspective,
Spanish is nothing but relexified English, that is, just substituting one word of
Spanish for one word of English and or vice versa. So is German, French, Dutch,
Japanese, Russian, etc. Although I may be looking at this too simplistically, I do not
see this as an argument against Glosa or Speedwords. If we use Spanish as an example
with a simple sentence, then what is the difference?

Mi amigo es Miguel.
My friend is Miguel.

Looks like the same argument to me.

However, what if we do this?
Mi amigo es Miguel.
Ji ar e Miguel.

Well, based on Paul's argument, and others, why, Speedwords is nothing more than
relexified Spanish, to the Spaniard, and relexified English to the English speaker.

How about this?

Miguel tiene el libro de mi.
Miguel ha l bu d j.
Miguel ha ji bu.
Miguel has the book of me.
Miguel has my book.
Either version of Speedwords, or English, is understandable to the reader who knows
them, and either way, the correct meaning is transferred, which is what an auxiliary
language should do, or the learning of another natlang should do.One translation
follows the Spanish "de mi" and the other follows the English equivalent "my book".

All language, to me, seems to be one form or another of "relexification". And, right
or wrong, I look at such an argument as a strawdog. It is a tool to help each
individual bolster their reason not to learn a specific language. In reality, they
prefer another one more than likely, and this is a way to add weight to the decision.
In Paul's case this may not be true, but then again, I often make a final decision
based on what someone else considers a non-argument.

A friend of mine said one could not use Speedwords in this context. A Japanese could
not write Speedwords as a shorthand system for Japanese and have a Russian who knew
Speedwords understand it. So, I put together some sentences and asked the friend to
translate them. He did, and so did some others. Their response was, it appeared
different than what they expected Speedwords to do, but they did translate correctly
and understood the translation. After the fact I told them I had used Speedwords to
translate in Japanese word order, word for word. Point, it worked, Speedwords worked
when it was not supposed to work. Although I did not have a Russian to work with, I
did have an English speaker and a Portuguese speaker and a Chinese speaker, one of my
T'ai Chi students.

My point is this. From what I have seen of Glossa, although I am not fluent in it, or
even a real beginner yet, I believe it will and does work just as well. Hogben wrote
in his Interglosa book that linguists often did not know what actually worked for the
rank and file, [my paraphrase from memory] but only what should work for the
"educated" linguist not dealing with the real world of language speakers, i.e. the
ordinary average barely educated person to the educated. So, it appears to me that
these questions are interesting to speculate upon, but in reality have nothing to do
with real world usage.
I have studied Russian, Spanish, Koine Greek, Speedwords, some French, Japanese when
living in Japan, a touch of Hebrew, and beginning, along with my daughter, to look
into Chinese more indepth. Seems like they all could be a "strange" form of
"relexified" English to me. Depends on how I would want to argue the case. Yet, the
Russian, etc. would say I don't know what I'm talking about. Their language is not
English.

I would suspect it is more important to actually use the language Glosa, or whatever,
versus argue why it won't work or is not needed because it is "relexified" whatever.
Bumble bees can't fly according to the scientist, yet the Bumblebee doesn't seem to
pay atterntion to what they say it can't do. So it is with Speedwords, and Glosa, from
what I see at my level of experience and usage. All the things I heard Speedwords
can't do, it does do, and I suspect the same is true of Glosa. The way to find out is
to use it.

Hope all is well with everyone on the list.

Al l sue,
Bob

    I will respond here to just a few excerpts from both of Robin's
recent posts on Glosalist.  I do not take issue with everything.

On Fri, 7 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

    Can we even meaningfully speak of "good syntax" apart from any
particular language?  I honestly do not know.  There may be Chomskyan
types who believe in some sort of deep grammar which includes syntax. 
However, I think it would be more practical to skip such high-blown
talk and merely deal with Glosa on an immediate, practical level.

    See above.  I think we need to get practical.  I think Robin's
one-time grammar statement was very useful, although I differed on a
couple of details, as I recall.  I think something like this should be
pursued, as long as Ashby&Clark don't try to pull a Schleyer on people.

    Definitely.  Personally I think this was a blunder on the part of
the principals.  Even to some of us who are not professional linguists
or polyglots (or polymaths :-) ), it was/is a ridiculous statement.

    If we come up with an effective propaedeutic, do we even need to
answer this question?

    And here I had always assumed that Chinese children learned their
native language from their elders, the way other children do. :-)  I did
not learn English from the cradle by reciting Shakespeare and Milton.

    I haven't even seen a copy of "Plu Glosa Nota" in a couple of
years.  However, this is precisely my objection to the "Mechanics of
Glosa" approach.  It consists of paradigmatic sentences divorced from
context.  Children do not learn their mother tongues from a grammar
book.  But neither do they learn outside of an environment.  They learn
with all sorts of verbal feedback and non-verbal cues from their
elders.  This feedback is missing from the "Mechanics of Glosa."  That
is why I disagree with the principals and think that a language
description is crucial.

   Personally I don't even think the question needs to be answered.
 

On Sun, 9 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

    Fair enough.  But why English?  Why not the syntax of some other
language?  I am not saying Glosa should _not_ use English syntax (more
or less, because English does retain a few residual inflections which
Glosa does not have).  I just think we need to make our assumptions
clear.

    Yes, but I think this is unwise on the whole.  It seems to mimic
elliptical, colloquial English.  A Glosa-speaker who does not know
English could be thrown off by this style.  As I understand it, the
purpose of Glosa is to facilitate communication, not to baffle.

    I am primarily saying that we should take into consideration various
speech habits of non-Indo-European languages.  Do they have anything to
teach us?

    Actually, I think the sentence would be just as clear even without
the 'du' in the second clause.

    What "feels more 'natural'" may be so conditioned by our native
speech habits that I think the concept is more or less meaningless.

    This last clause is crucial.  It the time reference _does_ change,
or if the aspect (which English marks confusingly) is critical, then by
all means mark them.  In the example sentence, the time reference does
not change and the aspect in the subordinate clause is not critical.

    This one I really don't know.  When Volapük and Esperanto were
published, "modern" communications consisted of surface mail and the
electric telegraph.  I don't even recall whether undersea cables had
been laid yet (1887 for Esperanto).  And yet they went further, faster,
than most recent auxiliary language projects.  I really don't know why.

    What do I think Glosa really needs?

1)  A language description intelligible to average people regarding
usage.  It does not have to be in a format that would thrill a
professional linguist: just make it practical and unambiguous.  (Robin,
do you still have your proposed grammar statement you sent me a year or
two ago?  I can't seem to find a copy.)

2)  A SETTLED core vocabulary.  "Glosa 1000" does not exist in a
settled form, as I have remarked many times before.  At the same time,
I think that Glosa 6000 is overkill.  Lists such as Essential World
English, the Longman Definig Dictionary (I think it's called), and the
Universal Language Dictionary would seem to indicate that a base
vocabulary of 1500 - 2000 *judiciously* selected words (apart from
proper names and specialist terminology) would be adequate.  I honestly
don't know how the current Glosa wordlists were selected.  But if we
use too large a vocabulary, we partially cut the ground from under the
attempt to make the language more or less easily learnable by adult
users.

3)  Dispersion.  And I admit that this one stumps me.  There is also
the issue of not "dialectizing" Glosa between Internet and non-Internet
users.  (A&C are not even part of this discussion, but they do hold
copyrights.  I just hope they would not try to pull a Schleyer.)

    For use by artificial language authors, I have combined the
vocabularies of Basic English, Essential World English, and the Longman
Defining Vocabulary into a single, alphabetized file.  The combined
vocabulary consists (in English) of 9 prefixes, 41 suffixes, and 2717
words (including a few phrases).  It is available by ftp at

ftp://ftp.access.digex.net/pub/access/pobart/base.vocabulary

I did the combining by use of computer utilities, so there may be a 
few inconsistencies.  As always, you use at your own risk.  Because of
format differences, it was not convenient to include Richard Harrison's
Universal Language Dictionary.

    A short time ago I cross posted to the Glosalist a reference to
a combined vocabulary list drawn from several resources.  I was not
implying that a basic Glosa vocabulary need to have all 2700+ words 
of this combined list.  It just needs to be able to express things.  
The combined list is just intended to be a starting resource.

Nicely done, Paul! I'm already using it in two ways:

   To find out what words are missing in Glosa 6000.

   To construct a Glosa Core Vocabulary, as you once suggested,
   by removing words from the Basic Dictionary that aren't also
   found in the Artificial Languages Base Vocabulary.

I'm still calling the dictionaries the 6000 Series and the 1000 Series,
though it looks like they're going to be closer to 7500 and 2500 words.
Perhaps I'll just leave the names alone, have it be one of those "For
Historical Reasons" kind of things. On the other hand, calling them
Glosa 7000 and Glosa 2500 would distinguish them from the others. But
first I'll wait until I can make a better estimate.

A new page, also accessible from my main Glosa page, shows the words
which are in the Artificial Languages Base Vocabulary but not in
Glosa 6000...

http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/omission.htm

Also, the other two pages and the dictionary files have been updated.

Has anybody had trouble downloading those selfextracting dictionary
files? My browser doesn't seem to want to download executables via
ftp. It downloads other binary files - just plain zipfiles for example.

    As I have mentioned in Glosa circles, I think that Glosa 6000 is
overkill for Glosa's purposes but that "Glosa 1000" does not exist in 
a consistent manner in Glosa Education Organization publications and
may be inadequate.  I suspect that a roughly 2000-word vocabulary would
be better.

    Four days ago I posted the above notice.  Since then it has been
pointed out to me that there appear to be a few errors in the file.  
I have corrected some of the manifest errors.  However, the following
words occur as such in one of the source files, and it is not
immediately obvious in context what the intended words are, although
some guessing may be in order:

bup
getween
sib
slef

As before, you use this information "at your own risk."

Paul,Another thanks for the list. I have the EWE book, and Basic, but not the
Longman Defining Vocab. What is the story with the Longman vocabulary?

You have saved me some time as I was working on a similar project. However, I
was also going to "adjust" the list you have done by comparing it with the
Pitman 700, the Gregg 500, the Silverberg 422, and other "most frequently
used word" studies.

Speaking of Basic's vocabulary. There was a "minimised" list of the 850 words
to a 600 word list. Finally found the list. Originally it was mentioned in a
book on Basic's vocabulary but someone had torn the page out with the 600
list. Turns out it was in another book by Ogden that I had just bought.
"Opposition."

I think it is a valid and important point to build IAL vocabularies on
studies like the above. IMO vocabularies should be based on frequency of
daily use, universally accepted words, words of similar spelling sound and
meaning in multiple languages, etc. And, a small highly functional vocabulary
that would expand through experience and actual usage.

Anyway, thanks again for the list and effort to do it.

Al l sue,
Bob

I know of its existence but somehow I've still not quite got
around to ordering it, along with some of the other materials
that I'd like to have. You mention one cassette; are there more?
One thing I'd like to see, and which Robin may be providing, is
a large number of cassettes, so that I can immerse myself in the
sounds.

Hmmmm. I did a wordcount tonight, and was surprised to find that my
current Glosa-English 6000 source file contains 5989 Glosa entries.
Not bad! Some of those are compounds (lowering the count), and I'll
be adding a few new ones (raising the count), so it will probably end
up not too far from 6000 unique words.

*	Since sending this, Bill Patterson has placed the list in his Webpages
- ready for printing.  Also he has listed the 'synonyms' that he has not
been able to decide upon, asking for a group-think on the matter. 

	Bill has located the work in the two following locations:-
   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm
   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/synonyms.htm

He has also used a password to get into  /glosa.htm  and this is 
   [not here anymore because this file is now public]

	Actually, the plot thickens: I had the "Glosa 1000" list and the "Glosa
6000" list in two parts of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.  So, laboriously, I
compiled a single, all-encompassing list by collapsing both lists together.

	After that, I decided that it would be best if we had the related
English-to-Glosa list equivalent to this newly compiled "Glosa 6000+" list.

	So, I used Galaxy, my trusty ASCII word processor, and DOS's LIST.EXE to
''reverse'' the list, so that
	A(D) at,towards

produced the obverse listings
	at A(D)  and
	towards A(D)

So, as you can guess, with alternative English words and phrases the list
grew.

But what was not expected was the plethora of Classical synonyms that
turned up for many English words.  I was led to believe that there might
legitemately be 
a Latin and a Greek word for one English word, EG
	water AQA, HIDRA

but some English words yielded five, six or seven 'synonyms.'  This created
a  real problem for me in something that I had expected to be straightforward.

	Our thinking was that there might be (at least) three levels of the _Glosa
6000_ dictionary:-
	. A _Learner's Dictionary_ in which only one Glosa word is given for each
English Language word - no synonyms;
	. A _Standard Dictionary_ in which a suitable single synonym would be
given for commonly-used words, e.g. aqa and hidra for water.
	. A _Literary Dictionary_ in which all possible alternative are listed,
with probably one preferred usage and a likely synonym indicated, followed
by the alternative possible forms.  Note: if there was a synonym in both
Latin and Ancient Greek, that means an English-language word generates at
least four Classical equivalents!

	This might explain why it is a 'work in progress.'  Bill Patterson has
been silent for a few months, while he worked on sorting out the good
synonyms from the bad ones.  He has now asked for help with refiining the
difficult cases.

	I would like to see a _First Glosa Dictionary_ that did give one
Classical word as the preferred Glosa usage, but which might, for some
words, indicate a second Classical word as the synonym.  This would allow
some literary freedom from the start, and avoid the need for making
possibly unnecessary choices between two likely words ... allowing the
second choice to be listed in the synonym position.  
	Paul Bartlett, prefers, however, to avoid any possible confusion by
keeping, in the first instance, to a single Glosa word for each English
lexeme.
	I have just started writing again to the Glosa-pe in Uganda.  This matter
of the dictionary preferences of beginners is one question I must ask.

	Very soon I will download Bill Patterson's work on this, and am keen to
see what he has decided to be the best constitution for a Beginner's
Dictionary.

	Jay, please try Glosa by translating something yourself, or telling a
story in your own (Glosa) words.  This was what Bill Patterson did to test
the language: he chose to attempt translation of "The Wolf" into Glosa, and
did, I feel, discover that Glosa was up to the job.

Saluta,
 Robin

I really do want to see what you have done, Bill.
	So, by adding and subtracting, you have come back to the first number the
Glosa authors thought of: 6000.

	We still have the basic wordlist from Paul Bartlett, who is firmly
convinced that 2500 words would be adequate and a reasonable learning load,
while claiming that 6000 words represents some form of linguistic over-kill.

	How might we, in Glosa, deduce the right number, and selection, of words
for a First Dictionary that would be suitable for use in all cultures?

	Perhaps there is no alternative to actual field trials with test
populations.  This is where I came in.  I was writing letters to Africans
and other Third Worlders ... and I wondered how I could release more
dictionaries, in the field, without actually going broke.  The question
still remains: the thinner the starter dictionary the lower the costs in
paper and postage.  So there is a pragmatic reason for finding the minimum
starter dictionary, as well as a linguistic one!

	My first thought was to ship the S/H luggable computer, I bought for A$80,
to my friends in Uganda, following this with a simple printer, then feeding
them with paper and printer ribbons.  This was a brilliant idea for cutting
down on air postage costs, but was knocked out by import duties into
Uganda.  The computer and a A$50 S/H printer would have clocked up an
import bill of around US$1000.  And I was advised not to travel personally
to Uganda with the items in my luggage, because this would end in my being
gaoled as a smuggler.

	So, unless anyone can get to a Ugandan embassy to collect the papers for
application as a Non-Governmental Organisation, exempt from import duty, it
looks like thinner dictionaries is the way to go.

	Back to the drawing board?  Any ideas?

Saluta,
 Robin

I've been hitting the synonyms pretty hard this weekend (and some of
the omissions) because I really want to wrap those up before I print
out another copy of the dictionaries. Then I'll hit the Omissions List.
That's where we can be really creative; invent your own Glosa word!
After, of course, making sure that the English word is rightfully on
the Omissions List, and searching the dictionary for similar words,
etc.

Just to clarify: the password is on the downloadable dictionary files.
And I've been updating those daily, and will be for the next few days
until I finish the synonyms.

It wasn't so much the synonyms that bothered me. The *homonyms* were
what bogged me down for a while! That was very slow going and after
an evening of dehomonymizing, I usually lacked either the time or
the motivation to hit it again. But now I'm making some rapid progress.
I ended up with a single Glosa-English source file (GE6000S.TXT), with
each record being of the form GLOSAWORD = ENGLISHWORD (or phrase, as
the case may be). Preferred synonyms are marked with a leading *. Then
I wrote procedures that read this source file and arrange the synonyms
according to the splats (stars (*)) and remove the splats (stars (*))
and swap and sort and create all of the dictionaries and zipfiles and
synonyms and omissions files. So after making changes to the source
file, all I need to do is enter 'make all' and sit back for a few
minutes and then upload the results.

I hope to be getting back to "U Lupus" by next week. Unfortunately a
business trip within the next few weeks is a definite possibility. So
I may be delayed. Oh, well.

Well, nothing too fancy. That one's just a singleword-to-singleword
mapping, the Literary Dictionary with the extra synonyms removed.

Robin, I think your computer's clock needs resetting. :-)

    I hope I made it clear in my follow-up that I do *not* think that
there needs to be a one-for-one correspondence between the list I
posted and a basic Glosa vocabulary.  Therefore, if the list has
approximately X number of words, that does not mean that the basic
vocabulary also must have X number of words.  The question becomes, 
Can the basic vocabulary express what the list expresses, however 
many words the basic vocabulary needs to do that?

    The Longman Defining Vocabulary contains about 2250 English words,
Supposedly, in terms of these words any other English word can be
(eventually) defined.  Now it could be that some Glosa basic words may
not correspond precisely to any single Longman word.  After all,
nothing says that Glosa (or any other IAL) *has* to be nothing more
than a relexification of English (or any other natlang).

    Those times that I have tried to write Glosa using the list of
roughly 1600 words I collated from different supposedly "Glosa 1000"
lists, I sometimes found myself jumping through mental hoops trying to
express what I wanted to say.  That is why my estimate for a basic
vocabulary is in the 2000 - 2500 range.  However, it is true that
greater familiarity and use may make expression easier with a given
base vocabulary.  I confess that I have not actually used Glosa all
that much.  Since I did collate the basic reference from actual G.E.O.
"Glosa 1000" publications, that is what I tried to use.

    On the other hand, if actual use shows need for a few more words
than the collated list, then if they are available from Glosa 6000, all
the better.  But I still maintain that Glosa 6000 is overkill.

    In my mind it comes down in part to the intended use for the
language.  Zamenhof originally published Esperanto with basic
communication in mind, so far as I know, and the original set of roots
was in the 800 - 900 range, together with the lexical affixes to extend
their use.  Subsequently, a number of users tried to use Esperanto
considerably for belles lettres, and they started using a lot more
words, and using more words in different ways that are not always
apparent to new learners.  I am not saying that they were wrong.  But
it seems to me that some Esperantists have gotten away from the
language's original intent to easing international, intercultural
communications.

    Some have argued that belletristic use of Esperanto has helped keep
it going.  That may be.  But that argument immediately brings up the
question in my mind whether the language (or any IAL) would have
survived for its original intent.  I once exchanged two letters in
Glosa with a man in China.  We needed a basic vocabulary to
communicate, not one to produce literature to win the Nobel Prize.

    The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof of an
auxiliary language is in the using.  By the way, does anyone know if
Ashby&Clark are even aware of this Internet activity and whether they
might try to cause problems with copyright?  (Before I put up the Glosa
web pages, I went to the trouble to get their explicit permission and
to attach their copyright.)

Excussssse me???? RLR IS ALSO A  SHORTHAND SYSTEM that can be used for
shortening email, or any printed matter. It is only an AUXLANG when the
international language principles are used. I was, as I said in a previous
post, going to begin writing ALL my email with the 26 RLR words and the &.
This is the flexibility of Speedwords. Even on the auxlang I am not using
RLR as an auxlang. Just read Ray's last question about why I used the word
"that" the way I did. I already have a discussion list where I use RLR
fully as an auxlang and only those wanting to do so with me must sign up
for the list. If this is such an offense to you I will be glad to
discontinue using it as a shorthand system for Paul's sake, on this list.
Is there not a topic on any of these lists about languages where someone is
not offended over every little thing?

Al l sue,
Bob

P.S. In most cases I always close with Al l sue, no matter what the list
is. Hope that doesn't offend anyone. Sometimes I use Mil gra.

Ashby and Clark, and found them to be delightful and straightforward.  A

		I'm really not at all sure.  From A&C I learned that he gave them the 
go-ahead to make what changes they wanted, but I thought that much got 
lost in the process.  For example, the ingenious verb system, though 
difficult at first, is really simple and can work after a while spent 
learning it.  It is central to Ig, and Glosa is very much different 
because of the changes.  They are more than a simplification, though.

		I can't say.  It's my impression that he dropped it 
(during the war), even though it apparently did arouse some interest in 
Britain, at least.  Perhaps he tired of it or thought better of it.  To 
many it might seem very complex (a false impression).  I have seen 
criticisms of it that claim he is not a linguist (but then, Zamenhof, 
A&C, and Petry never claimed to be, either. :) )

>what
> principles of Interglossa does Glosa use, or is it an entire "rewrite"? 
		Many principles are the same:  no accidence (which is 
really what A&C mean when they say "no grammar" (i.e., no changes in 
words for grammatical meaning); use of Graeco-Latin word bases (though G 
changes spellings); word-order and small particles to mark syntax.  The 
most significant change is the loss of Ig's verb system (which I think is 
a loss of some magnitude).  It is thus only a partial, but 
author-endorsed "rewrite."

> Hope these are appropriate questions.
		They are, indeed, and I am interested in your impression of 
these attempts at answers and your reaction to both Ig and G.

None taken. Funny though, I though we were students of language. And, I
have not had one such comment like these from people I send email to who
are not on any language list at all, just exchanging messages with me on
business or personal matters. The only place I have received any comments
like these are on language related lists???

I do not wish to have this reply be misconstrued. This is not trying to
justify anything, it is not to create an argument, nor is it to continue a
thread. That would not be appropriate for the Glosa list. Therefore, I
will only respond to this thread further if it comes in private email to
me.

I would appreciate more use of the Glosa by Robin, Paul and others who may
know it more, so I can begin to absorb more of it. And, I won't post again
to this list until I can begin writing something in Glosa myself. Nor will
I use RLR here for the shorthand or the aux part of it.

Mil gra,
Bob

I've been hitting the synonyms pretty hard this weekend (and some of
the omissions) because I really want to wrap those up before I print
out another copy of the dictionaries. Then I'll hit the Omissions List.
That's where we can be really creative; invent your own Glosa word!
After, of course, making sure that the English word is rightfully on
the Omissions List, and searching the dictionary for similar words,
etc.

Just to clarify: the password is on the downloadable dictionary files.
And I've been updating those daily, and will be for the next few days
until I finish the synonyms.

It wasn't so much the synonyms that bothered me. The *homonyms* were
what bogged me down for a while! That was very slow going and after
an evening of dehomonymizing, I usually lacked either the time or
the motivation to hit it again. But now I'm making some rapid progress.
I ended up with a single Glosa-English source file (GE6000S.TXT), with
each record being of the form GLOSAWORD = ENGLISHWORD (or phrase, as
the case may be). Preferred synonyms are marked with a leading *. Then
I wrote procedures that read this source file and arrange the synonyms
according to the splats (stars (*)) and remove the splats (stars (*))
and swap and sort and create all of the dictionaries and zipfiles and
synonyms and omissions files. So after making changes to the source
file, all I need to do is enter 'make all' and sit back for a few
minutes and then upload the results.

I hope to be getting back to "U Lupus" by next week. Unfortunately a
business trip within the next few weeks is a definite possibility. So
I may be delayed. Oh, well.

Well, nothing too fancy. That one's just a singleword-to-singleword
mapping, the Literary Dictionary with the extra synonyms removed.

> Why did Interglossa never progress much?

    Probably we can only speculate.  Interglossa came out _during_ the
Second World War when, shall we say, people had other things on their
minds.  Then, after the war, Britain had a lot of rebuilding to do.  I
don't know if it was ever published as such in other English speaking
countries or whether copies were merely exported to them.  Also, I
myself have found the style of the book a little hard to follow.  (Of
course, others may not.)

    Certainly, the changes fromn Interglossa were due to Ashby and
Clark.  As to *why* they made the changes they did, I don't know, never
having met them or inquired by mail.  But it seems to me as if they
kept some -- not all -- the language but sort of missed its spirit. 
That's why I think that both languages had a lot of possibility but
that Glosa was not entirely well done.  However, I think it is still
salvageable.

    I suppose you meant "Glosa" here.  I really don't know, as Hogben
died over twenty(?) years ago.

    I wonder how much Clark and Asbhy actually tried using Interglossa
themselves.  As John Schilke pointed out, the Interglossa verb system
might take a little getting used to, but I think it was a fascinating
idea.  In fact, when I was playing around with a project I called
frater2, I more or less imported Hogben's verb system wholesale with
the addition of one verb (relating to mental/spiritual activity).  I
speculate that Interglossa never really got a good field trial.

    I wouldn't call Glosa a complete rewrite, but I do consider them
separate languages in the sense that Esperanto and Ido are separate
languages.

    Entirely appropriate, I would say.  I have wondered some of these
same things myself, as probably have others.

OK.  Thanks for the enquiry.
	I am browsing through my (now somewhat tattered) copy of 
_Interglossa_ and will try to summarize the verb ("operator") system as 
best I can.  Actually, if anyone has the ability to scan and copy the 
book to the net, I'd be interested in such a project -- I think it 
worthwhile.
	Anyway....

	Like Glosa, there is no accidence:  the words do not change for 
grammatical function.  The operators end in 'e,' which is a help.  'No' 
is preposited (as a separate word) for 'not,' 'nun' for the present (if 
it is desired to state the tense, 'pre' for the past, and 'post' for the 
future.  These 3 latter are not essential.  Then,

X acte A Y 		X performs the action A on Y
X date A Y		X confers the attribute A on Y
X detecte A Y		X discovers the property A of Y
X dicte A Y		X conveys the communication A to Y
X esthe A Y		X experiences the sentiment A towards Y
X gene A ex Y		X acquires the attribute A from Y
X habe A de Y		X has the attribute A in relation to Y
X perde A causo Y	X loses the attribute A because of Y
X reacte A Y		X responds to the stimulus A applied by Y
X stimule A Y		X evokes the response A from Y
X tene A Y		X conserves the attribute A on behalf of Y
X tracte A apo Y	X withdraws the attribute A from Y

It is immediately clear that Hogben took most of this from the Greek (as 
he explains) and doesn't change spelling very much.

There is also the particle 'ge,' which equals 'pre gene' or provides a 
passive participle  
	u ge dicte verba = the spoken word

For example,
	X date eco Y = X puts up Y (gives shelter to)
	X gene bio = X comes to life
	X tracte claustro apo Y = X opens Y
	X perde chromo = X fades (in color)
	X acte debito = X does his duty
	X dicte no Y = X denies (or refuses) Y
	X stimule volo Y = X tempts Y
	X esthe questio Y = I is curious about Y
		and so on.

The system is really quite ingenious, as I said, but I think that it 
would take a bit of practice to use it well.  Of course, no all possible 
combinations work out to have an English translation, but one need not 
expect them to.

I hope that this gives a bit of the flavor of the system.  There are 
other operators, such as 'mote' 'to move,' but this is fairly complete.

Any questions?
Saluta,
	John     (dicte saluto)

*	Well, Bob Petry raised this and other questions, and these were commented
on by John Schilke and Paul Bartlett.

	I wish to give my understanding of the situation; but, various aspects of
the Ig/Glo conundrum were mentioned.  I would comment on:-
	. the spirit of Interglossa,
	. The verb systems of Interglossa and Glosa, and 
	. the Clark-Ashby continuation
in separate posts. 

The Clark-Ashby Continuation:
	Bob's questions continue ...

*	According to Ron Clark, Hogben was disappointed that his language
proposal had not been taken up popularly after the war.  But, again
according to Clark, Hogben recognised that his Pelican publication was more
of a start, than a complete treatment of the situation, and welcomed
Clark's interest in the language, and authorised his 'continuation' of the
work.

	When I met Clark and Ashby in 1977, they had reduced the Hogben "Sentence
Landscape" (p37 _Interglossa_) of a three-part Part-of-Speech
system:-
	(a) All verboids end in  -e.
	(b) Substantives end in  -a or -i.  Exceptions being two ending in  -o,
and two ending in -u.
	(c) Amplifiers end in  -o.
to one of two parts.

	They had tested Interglossa with learner groups, and were consciously
trying to make the language more usable.  Hence this reduction to having
the base Classical root with either an  -a for nouns (called substantives
by Hogben) or an -o for verbs and modifiers (called amplifiers by Hogben).

	Later in 1977, they had decided to scrap the idea of terminal P-o-S
markers, altogether, concluding that word order would indicate the function
of words.  At this stage, it became apparent that there were mainly two
groups of words in the emerging language, the Classical roots (or
'substantives') that could function as nouns, verbs or modifiers, and the
smaller, more primitive function words that indicated time, relationships
and questions, etc.

	I understood, at that time, that they had declared that any word could
function, within reason, as any part of speech; and that syntax was the
basis of the gramatical system.  This meant that the terminal letter was no
longer a function marker, and, because of this, the words could remain
truer to their Classical derivation ... as far as terminal letter goes.

	The various other changes that occurred between 1981 and 1992, were all
arrived at, as a result of testing the language with learner groups; and,
each change tended towards simplification and standardisation of the
language.  The getting rid of double letters from the Glosa lexicon, is a
clear example of the decision process they used. 	Another was the
generalisation, from Italian, which sounds  'ce'  and  'ci', CHAY and CHEE,
respectively, to a position where all uses of "c" before a vowel are
sounded CH.  Thus, in Glosa, 'k' became used for the hard "c" in Latin words.

	In a word or two, I would say that Clark and Ashby moved away from
Interglossa's formula-base system to derive Glosa with a more natural
relationship between the words - in which function words lead the user from
one word to the next ... there being no affixes to guide (or confuse) them.

	Next post: the Verb system.

Saluta,
 Robin

*John,
	I did not know of your long-term experience with Interglossa.  I have not
had the benefit of this, so am looking at the same change process (Ig -->
Glo) from a different perspective.  I do not want to appear too
heavy-handed in my comments supporting the Clark/Ashby revisions, because
Hogben is not able to defend himself nor demand a right of reply.

	However, I have tried to understand the changes they have made, and their
sometimes incomprehensible ways of presenting the system they have created.
 The fact that they have resisted the production of a Glosa Grammar Book
seems very odd, indeed, until you consider that most of us learnt our First
Language without resort to one.  They are trying to say that the Glosa
which they have derived is so "natural" that it doesn't need the confusion
of an imposed grammatical system; they have, of course, overestimated the
intuitive powers of the bulk of humanity, and, as Paul Bartlett intimates,
confused Anglocentrism with 'naturalism' in language.
	I still feel that Glosa is fairly close to the 'language of thought,' but
am hiding behind an unprovable hypothesis, here, so should not make this a
plank in my policy statement.

*	Here, after looking again at _Interglossa_ p49, I see a pattern that I
had not previously constructed into a percept: Hogben, as a mathematician,
included - probably subconsciously - elements of algebraic thinking into
his verb system.  Now, in reading the fine print, I deduce that this is
very abstract stuff: OK for the computer programmers and natural-born
logicians among us, but not much good for the man down the street, who has
trouble following the logic in the statement, 4ab means ab + ab + ab + ab.
Or, more wordily:-
	jh(b-f)
	John helps ( Bill not Fred )
	John helps Bill, but hinders Fred.

	OK, I have attempted to cross an uncrossable boundary, the one from maths
to semantics, but, so, I fear, has also Hogben.

	Take, for example,  "X tene A Y"  from the list John retyped for the
Glosalist.
	=  X  conserves the attribute  A   on behalf of  Y

Possibly,  "Harry tene amo Mary."  in Interglossa translates into English as

	 Harry has affection for Mary.  	

	My feeling is: more work needed.  This is precisely where Ron Clark came
in: I believe that he perceived Ig to be the most suitable language for
global scientific intercommunication, but he could see that there were
rough edges wanting smoothing, and sharp corners in need of rounding.

	Yes, in Glosa it wouldn't be so very different: Harry habe amo pro Mary.

And ~Harry amo Mary.~ [Harry likes Mary.] is alright, while ~Harry fo amo
Mary.~
[Harry strongly likes Mary.] would be better, if there really is something
going.

	The point that I am trying to make here is that with a language lacking
normal inflections, but having basic P-o-S markers, as does Ig, you are
pushing it a lot trying to get people to learn an abstract set of
mathematical relationships in liu of syntax.
	But ... this mathematical precision, that Hogben built into Interglosa,
might be the very thing that attracts John and Paul to the 'glos(s)a family
of languages.

	However, when Clark and Ashby finally decided to take the trend to its
(logical) conclusion, and form the idea into a language whose phrases were
totally dependent on syntax for their grammar, then the angularity of Ig
just would not work.  A formula-based syntax may have worked while there
were Part-of-Speech markers, but when the language moved over into
'open-plan' mode,
where meaning was determined totally by word order, because there were no
grammatical changes to the words, then there had to be a decision between
even tighter formulae, or a strengthening of the syntactic basis.
	Syntax won.

	As a result of my time in Conlang and Auxlang, observing the various
languages, I have come to the conclusion that there are different
psychological gearings among people, in relation to the way they enjoy
language.
	Some veer towards simplification and the Lowest Common Denominator, as do
I; others revel in the complications of meaning that can be held in a
highly inflected word, as is found in the Esperantic system.

	For reasons of the natural distribution of language ability among the
human population, I have the feeling that the kindest thing to do is to
encourage, for adoption as the Second Language for Mankind, the language
that can be used by the maximum number of educable people.  It is for this
reason that I favour the Glosa 'intuitive, naturalistic' system over the
'formula -based' system of the parent, Interglossa.  The evidence I quote
is from English and Chinese, which are both languages that rely on
intuitive feel, not being rule-based.  While Chinese is uninflected, and
lacks P-o-S markers, in English, such linguistic features are only
partially present, and are minimised.

*	I will agree, that although there is a lot of detail, and it is all there
if you look for it, the style of writing is a bit dense.  I suspect that it
was only as a special favour to Hogben that Pelican agreed to publish his
work during the height of the war; and, I also guess that he was given
strict limitations on the number of pages he could use - owing to
governmental restrictions on non-military use of the very limited supplies
of the thin war-time paper.  The title _Interglossa_ should have been
followed by _Interglossa - Practice Exercises- and _Interglossa for
Travellers_, etc; but, I suspect that the lack of support for the language
combined with the war-time restrictions on civilian publishing dissuaded
Hogben from pushing for more publications and for the setting up of an
Interglossa Users' Group.

	Forced to read the "Forward" of _Interglossa_, I find the book described
as a 'first draft' to 'stimulate fresh thinking.'  Hogben also says, "The
pages which follow are the agenda for a discussion."  And he claims the
book was written during 'empty hours of fire-watching in Aberdeen'.  In the
light of all this, perhaps Glosa is a ''second draft.''

>
*	Paul Bartlett, especially, suggests that the original "spirit" has been
somewhat lost on the path to Glosa.
	In hindsight, I understand Hogben to have forged (the metaphor is to
metalworking) a ^Brave New Language^ with all the cultural enthusiasm of a
Tolkein and the art of a Joyce.  However, I also feel that, in his zeal,
Hogben created a language medium for the supermen who were to emerge from
war cabinet offices and to return from the "front" after the last bomb
dropped.
	However Britain, like most of Europe, had lost many of its 'Supermen' in
the war, had had the s* kicked out of its infrastructure, also, its
scientists were scrambling to re-establish their profession, rather than
looking for new ways to unite scientists, worldwide.  It took Britain
almost thiry years to bounce back - after the war - to a position where Ron
Clark felt ready to 'discus' Hogben's 'agenda', and to attempt to distill
the much awaited international language for scientists.
	The theme is introduced early in Hogben's December 1942 forword:-
  "Because natural science is the only existing form of human co-operation
on a planetary scale, men of science, who have to turn to journals
published in many languages for necessary information, are acutely aware
that the babel of tongues is a social problem of the first magnitude.  Men
of science more than others, have at their finger-tips an international
vocabulary which is already in existence; and a biologist who looks forward
to a health-coscious future cannot fail to recognise how popularisation of
new health standards is daily adding to the stock-in-trade of
internationally current words in daily use."

	Clark and Ashby were still working towards this super-language for science
in 1977, and the language was still quite formularised in its word
relationships ... much as John Schilke reports, " A esthe X Y", etc ... and
the then "Euro-glossa" was shaping into what I dub 'Scientific-scientific'
(a language based on the Classical terminology of science, but also using
joining words from that Classical source - not from a natlang).

	`However!  The big "however" came in 1978, when Clark and Ashby realised
that they were creating a language that, with a little smoothing, would be
usable for people who wished to save the planet, generally, and not just
for those wishing to save it through scientific means.

	Although the changes from that point were subtle and gradual, there was a
gentle move away from the mathematically formulated view of language
towards a more natural(istic) organic one ... in which the relationships
were intended to be more in line with the way the human brain worked, and,
as such, more human(istic).

	There was a gradual change in linguistic orientation away from the
mechanical Chomskyan approach to what I now understand as "Functional
Grammar".  It is this change in linguistic orientation to which, I feel,
John and Paul are reacting.  For very many people, Glosa is already so
deficient in mechanisms of redundancy, that it fails to have what they
consider to be the necessary 'feedback' information ... found in English,
for example, when "boys run" but a "boy runs".

	So, I have to say that it is my belief that the overstreamlined structure
of Interglossa - its 'brave new languge' spirit - is ideal for the
mathematically gifted with a high level of conceptual logic, but requires
more cerebration, for its use, than is available to the median man.

	In all fairness, and as a matter of urgency, I ask Paul to outline the
measures he feels necessary for Glosa to be "salvageable."

*	I have met Clarke and Ashby, and spoken to them at length, was alive
during war-time restrictions and the following post-war reconstruction
period, and have read enough of Hogben's _Interlingua_ Forward to realise
that he had made his contribution to science with the publication of this
'draft', leaving the matter open for discussion.  Tha sadness was that
Clark opened the discussion so late in Hogben's life that there was no
opportunity for a cross-fertilisation of ideas between the two.

*	I understand that in the period 1972 - 77, before I met them, Ron and
Wendy had set up experimental groups using the language as they were
working on it.  As I understand, feedback from these groups led the
authors, of what was to become Glosa, into changes that put a more 'human'
face on the language.

*	And yet, I enjoy doing logic problems because they are a stimulation and
challenge to the brain.  I do not enjoy Esperanto, because it offers the
same sort of challenge and stimulation, but I desire from it communication,
and know that there is a (are) less challenging way(s) of achieving such
communication.  Analogously, I find the 'softer' streamlining of Glosa less
of a challenge than that of the excessively elegant Interglossa.
	While I could learn the inflectional system of Esperanto, and I could
learn the verb system of Interglossa, I prefer to concentrate on the
subject matter of what I am saying or writing, rather than on the method of
delivery.  It is for this reason that I think Glosa is better for
communication than either Esperanto of Interglossa, because the medium is
less in the way of communication, than it is in these earlier forms.
	Is it "-ist" or "politically incorrect" of me to raise the 'I.Q. Factor'
here?  Auxlangers all have ability above the average [=~ 110 I.Q.], and, as
such, are better at logical relationships than the 'man/woman in the
street': we are able to play with language at a higher level of
sophistication than the (statistical) next man; but does this mean that we
should craft an auxiliary language to suit ourselves, or to suit the bulk
of mankind?

  In fact, when I was playing around with a project I called

*	I think it is possible that Interglossa could have had a much more
general testing, globally, but Hogben's timing was just unfortunate.  None
of us forsaw the extent of the "Cold War"; and most of us expected, in
1946, the return of what were known as 'pre-war conditions'.
	I believe that Clark and Ashby did give Interglossa as fair a trial as
they could.  When you consided that permission to 'redraft' the language
was given in 1972, and, by 1977, the language was still on the drawing
board, with the major modification only a change from the three-inflection
P-o-S system to a two-part grammar system (V -e; N -a or -i; Mod -o ---> N
-a; V & Mod -o), I believe that the two 'redrafters' spent five years in
trying to make Interglossa - renamed Euro-glossa, by this time - work.

	If you go from Hoben's writing of the forward to his book (1942), to the
realisation on the Internet of Conlang (1991),  that makes it almost half a
century from the conception of Hogben's dream of something better for
science, to the gathering of like minds through the marvels of the Net's
electronic interface, for the formal start of discussion on Hogben dream.
	Its a slow world we live in.

	Around the 1978 mark, Clark and Ashby had come to the conclusion that
while the basic principles of Interglossa were sound, they could not
rationally tweak the Hogben pattern any further: they had reached the stage
of needing a complete restart based on the Ig principles.  The drawing
board was wiped clean, and a rebuild was begun.  This might be the time
that Paul would say the Ig spirit was lost.

Interesting evolution, that of the POS markers -> simplified POS markers
-> no POS markers, thereby allowing the concept-word idea, which is one
of the things that attracted me to Glosa. I still tend towards the idea
that *any* word can be used as *any* part of speech. Though some words
fight me on this, insisting that they are, indeed, nouns.

But I think that allowing the words to remain truer to their classical
derivations brings in further complexities. What about the users who
lack the classical background? Or even worse, have a background which
conflicts with *the* classical background?

I saw while analyzing the dictionaries and any Glosa texts I found...

   1) Inconsistencies in the spelling of words which end in a vowel,
      usually between a/o and e/i. Sometimes even within a dictionary,
      a word will be spelled in both ways, which leads us to...

   2) Many words differ only in the final vowel (terminal, or within
      the final syllable). Substitution may create a homonym.

(I'm sorta thinking out loud here, if that can be said of email.)
I don't want POS marking, both for Simplicity and Euphony. But the lack

I rather like double letters, but knowing that there are *none* solves
those situations where I just can't recall whether a letter was doubled
or not. (One that bites me every time: address. Let's see, was that one
s or two. Adreso; one. Oh, wait, that's Esperanto. Adress. Yeah, that's
it. Wait a minute; doesn't look right; better look it up. Again. Doubled
s, yeah, oh, and doubled d too! Okay, got it.)

One letter, one sound. I like that. Except for SC, which I won't mention
because I like it, and every rule wants one (just one!) exception, and it's
like Old English (biscop, disc, Englisc, fisc (n), fiscian (v), fiscere (m),
scip, and the classic: sceat (originally dirt, or soil, haha!))

    I will reply to two related small excerpts of Robin's messages.
I notice that Robin's dates are still off. :-)

On Wed, 12 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

    I have begun to change my thinking slightly in this matter.  It 
is true that small children do not learn their mother tongue from a
grammar book.  However, they do learn in a context with both verbal and
non-verbal feedback from their elders.  It is this lack of context and
feedback over which I have taken exception to the "Mechanics of Glosa"
paradigmatic sentence approach.

    But perhaps not all is lost, and it may not be necessary to publish
a formal grammatical statement for didactic reasons, although I still 
think that such a statement should be available somewhere.  The
"Mechanics of Glosa" relies almost entirely on phrases and short
declarative and interrogative sentences mostly consisting of a single
clause.  Therefore, the approach does not provide enough context for
people really to learn how the language operates.

    Perhaps it could be salvageable if there were more numerous and
longer examples.  Expand the "Mechanics of Glosa" substantially, with
many more complete utterances of many types.  Add small paragraphs of
connected text.  Demonstrate word order and use of particles much more
fully.  Use examples to provide the context that the current method
lacks.  Do not assume that "everybody knows" automatically how to put
the words together.  People with widely varying language habits may
think that certain ways of doing things are "natural," but they will
differ.  *Demonstrate*, not assume.  With enough of the "Mechanics,"
people could "learn by doing" without the need for a formal statement
in teching materials.  I just do not think that the current approach 
is adequate.


On Thu, 13 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

> 	In all fairness, and as a matter of urgency, I ask Paul to outline the
> measures he feels necessary for Glosa to be "salvageable."

1)  Improve the "Mechanics of Glosa" as I outlined above.

2)  Get rid of the alternate words for the same thing in the
    vocabulary: one concept, one Glosa word (not one Greek, one
    Latin, or whatever)!

3)  Remove the inconsistencies in published lists, such as different
    terminal vowels for the same Glosa word; in some cases, two
    distinct Glosa words differ _only_ by their terminal vowels, so 
    the current situation invites mass confusion.

4)  Firm up the basic vocabulary to however many words are needed (my 
    estimate has been around 2000).

5)  Emphasize strongly to avoid idiomatic constructions.  (I realize 
    that Robin may disagree with me on this.)  A&C have said themselves 
    to write in "clear, unidiomatic Glosa" and then have fallen into 
    idioms themselves (at least in the few copies of Plu Glosa Nota 
    that I saw).

6)  Improve the publications.  (Ashby&Clark's personal circumstances 
    are not really relevant.)  Remove the inconsistencies between 
    publications.  Relatively small, inexpensive booklets are still 
    a good idea, but I do not consider the present ones adequate.

7)  Get Clark&Ashby to sign off on the improvements, unless they are 
    willing to do like Zamenhof with Esperanto and put Glosa in the 
    public domain.  (Above all, do not try to do as Schleyer did with 
    Volapük.)

8)  Get the word out better (however this may be done.)

9)  Start using Glosa (which I admit that I have not done too much 
    of myself).

    I have said before that I consider Glosa to be a generally good
idea.  I still do.  It's just that I do not think that it has been 
presented as effectively as it might.

>
*	The trouble comes from those who KNOW what it should be, not from those
who don't.  The square head who declares that a particular word should end
in an "i", and finds it, instead, with an "e" rejects Glosa for its
historical inaccuracies; people with no Classical background, will, simply
take thew word as it appears in the Glosa dictionary [[and will be happy as
long as each dictionary reference to the word is consistent]].  However ...

>
*	Such inconsistencies would have been avoided had the original
dictionaries been compiled from electronic databases.  The original lists
were compiled, however, by hand, using typewriters.  Thus, now .. that
computers are being applied to the job .. we can clean up former duplicate
spellings, and settle on the one (most) correct spelling for each word that
might have different spellings in different dictionaries, or in different
parts of the same dictionary.  From the research point of view, the authors
were actively experimenting with the spelling of words, and, over time,
some words did vary - maily in the terminal vowel.  Using hand editing, it
is not surprising that some words, whose spelling was revised, were not
corrected in all of their listings.

>   2) Many words differ only in the final vowel (terminal, or within
>      the final syllable). Substitution may create a homonym.
>
*	The different spellings are not substitutions: now that Glosa is
congealing into a regular language, we have to label the non-preferred
versions as "mistakes."  But, around the early 1980's the authors
"deregulated" the use of the final vowel to see how things would shake
down, and glosa-pe were free to select the vowel that seemed right for
them.  I consider this to have been a legitimate research ploy - then -
though the concept of 'floating' spelling might be incomprehensible to us,
now.  So, now, we have a few loose ends to tie up: this is the time for
standardisation of Glosa's spelling, with an overall guide for the
selection of terminal vowels for words, and another rule for the decision
on words that computer sorting reveals to have two, or more ways of being
spelt.
	The decision to "re-regulate" the spelling was taken because some elements
of the Classical lexicon were found to be very close, differing
only in the terminal vowel.

>(I'm sorta thinking out loud here, if that can be said of email.)
>I don't want POS marking, both for Simplicity and Euphony. But the lack
>of consistent terminations makes spelling more difficult. What to do?
>
*	Obviously, the "mistakes" have to be rectified as the "re-regulated" 
spelling is neatened up around the edges.  Finding alternative spellings
for the same word annoys both the pedants and those who are linguistically
naive.
 
>> The getting rid of double letters from the Glosa lexicon, is a
>> clear example of the decision process they used.
>
>I rather like double letters, but knowing that there are *none* solves
>those situations where I just can't recall whether a letter was doubled
>or not. (One that bites me every time: address. Let's see, was that one
>s or two. Adreso; one. Oh, wait, that's Esperanto. Adress. Yeah, that's
>it. Wait a minute; doesn't look right; better look it up. Again. Doubled
>s, yeah, oh, and doubled d too! Okay, got it.)
>
*	Actually, because English features both short and long vowels, the double
letters had a very clear function in allowing the shortenning of vowels
that were not in the penultimate spot, EG 'fat'; 'fattening'.  They also
functioned to stress the doubled consonant, EG 'his'; 'hiss'.  You can
never misspell "address" again when you realise that this particular word
demonstrates both of these rules!
	Glosa, of course, has standardisation in the pronunciation of both vowels
and consonants, and so, such rules, as exist in English, have no relevance:
thus a reason for the doubling of letters does not exist.

>> sounded CH.  Thus, in Glosa, 'k' became used for the hard "c" in Latin
words.
>
>One letter, one sound. I like that. Except for SC, which I won't mention
>because I like it, and every rule wants one (just one!) exception, and it's
>like Old English (biscop, disc, Englisc, fisc (n),  [  .....  ]
*	This is possibly the short end of standardisation of
spelling/pronunciation: both the soft "J" of 'jump' and the soft compound
"SH" of 'fish' got lost in the shuffle.  In Glosa ~sc~ is pronounced as two
sounds "S-CH", both hard, while ~sk~ is more fluid, with the two hard
sounds running together to make "SK" as in the English word, "sky".

	While you like "fish" and "ships", I enjoy a "jolly" "jump"; time could
possibly tell if these losses are too much to pay for the standardisation
of spelling and pronunciation.

Saluta,
 Robin

*	Re 'intuitiveness': I now believe that most people need lots of good
examples so they can learn by observation and imitation: those who will
readily pick up the rhythms and essence of Glosa are not necessarily the
ones who are academically 'good at languages.'
	Re Anglocentrism: Glosa really does have to break out of the English-
language community so that this matter may be "tested" through its
widespread use among people with no, or little, English.

*	Agreed a much fuller treatment is needed - we wouldn't go too far astray
if we followed the format of _Teach Yourself Esperanto_.	 Many more graded
examples are needed!

*	Agreed, this ought to be available, in spelt-out form, for those who
demand it: and, it should also be available in "quick reference" form for
normal users, who want to check their usage.
 
>The "Mechanics of Glosa" relies almost entirely on phrases and short
>declarative and interrogative sentences mostly consisting of a single
>clause.  Therefore, the approach does not provide enough context for

>
*	This matter of the missing context could be the stumbling block of
Glosa.  Short segments: "In the home," "At the office," "On the train," etc,
would fill out the usage of the language.  Such things could be sorted out,
here on the Glosalist: were one of us to submit a mini-script of, say, a
conversation in an office, then others could ammend it, as they think will
improve it as a piece of pseudo-context; and subsequently, by concensus, a
final version emerges.

*	Thank you Paul for spelling it out; I am sorry that I did not see this
before, but you are quite right: the shortage of news items in "PGN", by
people other than the authors, attests to the difficulty people find in
getting started with Glosa.

> *Demonstrate*, not assume.  With enough of the "Mechanics,"

>
*	The present "18 Steps to Euroglosa" is the main teaching vehicle; perhaps
a range of different materials using different approaches is now overdue.

>1)  Improve the "Mechanics of Glosa" as I outlined above.
*	Yes, such texts of the language used in different contexts would need to
be available in paper (mailable) form, as well as on the Net.  If Glosa-pe 
wrote out a text of dialogue, or gave some other example of Glosa being
used, in their particular area of interest, we should soon build up a sheaf
of context examples

>3)  Remove the inconsistencies in published lists, such as different

*	A must.  Some find such inconsistencies intolerable, causing them to
discontinue learning Glosa.

>4)  Firm up the basic vocabulary to however many words are needed ( ~2000).
*	A practical list, as you are defining on Auxlang, will give learners
sufficient words to practice their usage.  Personally, I found the Glosa
1000 list too limiting, so the actual size of a comfortable, working
"beginners'"	
vocabulary probably should be open to discussion.

>5)  Emphasize strongly to avoid idiomatic constructions.  (I realize 
>    that Robin may disagree with me on this.)  [  ..........  ]
*	If this is necessary to get people comfortable with Glosa, I agree, and
have agreed, in principle, from the start.  However, the full language will
be felt to be 'sterile' without the development of a non-literal component.
 In Auxlang, I was arguing for a facility whereby idiom and
culture-specific metaphor can be marked as ^non-literal^, when the writer
feels the need to use them - for emotional impact, or when they are
included in reported speech.

>6)  Improve the publications.  (Ashby&Clark's personal circumstances 
>    are not really relevant.)  Remove the inconsistencies between 
>    publications.  Relatively small, inexpensive booklets are still 
>    a good idea, but I do not consider the present ones adequate.
*	This could be a call for the Glosa-pe to "support their language" by
submitting news items and other articles for inclusion in the PGN.  It
might also indicate that we can submit other publications to the authors
for inclusion in the Glosa Publications Catalogue: I for example, have got
bogged down at three stories, when I should be churning out Glosa
retellings of children's stories at one a month ... for "Plu Histori pro
Ju-pe."
	Paul, I would appreciate your list of prospective titles that would
^pepper up^ the catalogue of "inexpensive booklets."

>7)  Get Clark&Ashby to sign off on the improvements, unless they are 
>    willing to do like Zamenhof with Esperanto and put Glosa in the 
>    public domain.  (Above all, do not try to do as Schleyer did with 
>    Volapük.)
*	As far as I know, the language has reached its base-mark.  
The Public Domain:-
	. The Glosalist is a strong move in this direction.
	. My writing of children's stories was an attempt to widen the base away
from technical writing.
	. The scanning of the 6000 dictionary, and the subsequent reversing of
entries, from Gl-->Eng to Eng-->Gl, was an attempt to standardise spelling
and dictionary entries.
	. Bill Patterson's continuation with the dictionary rationalisation works
towards making the dictionaries Public.
	. Your work in deriving the standard Auxlang word list is a guide we
should aim to conform with.
	. Use of Glosa in the field ... should call in volunteers to correspond
with people in the Third World, who are ^putting their stamp on^ Glosa usage.
	. As more people contribute towards the development of the language and
its literature, then we will continue the move over into the Public Domain.

>8)  Get the word out better (however this may be done.)
*	This is the hardest to solve.  As media become syndicated and
centralised, and as dangerous concepts like "economic rationalism" and
"political correctness" gain currency, the idea of World Community becomes
unpopular.  In theory, the Internet should provide the route to the world ...
but, then, we still have the English language barrier to overcome, as you
have mentioned before.

>9)  Start using Glosa.  [  .......  ]  
*	This does seem the clue; and the preparation of suitable demonstrations
of Glosa, in use, would appear to precede this!  So, less writing in
English - about Glosa - and more writing in Glosa, seems the order of the day.

*	Thanks for seeing the ^wood^ even though some of the ^trees^ might get in
the way, and others might be short of branches.
	Have others on this list suggestions of what they would like to see as
part of Glosa's presentation?
	Please ponder on it, and submit your ponderings.

3. I question the syntax of ~simul~.  It is in the 'normal' place for English,
but, in Glosa, should it 'lead up to' the verb, by going before it ...
funtioning here more as an adverb, than as an auxiliary verb?  

  ~u tri lupus pa este simul kontenta e no-certe .. ~  
OR
  `u tri lupus pa simul este kontenta e no-certe .. `

 = "the three wolves simultaneously felt content and uncertain .. "
 ------------------------
	However, it was mainly about the use of negatives, in Glosa, that I wished
to comment.  The Glosa NO- words don't always seem to match up with our 
beloved English-language ones.
	Glosa  ....  English
	ne  .......  do not  ___________  used with verbs
	??  .......  un-   _____________  the opposite of the action of a verb  
        no-  ......  un-  ______________  used with modifiers and nouns(?)
	nuli  .....  nothing

	No!  ......  No!  ______________  opposition, a definite negative 
	No.  ......  No.  ______________  an answer in the negative
	zero  .....  nil, mathematical nothingness
	zero-pe  ..  no-one, devoid of persons
	zero-ra  ..  nothing OR nothingness
	ni X ni Y  . neither X nor Y
 	retro-  ...  reverse  __________  used with verbs: to act in reverse
 
Perhaps, Bill, you have already commented on the need for maybe one or two
more forms of the negative. 
Possibly "NON"  
	non-  .....  un-, non-  _________  possibly before nouns and modifiers

What do Subscribers think?  Are there other potential negatives, for Glosa,
waiting in tne wings?

 -----------------------------------------------------
"mi es itera in Uganda" - elsewhere in PGN 82 is a photo of Herbert and
Wendy   together in Italy.
"na mira lingua" - Herbert thinks Glosa is pretty good.
"RUGGOTEC" - an enterprising initiative: with government encouragement,
Herbert and friends have set up a park where tourists can see the famous
Mountain Gorillas, where .. coincidentally .. they might also learn about
Glosa (signs, publications, Gorilla information in Glosa, etc).
"pa merka 3 akra" - amid crushing poverty have organised enough money to 
  buy land.
"pa tekto u via" - actually being practical.
"space pro u domi" - to run RUGGOTEC, I presume.
"U centra nu es un NGO" - if this means it is a governmentally registered 
  NGO, then well-wishers from the affluent countries can send in moribund
technical equipment without incurring the otherwise prohibitive import
duties.
"publika id ci in Uganda e extra-landa" - organised enough to publish their 
  work globally.
"In januari mi pa duce u proto stude-setimana." - have run a week's course
on   Glosa.
"pa grafo un idio sko-bibli pro u-ci ergo." - a group wrote their own

Oooooohhh, yecch! As nostalgic as I get at times, that's one thing
I do *not* miss. I always liked typewriters because they made my
writings look so much better, but oh the sadness I felt when well
into a page and suddenly realizing that I'd spelt 'adress' again a
few lines back. But I still think carbon paper was pretty cool.

I like that idea. How did it turn out? Did any significant trends emerge?
I wonder if two of the words for 'snow' came from this period: nifa & nivi.

I confess that due to my Esperanto background I have to fight the tendency
to end nouns with -o and adjectives with -a. But I do like 'noktu'.

If there were no pairs of words that differed only in the terminal vowel,
then it wouldn't matter what terminal vowel was used; though a good choice
of terminal vowels might help differentiate words which would otherwise
sound too similar. Like the 'nifa' and 'nivi' I mentioned above, though
that's a pretty bad example because they *do* mean the same thing. But
'nif' and 'niv' would be harder to distinguish than, say, 'nifa' and 'nivi'.

What sort of guide for the selection of terminal vowels? Perhaps data

But the Glosa Basic Reference says "SC as the 'sh' sound in neSCience",
and my dictionary says that's pronounced "nesh'i-ens". Perhaps GLOSAREF

Funny you should mention that. Just a few days ago curiosity struck

*	In theory, we will get the best results, for all, if ideas and opinions
are pooled - hopefully resulting in a concensus.  But this is a statement
of the idealised situation.  The "replacement" ploy depends on the putting
together of alternatively worded leaflets, and, in some cases, considerable
original work to come up with exercises and examples that are more suitable
for learners than are the present ones: this might involve some hammering
out of policy on instructional methods .. and even of gramatical principles.
	"Replacement" also involves some retooling at Glosa Central, and this is
not without cost.  Originals of Replacement leaflets would have to have
printing plates prepared: there could be a cost-based inertia here,
opposing change.

*	Agreed, I must raise the matter with the authors, who are on the net at 
 glosauk{at}cix{dot}compulink{dot}co{dot}uk .  For economic reasons replies to our emails
will be by snail mail.
	The current work with dictionary rationalisation, at present being mainly
done by Bill Patterson, is to this end.  But the economics of retooling
would still be a consideration for the authors.

meanwhile, cross our fingers that sales of present books generate the

Autori-pe e plu membra de Glosalist, Ave!
	Here is a "Redirection" of Thomas Wood's personal note to me. [Am I
breaking confidence OR 'invading privacy' by publishing to a select group:
comments please?]
 ----------------------------
Robin -

Glosa has always attracted me on account of its emphasis on minimal
grammar.  However I do not believe in no grammar at all. 

I have not found Glosa really easy to understand.  I prefer the basic
vocabulary of Ido with which I am much more familiar.

I am in favour of grammatical freedom in Ido.  Then Ido can be written
in different ways.  One can write using minimal grammar e.g. me skrib
Ido nun per uz di radik-vort.  Of course, there must be a sufficient
number of vowels to make the pronunciation easy.  I think it is a good
idea, in general, to indicate the verb.

Best Wishes

Tom
 -------------------------------
	So, actually Thomas is an honest person, a good guy, and - in Glosa terms
- a statistic.
RESPONSE??
  Do we all study Ido to see exactly what its attraction is?
  Should we try to understand the different psychological gearings people
bring 	with them to the Language Reform process?
  After finding all of the Glosa words in either the Latin or Greek
dictionary, and assuring people that the Classical lexicon is well 		known
to scientists and people who have studied the Humanities, do 	 	we try to
understand a preference for "the basic vocabulary of Ido"?
  Do we recognise that, for some people, a simple statement of the
functioning 	of the grammar behind Glosa is necessary?
  Might we take Thomas' "defection" to Ido as a sign that the "NO GRAMMAR"
tag, 	as well as being factually wrong, is also misleading to the point of 
	being counter-productive?
  Do the people who understand the functioning of Glosa present the
language in 	its more "kindergarten" form so that people can " .. find
Glosa really 
	easy to understand .. " as did the school children at Atlanta's Oak
Ridge Middle School?
  Do we look into the rigidity/flexibility dimention of Glosa's syntax-based
	grammar .. to demonstrate to new learners places where the syntactic
pattern is prescribed, and where variations can occur without loss of
meaning?
  Might we look into "verb marking" or find some educational way of
ensuring 		that users, through proper use of syntactic structures, make it
quite 		plain where their verbs are?
  Or do we do all of the above?

CRISIS POINT
	As I see it, the question of Glosa's unspoken grammar is due to 'come out
of the closet' so that new learners, of a psychological gearing like Tom's,
can enjoy and get on with the language.

	Do we teach people that Glosa is, in point of fact, "head final"?  Years
of Conlang membership resulted in my gleaning that this is the accepted
technical description of phrases in which the substantive word is last.  I
guess that we could find some appropriate way of presenting this fact to
new learners - using non-technical language - so they could avoid
guess-work on this essential point of Glosa grammar, right from the start.

	Do we teach people that 'elision' is alive and well and in Glosa?  By this
I mean that the 'telegramatic' style of Glosa, which would be equivalent to 
its vernacular form, if it had a community of speakers of ~living Glosa~,
has bits left out.  For the new learner, which bits have been left out, and
from where, can become a critical question in their ability to progress
with the language.  In the same way that children speak 'baby language'
before progressing to the vernacular, I propose that Glosa learners be
taught to use 'babi Glosa' with all the missing bits in place, before they
learn to 'intuitively' drop out the 'elidable' words.
	An pa ki ad an domi.  ...............  He went home.
	An pa ki a domi.  ...................  He went home.
	An pa ki domi.  .....................  He went home.
	An ki domi.  ........................  He goes home.

	On 'marking' the verb, I could imagine writing:-
	U kanis pa VORA u felis. 
but this would be an imposition equivalent to the German capitalisation of
nouns.  And, Paul Bartlett would hasten to demand that I tell him how to
pronounce a capitalised word differently from its lower-case form.
Actually, I would have to request that people doubled their decibels or
went up, or down, an octave to emphasise the verbs.
	Back to the drawing board: maybe it would just be easier to teach people
to use an accepted form of Glosa syntax, so that the verb, or verb phrase,
was obviously apparent - by inspection - every time.  And I am still
actively looking for a way of colouring words in e-mail, so that verbs were
red and nouns green.  Once it was up and running, I think modifiers should
be blue, with  adjectives light blue, and adverbs a darker shade.  Jokes
aside, this could help learners - as it obviously would have done in Tom's
case: does anyone have any technical data on how I can implement this in
Eudora Pro Ver 3, or in HTML for offline reading from disk?

	Ave Thomas!

Saluta,
 Robin

>   Do we all study Ido to see exactly what its attraction is?

I've studied Esperanto a lot and Ido a little. Of the two I think I'd
prefer Ido if I hadn't already invested so much time in Esperanto, and
if Ido were more widely used.

Ido shares much of its vocabulary with Esperanto but there are also many
differences. Of particular interest to me: although classic Esperanto
forms opposites by negation (as in right and opposite-of-right for
right and left), Ido has separate words for these antonyms (although
the negation-method would be understood also). But in literary Esperanto,
and often in everyday conversation, the separate words are often used.
It seems to me that as people expand their vocabularies, they prefer to
have separate words for such antonyms. This would also make the meaning
more clear under circumstances in which a word fragment might be missed,
possibly inverting the meaning!

The grammar of Ido seems to fall somewhere in between that of Esperanto
and Glosa, as Tom has found. While Ido retains some inflections, it
discards others, using syntax instead. For example, while Esperanto
requires inflection of a direct object, Ido does not (*unless* the order
of the subject and object are reversed) because, as in Glosa, it is
understood that the subject (usually) precedes the object. For objects,
Ido requires inflection only when the user does something unusual.

Perhaps the vocabulary of Ido is more recognizable to many of us because
it is based upon languages of today (or not so long ago), while that of
Glosa is based upon their ancestors, older forms.

Every language has a grammar. Some are just simpler than others. While
Ido forms a plural by changing a final '-o' to '-i', Glosa does so by
using a preceding 'plu' - not so different, really, though Glosa has
the advantage of word invariability. And this touches on something that
I've observed. The most common spelling inconsistency that I've seen in
Glosa texts is in final vowels. And this troubles me also. In Ido or
Esperanto, I know that a noun ends in '-o' (unless pluralized, but *we*
could use 'plu' instead), and if a word ends in '-o', then it's a noun.

> Do we teach people that Glosa is, in point of fact, "head final"?

Yep. Head Final and SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

That's a good idea! But there's really no way to do this in email for
everybody. If your mailer supports color, chances are most of your audience
will have mailers that don't, or that do it differently. Standardization
hasn't yet matured enough. HTML's another story: just wrap your text in FONT
elements; I think most browsers today can handle this. And some mailers,
too. For example, a red Hello and a green world!...

<FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Hello,</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00FF00>world!</FONT>

(If your mailer can handle it, some of you might be seeing the colors
instead of the code!) The sixdigit hexadecimal number after the #
represents the amounts of red, green and blue to use, ranging from 00 (none)
to FF (maximum) for each. Cyan, with no red and equal parts green and blue,
would be #008080 or something close to it. Some browsers can understand
COLOR=BLUE and such, but some don't, so it's best to use the numbers. Also,
you may not get exactly the colors you want. It depends on how many colors
your computer supports.

That's a good idea! But there's really no way to do this in email for
everybody. If your mailer supports color, chances are most of your audience
will have mailers that don't, or that do it differently. Standardization
hasn't yet matured enough. HTML's another story: just wrap your text in FONT
elements; I think most browsers today can handle this. And some mailers,
too. For example, a red Hello and a green world!...

<FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Hello,</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00FF00>world!</FONT>

(If your mailer can handle it, some of you might be seeing the colors
instead of the code!) The sixdigit hexadecimal number after the #
represents the amounts of red, green and blue to use, ranging from 00 (none)
to FF (maximum) for each. Cyan, with no red and equal parts green and blue,
would be #008080 or something close to it. Some browsers can understand
COLOR=BLUE and such, but some don't, so it's best to use the numbers. Also,
you may not get exactly the colors you want. It depends on how many colors
your computer supports.

Hello to Ron & Wendy and Glosalist subscribers,
	Well, this is the second rasberry to arrive on my screen, this week, 
claiming that Glosa is not easy to use.
	Kjell is Swedish, and this might be a significant factor in his not
finding Glosa easy to read.  I will write to Kjell privately, asking for
more constructive feed-back on the difficulties he finds with Glosa: of
course, he has no Glosa dictionary at all.
	He likes Interlingua and uses it in his postings to Auxlang, which I don't
take the time to read; although I can sort Interlingua out, by inspection,
it still takes too long.  I had assumed that if Interlingua can be
'understood' by me, my Glosa postings would similarly be understandable to
Interlingua speakers: but, not so, it seems.
	The following is my translation into Glosa from an original segments in
Interlingua, English and Rap Lin Rie.  The first section (omitted), from
which I translated from a combination of the English and Interlingua
versions, was not included by Kjell.  We play these translation games in
AUXLANG.

    There is, I think, a misapprehension on the part of Glosa-pe about
the recognizability of Glosa words.  I personally doubt that many of
them are as immediately recognizable as thought or hoped.  Lots of
people may *use* words which contain Greco-Latin roots without really
knowing the _meaning_ or those roots themselves.  Those people probably
use the root-containing words as semantic wholes.

    Good job, Robin.  I would make only a couple of remarks.

1)  I think nearly every instance of 'pa' could have been omitted
    (the "historical present").

2)  'Pra' seems no longer to be part of standard Glosa, only
    Gaskell-Glosa.

3)  'U(n)' is a noun marker that need not be used before an obvious
    noun such as 'X-pe'.

4)  It might be worthwhile, as a sort of appendix, to list those words
    which were not taken from any of the so-called "Glosa 1000" lists
    but rather from Glosa 6000 or some other source, in order to help
    determine which words might profitably be added to the basic
    vocabulary (which collation shows to be more like Glosa 1500).

(As an aside, would you consider indenting the first lines of your
paragraphs fewer than eight spaces?  So much indentation causes
unsightly wrap-around on my display.)

I just can't stop thinking about those terminal vowels!

1. If the terminal vowel is used to mark part of speech, I think that this
makes the language easier to learn, to write and to read. But uglier, and
repetitive, because (generally) *all* words must be so marked. Less natural.

2. If it is not used to mark part of speech, then the language is harder
to write because you must memorize the correct endings; and harder to
read because you lose some indication of part of speech. But it is more
natural, and would probably make the language more comfortable to use
*in the long run*. And you can end words with a consonant.

Glosa has its own way of handling parts of speech, so it doesn't need POS
marking by terminal vowels. Indeed, the choice of terminal vowel is somewhat
arbitrary, determined by the designer's ear and consideration of words that
differ only in the final vowel.

If we removed/replaced all but one in each group of words that differ only
in the final vowel, we could once again allow users to use any vowel they
wish. Or, sometimes, none.

I like this freedom. I think it would result in a more beautiful language,
in a personalized kind of way - it would also be easier to learn because
it would decrease memorization - perhaps it would even sound better to
speakers of any particular language because they would be able to mold it
slightly towards the sounds of their own languages.

One advantage that most modern IALs have over Glosa is easy creation of
words and immediate recognition of their parts of speech, because the
final letters are fixed, have meaning, and the meaning is consistent.
In Glosa, the final letters are fixed but have no meaning or consistency.

Except for words that differ only in the final vowel, the final vowel is
totally arbitrary. So why not get rid of those problem words and then give
the user this flexibility?

It would certainly be different...

    Nor I.  I think the terminal vowel business is a pressing one for
Glosa.

    In different official G.E.O. publications we have "salta/salti" 
both meaning "jump/leap," whereas we have "seta" meaning "bristle" 
and "seti" meaning "seven."

    POS marking might also make it more difficulat to switch words among
parts of speech due to terminal-vowel collisions.

    Personally I do not favor this.  I think it would impede
communication among different persons.

Funny you should mention that. Just a few days ago curiosity struck

Oooooohhh, yecch! As nostalgic as I get at times, that's one thing
I do *not* miss. I always liked typewriters because they made my
writings look so much better, but oh the sadness I felt when well
into a page and suddenly realizing that I'd spelt 'adress' again a
few lines back. But I still think carbon paper was pretty cool.

I like that idea. How did it turn out? Did any significant trends emerge?
I wonder if two of the words for 'snow' came from this period: nifa & nivi.

I confess that due to my Esperanto background I have to fight the tendency
to end nouns with -o and adjectives with -a. But I do like 'noktu'.

If there were no pairs of words that differed only in the terminal vowel,
then it wouldn't matter what terminal vowel was used; though a good choice
of terminal vowels might help differentiate words which would otherwise
sound too similar. Like the 'nifa' and 'nivi' I mentioned above, though
that's a pretty bad example because they *do* mean the same thing. But
'nif' and 'niv' would be harder to distinguish than, say, 'nifa' and 'nivi'.

What sort of guide for the selection of terminal vowels? Perhaps data
from the period of deregulation would be helpful here. What did people
prefer?

But the Glosa Basic Reference says "SC as the 'sh' sound in neSCience",
and my dictionary says that's pronounced "nesh'i-ens". Perhaps GLOSAREF
is speaking here of older Glosa? Paul? Help! Robin's unexcepting my

I'm not sure I do either - I was thinking out loud again. But I was
thinking that POS marking can make the words easier to use, because
when writing you can predict how the word is going to end, and upon
reading you can deduce the POS. Also, POS marking via the terminating
letter is not *that* different from placing (but not attaching) a
particle before the word.

On the other hand, if the terminal vowel has no meaning, then the
language becomes *needlessly* more difficult if no other restriction
is placed upon the terminating vowel. And that's what the literature
demonstrates.

"18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa," 3rd edition, 1992, page 5:
    SC always pronounced like Eng. SH

"Glosa 1000 - English," 1994:
    SC as SH in SHow

I thought I read it in at least one additional place, although I cannot
find it at the moment.

*	Agreed, there are some beloved compound sounds that seem to have got lost
in the sift to make Glosa "one_letter_one_sound."

	We were fortunate that the Roman alphabet contained the C, K redundancy,
permitting the allocation of two different sounds to these letters.

	Originally, I thought that J and G had a similar relationship, but no.
The J instead of taking the 'soft G' position was allocated the european
*y* rather than the *dz* that might have been expected by English-speakers.
 This soft gutteral seems to have been lost completely from Glosa.

	And the *sh* that Bill mentions is a legitemate sound, that anyone might
want to make, but is absent from Glosa.  Bill's  SC  to render the *sh*
might be the best option for Glosa words that call out for this sound.
Even in the Glosa world, there will be onomatopea, so the option should be
open to render this sound into print.

	One hard/soft pair that is used less commonly, but is still in Glosa is 
S and Z.  I cannot think of any examples where a soft 's' has been rendered
into Glosa as a 'z', but perhaps there are cases where  Z  is more suitable
in a Glosa word than the  S  that might be suggested by the spelling of the
Latin source-word.
 
	Must close now: have not found time to look at Bill's list of words
needing Glosa equivalents, yet; nor have had a chance to follow up the
basic word list idea suggested by Paul Bartlett.  Is anyone else on this
list interested on working on the dictionary lists?

*	In Glosa it is a very complex situation ... where the "sing-song"
qualities of the C-V couplet results in most words ending in a vowel.  But
the question remains, which one, and is it important?
	In English, on the other hand, most words do not end in a vowel, and there
are not many P-o-S markers around, either.

>1. If the terminal vowel is used to mark part of speech, I think that this

>
*	Memorisation:  no double letters; few vowel pairs; no rules for adding
inflections; no P-o-S differentiations to worry about; say a word to
yourself ten times, and the feel of the terminal vowel will be
internalised; only one spelling per word.
	Reading difficulty: one must read for grammar in Glosa; the syntax is the
grammar; and the syntax (well puntuated, in text; and well inflected, in
speech) clerly indicates a word's function.
	As the language matures: yes, ease of speaking and ease of listening are
the long-term considerations of importance; and the option of having
consonant- terminal words, plus the option of clipping vowels before
vowel-initial words, adds to flexibility and poetry.  Poetry and a
comfortable 'feel' are the qualities that should, I feel, emerge triumphant.

>Glosa has its own way of handling parts of speech, so it doesn't need POS
>marking by terminal vowels. Indeed, the choice of terminal vowel is somewhat
>arbitrary, determined by the designer's ear and consideration of words that

>
*	Agreed, ear comes into it: an ugly-sounding Classical root should not
retain its awkward sound just to remain consistent with its historical usage.
However, if there is a rule running through all of this final vowel
business, I think it should be related to the original Classical
pronunciation (and spelling).

>If we removed/replaced all but one in each group of words that differ only
>in the final vowel, we could once again allow users to use any vowel they
>wish. Or, sometimes, none. 
*	This is a statement in favour of poetry.  Sadly, I suspect that the man
and woman in the street are not yet ready for this level of freedom; also,
I don't know what the speed-reading people or the Dyslexia psychologists
would say about the effect on our brains, of this sort of irregularity in
the reading process.
	But even more damaging to Glosa would be the plethora of different
dictionaries that would be printed, each with its own preferred spellings;
then there would be serious opposition from the regiments of
authoritarian-minded primary school teachers; and there would also be
complaints from the left-
hemisphere dominant school-children, who really do want a word to be spelt
the same way every time.
	The very small minority of Glosa words that differ only in their terminal
vowels, or, as you point to the possibility, the lack of them, these could
have a special rule struck, and few would be the wiser.

>I like this freedom. I think it would result in a more beautiful language,
>in a personalized kind of way - it would also be easier to learn because

>speakers of any particular language because they would be able to mold it

>
*	Again, I like it; but it is the poet's point of view; and, as such, will
be a minority one.  Chinese would get away with it, and probably has, for
centuries.  In Chinese, a more musical final inflection would be
appreciated and perpetuated by listeners, and would not upset the writing
system.  However, in Glosa, as in English, there is a necessary
correspondence between written and spoken forms of the words.
Dictionary-writers, appointed representatives at the U.N., and Elected
Euro-M.P.s are all likely to expect 'standardisation' in the new world
language that they correspondingly publish and vote for. 
	With the IAL, we will have global radio and much more international
telephone traffic: this all depends on the language being heard correctly.
I fear that flexible terminal vowels will cause friction within these
sound-based
media.

>One advantage that most modern IALs have over Glosa is easy creation of
>words and immediate recognition of their parts of speech, because the
>final letters are fixed, have meaning, and the meaning is consistent.
>In Glosa, the final letters are fixed but have no meaning or consistency.
>
*	Agreed, many languages use inflections for semantic change, and Paul
Bartlett forshadowed a change to the (hyphenated) generic affixes, with the
creation of a class of longer semantic affixes, EG -abili.
	As a possible dimention of meaning, the final vowel does offer an
opportunity, but this chance of having Part-of-Speech markers or some sort
of regional or mood colourings indicated by a change in the terminal vowel,
seem to be lost in favour of rigidification of the the lexicon ... perhaps
to aid the machine handling of information.  My belief, as a keen follower
of the fortunes of Bill Gates, is that regular spelling is a better
"marketting" ploy for Glosa than stressing the language's poetic qualities.

>Except for words that differ only in the final vowel, the final vowel is
>totally arbitrary. So why not get rid of those problem words and then give
>the user this flexibility?
*	As I have tried to point out, the final vowel is not arbitrary, but
derived from the Classical root, and, where selection became necessary,
chosen for the most suitable pronunciation.
	I do believe that 'the user' is not ready for such "choice" even though
this is a buzz-word among the hyper-capitalists, at present.  Musicians and
artists, as well as poets would be able to creatively 'play' with the
terminal vowels, but the average person would, I fear, simply see it as a
licence for sloppiness in spelling, and would use the first vowel that
popped into their head, quite uncreatively.

In a bit of reply to Robin's discussion of Bill Patterson's posts:

This is an extremely interesting and valuable discussion, and one which 
we need to continue.  One of Glosa's valuable characteristics is its ease 
of pronunciation and its flow.  I have no significan suggestions at the 
moment but will follow the discourse.
One point did catch my eye.  There is a comment about the use of 
punctuation and the help it gives in understanding.  Frankly, I have 
always felt that the semi-colon [;], used to set off clauses, produces an 
abrupt and disquieting break.  Could we not substitute a monosyllable (in 
the same sense as 'co') for it, leading to clearer speech and euphony?  
Just another fly in the ointment!
Best to all.

Interesting point. I hadn't really thought too much about the semicolon,
though I agree: it always seems to *stop* me more than seems necessary.
I always figured that this was just me, a cultural thing. But no language
comes to mind which uses the semicolon in this fashion, and those that
come to mind while thinking these thoughts all use the semicolon in pretty
much the same nonglosa way. Robin, has there been any research into this
issue? How are semicolons used around the world? Has this been a problem
for those whose native language is not English? How about using a space-
delimited hyphen instead. (That's one use of hyphens that I like.) Some
samples, lifted from the Glosa Basic reference...

Here I use a comma instead of a semicolon, still punctuating, but not as
forcefully:

   The man who ...
   Glosa: U andro; qi ...
   Me:    U andro, qi ...

Here are some examples that really stop me too much, with my alternatives:

   She was singing; when he came.
   Glosa: Fe pa du kanta; kron an pa veni.
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta, kron an pa veni.         # comma instead
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an pa veni.          # is it even necessary?
   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an veni.             # too much pa?

   The woman; who is going round the corner; is my neighbor.
   Glosa: U gina; qi ki peri gono; es me para-fe.
   Me:    U gina, qi ki peri gono, es me para-fe.  # how I'd probably do it
   Me:    U gina (qi ki peri gono) es me para-fe.  # shows the nesting
   Me:    U gina - qi ki peri gono - es me para-fe.

An important difference between those two examples is that one phrase
follows the other in the first example, while one phrase is nested within
the other in the second example. The more straightforward first example
doesn't need as much punctuation for clarity.

From the Glosa Basic Reference, we have...

GBR> 1. Colon precedes items of a list;
GBR> 2. Comma separates list items from each other; it also occurs
GBR>    after a vocative expression.
GBR> 3. Semicolon separates principal and subordinate clauses;
GBR>    a clause is a group of words containing a finite verb.
GBR> 4. Hyphen joins words closely associated semantically.

I dislike hyphens. In 'email' too. In true hacker fashion, I ram words
together without hyphens, or choose different words that won't need
hyphens. Never liked underscores either, and will not use them unless
forced. They're just blank wannabees, and filenames shouldn't have
blanks in them anyway. What was my point? Oh, yeah, the hyphens do make
Glosa easier to read. But I suspect that as Glosa becomes more widespread,
they will disappear. Unless, and here's the big UNLESS: unless the absence
of hyphens causes major parsing headaches. Compound words are created in
Esperanto much as they are in Glosa, but Esperanto doesn't (usually) need
hyphens, because except for a few famous examples, individual elements of
Esperanto compounds are readily recognizable, and the compounds can only
be parsed in one way. This is probably not true of Glosa.

But then, I must confess that I've never let the rules tell *me* how to
punctuate English, and I'm proud to say that (despite what my teachers
believed) the world has finally, in some ways, come to agree with me. My
style has evolved over the years as an interaction between logic, human
languages, and computer languages. (<-- See that extra comma over there?
Even if there is an 'and' in there, I consider that to be a list with the
element separator being a comma). And: He said "I am going now.". No
comma after 'said' - why would we need one? Although the two periods do
look odd even to me, I use them anyway, because that allows proper
punctuation for each of the nested elements. And: "I am going now." he said.
No comma there either; instead, each sentence has its own period. And
something I really disliked was the use of the unnecessary comma *inside*
the quotation! Not only unnecessary, but it moves a bit of the quoter's
punctuation into the quotee!

Hello Glosalisters, All Eight of Us,
	It is a bit windy up here on the pinnicle, with so few of us about: maybe
we will grow in numbers, soon.
	Here is a conundrum that was forshadowed by Paul Bartlett: Jerzy
Wroblewski, from Poland, enquired of the Glosa authors how he could learn
Glosa, and he was sent my contact details.  The short letter I recieved, in
Esperanto - and amazingly easy-to-read Esperanto, at that - announced that
he was a 48 year old engineer, who already corresponds with people in
Esperanto and Ido (his hobby being linguistics), and who wants to learn
Glosa, and give it a whirl, as well.
	I publish both my replies to Jerzy - in Glosa and English - here on the
Glosalist for your information and comment, but primarily to ask for help
on the question of crossing linguistic boundaries ... even at the rarified
atmosphere of Planned Language, and even if with the help of Glosa's
standardised form.

	I plan to jump in with both feet, writing directly to him in Glosa, but
backing up with a ^safety net^ English translation.  He says about English,
that, while he recieved information from Richmond about Glosa,
unfortunately it was in English, and, " ... bedaurinde mia angla lingvo
estas malbona."
	So, either we have a linguistic ^Mexican stand-off^ or Jerzy will read my
Glosa through sheer force of will; and, together, we will have
^sledgehammered^ through the language barrier.

	Any suggestions from the panel!?  I will type Jerzy's letter and publish
it here if people request it.  Can anyone tell me what he actually does at
work, if he reports, " ... mi laboras kiel gvidanto de 
brandfarejo."
	After previous complaints about the non-transmission of "Attachments", I
hesitate to add my letters in the form of an attacment file, but trust that
the improvements to the Net, people's email software, and my Eudora
"Options" all 'harmonise' to produce perfect
transmission of my Jerzy letter to your computer screens.
	The main reason for choosing the ASCII, "Galaxy" word processor to prepare
Jerzy's letter is the infinitely beter formatting qualities of Galaxy over
Eudora.  However, I have squeezed the line length in to 63 characters in
width, and have filled most of the 'white space' with dots - to preserve
the formatting - so hope that you see POLANDJW.ATT on your screen as I saw
it, on mine, before transmission.
	While I suspect that we have no writers of Polish among us, I know we have
Esperantists and Idists.  So, I will put Jerzy's address in here, with the
reminder that he did ask about Glosa, and a plea for others who might wish
to communicate with him, to use more or less "standard" Glosa in their
communications ... not giving the impression that the language is changing
at a rate greater than that of 'normal' linguistic drift.
 Jerzy Wroblewski
 21-305 Suchowola 
 Pollando (Don't forget to mention that "Rob sent you.")

	I have my fingers crossed that he has a DOS computer, and that I can send
him a disk of the "Experimental Dictionaries" to speed up his use of the
vocabulary.  If so, I will send a slimmed down version of the English to
Glosa (6000) file with nothing over two synonyms.
	I am not sure if I overdid my first letter, and whether it is too long,
far too long, or O.K.  Comments please.

	Meanwhile, I am not expecting a torrent of Glosa letters through
Jerzy's letterbox, considering comments on this list, and elsewhere, that
Glosa is not easy to handle.  However, I trust that this - Attached -
letter in Glosa and English will encourage some to see Glosa as reasonably
'cool'.  I did, of course, do the sensible thing, and write the original in
Glosa, translating from this into English.  I do find that a lifetime of
sloppy methods and unconscious elision, combined with a much larger working
vocabulary of literal and non-literal language, makes translation from
English to Glosa sometimes quite painful.
	That's about it, so over and out.
Saluta,
 Robin

    I am a bit pressed for time for several days, but I did want to
make just a few words of reply to Robin's notice of a Polish inquirer

    Any conIAL, if it is likely to go very far, is going to have to
have materials available in various natlangs.  The Esperantists and
Interlinguaists are way out in front on this, and I think the Idists 
on the net are trying to catch up.  After all, we cannot expect all
inquirers to first know English or French or whatever.  That sort of
obviates the purpose of a true IAL, if people first have to learn some
other language in order to learn the IAL.  Unfortunately, I have no
Polish, and my Esperanto is a little weak without a lot of dictionary
use.  (In a pinch I might be able to put something together crudely in
Esperanto, and I can print the accented letters correctly.  I wouldn't
want to try it in Ido, and I don't have a very good Ido dictionary,
anyway.)

    I make this as "I work as a guide in a distillery"  (brand/o =
"schnapps, brandy; spirits").

    In one of the letters, Robin mentioned that he prefers to use Glosa
6000.  I'm not sure I can entirely support this, especially with a new
inquirer.  One of the "selling points" of Glosa is that it is supposed
to make do for basic communication with a modest vocabulary.  My real
complaint all along has been that so-called Glosa 1000 is not quite up
to the job but that a better-selected and perhaps only slightly larger
list might do it.  I think that "6000" is a bit of overkill for the
basic purposes of Glosa.  I opine that all it really needs is a better
"Glosa 1500" or "Glosa 1800" or something like that.  (I haven't
counted exactly, but I think that the Basic Reference on my web pages
has about 1600 words.  That might be a good place to start.  If need
be, I can chop it apart into a better plain ASCII text.)

    Yes.  We native speakers of English do tend to be rather sloppy, I
would say, and this sloppiness and ellipticism can carry over into our
auxlang usage -- Glosa or otherwise.

    All I have time for now.

*	Interesting, I thought, when I was first told, by the Glosa authors, that
a semicolon was used in specific, and different, ways in that language. 	It
was then that I started observing my own use of the semicolon in English,
and wondering if there really was a need for this 'heavy' comma in Glosa,
and if there was possibly a sililar function for it in English.
	Although it is qualitatively different from them, I see the semicolon as
'roughly' between the comma and colon in strength.  With this germ of an
idea I started thinking about the way I joined sentences using the comma ..
instead of an "and."  I found that, in some sentences, I wanted it both
ways: I wanted both the comma and the "and."  You guessed it: a new use for
the semicolon was invented .. 

EG  " ... decided to hide in the bushes; and, while crouched down, there .. "

	This English language usage, naturally enough, transferred over to Glosa
use, as well.  For all I know this 'heavy join' involving both the
semicolon and "and" may be something I picked up in my reading; but, there
seemed a functional case for it.

	Aside aside, I did ponder the functionality of using the semicolon in
Glosa, also.  What rose to consciousness was as follows: Glosa having no
P-o-S markers and no verb inflections, is clarified (gramaticised) in
speech through the normal use of vocal inflection and pauses - to indicate
structure, both phrasal and clausal; however, in it's written form, with
these vocal grammatical effects absent, Glosa needs a strong punctuation to
indicate its sentence structure.
	My guess is that the Glosa authors saw the semicolon sitting there,
somewhat underused, and decided that it was ^just the ticket^ to act as a
clause-marker in Glosa.  Although I considered it as 'brackets' around a
clause, I decided that this was too heavy, altogether, and compromised to
using the semicolon as a 'flag,' at the start of a new clause, placing a comma
at the exit end, where the clause might lead into a phrase.

EG 
 The boys, who are going to the river to catch fish, carry their long rods.

 Plu ju-an; qi du ki ad u fluvi, te kapti plu piski, fero mu plu longi baci.

 Plu ju-an; qi du ki ad u fluvi, te kapti plu piski; fero mu plu longi baci.*

EG
 Three girls, who clothed themselves in thick coats, and who also wore
boots, came in from the snow.

 Tri ju-fe; qi pa vesti mu-auto in paki tegu; e qi pa pluso habe epi mu plu
alti pedi-ve, pa veni in, ex u nivi.

 Tri ju-fe; qi pa vesti mu-auto in paki tegu, e qi pa pluso habe epi mu plu
alti pedi-ve, pa veni in, ex u nivi.* 

>     [  .....................  ]  
>   Robin, has there been any research into this issue? 
*	Well no and yes.  There has been NO establishment research interest in
Glosa: the normal response is that after we get the language up and
running, and when there is a sizable community of users, then the Academics
might notice Glosa's existence.  In realworld terms, Ron and Wendy ARE the
research.
They are, of course, using the "Intuitive" method, rather than one based on
a series of comparative trials using armies of experimental subjects.  This
approach to Glosa's development - a combination of being ignored by paid
researchers, and the ^hand to mouth^ economics of the authors - forces
those working on the language to use their material and intellectual
resources extremely efficiently.
	Can I say that the Glosalist is a part of the Glosa research effort?

>How are semicolons used around the world?
*	Firstly, I don't know.  But, as Glosa is supposed to be presented as a
'language for all' maybe I should worry about this.  However, since the
sentence structure of Glosa is based on that of English, I question whether
we have to go beyond studying English usage.  Considering that English is
being learnt by so many people, and I have not, as yet, heard complaints
from learners, about the punctuation of English, it seems that punctuation
in English (and Glosa) can be accepted as a 'given.'

>     Has this been a problem
>for those whose native language is not English? 
*	This is an excellent question; and, now that I have started writing again
to the only community actively learning Glosa, it is one that should be
raised with them.  In the past, the authors wished to avoid anyone's being
pedantic over grammatical rules, for fear of their frightening off the
unpaid, volunteer experimental subjects.  I would rather co-opt people into
the continuing development of Glosa than ask them, directly, about problems
they are having with the language.

*	Well, the  '-; qi -' suggestion for introducing adjectival clauses in
Glosa, has not worried me; I see it iconically, as a convention.  But, the
semicolon is undeniably ugly: not rounded like a colon, nor neat like a comma.
Its advantages are its presence on the keyboard, and the logic of : > ; > ,
	I am not too sure why the authors saw the need to place the semicolon
before adjectival clauses, but it could just be a ready example of their
perceived need for stronger clause marking in a language with syntax-based
grammar.  In English, the comma does double duty as a divider - between
both clauses and phrases: perhaps there is a case, in Glosa, for a
distinction between such dividers; maybe it is only necessary to denote the
start of a clause - to ensure clarity of understanding.  One value of the
semicolon, however, is that it is a neat marker of elision.

EG
 The man, who was walking along the street, turned into the shop.

 Un andra; qi pa du greso longi u via, pa tropi in u boteka.

+
 The man; walking along the street, turned into the shop.

 Un andra; du greso longi u via, pa tropi in u boteka.

>D.   Me:    Fe pa du kanta kron an veni.             # too much pa?
>
*	Agreed, this semicolon in A. feels like overkill.  The difference between
B. and C. might depend on the writer's desire for the reader to sense a
stress on "kanta" or a rising vocal inflection at the start of "kron": are
we stressing that she was singing, or that he came?  Such questions of
nuance are more in the area of poetry than rule-based grammar.  Was she
singing because he came, or was she singing when he opened the door?
	Getting back to Glosa being a 'language for all': those who are
rule-driven, will want to have a regular pattern for sentence formation;
while poets will break the "rules" creatively to communicate their
particular jist;
and those in the middle will appreciate having some guides to help them
form meaningful sentences, while retaining the right to step outside these
guides, as it suits them.
	The authors want Glosa to be both regularised for pedestrian
communicators, and flexible enough to allow the poet his creativity.  This
is a hard line to follow, and also a hard rule to propound.  As I see it,
the language is now in the phase of having had its guidelines drawn up,
with users of Glosa discovering the way they can make these guidelines work
for them.
	In reality, the language is still 'floating', with the ultimate usage in
the hands - and mouths and minds - of the Glosa-pe. 
	D. is correct if it adequately conveys the intended meaning.

*	The nesting in G. and H. seems unduly mathematical, and I prefer to use
hyphens, as in H., in both English and Glosa, for a different stylistic
function than I use commas.  Agreed, F. is natural, and I like it; but I
see no loss - and a possible gain - in using semicolons to introduce clauses.

*	Quite so, the hyphen is the traditional way of forming compounds, that
preserve the integrity of their constituent parts.  In CyberSpace we do it
differently, and do not suffer Paul's worry about the pronunciation of an
intruded symbol; we also know that computers are bright enough to pick up
the medial capital, and recognise it as the initial marker of a component
word.
	And lo!  The first initial of a compound could be the 'flag' that heralds
the start of a combination word.  BlowMeDown, I could use PartOfSpeech
instead of the traditionally, hyphenated "Part-of-Speech."  E in Glosa id
sio es "MeroDeDice."  Both hyphenated and capitalised versions sound the
same as the apostrophe-marked, twee version, 'mero de dice'; however, the
computer will find either of the hyphenated or capitalised forms more
readable and interpretable than the looser, apostrophe-marked one!

>    Unless, and here's the big UNLESS: unless the absence

*	Ahh!  AI, and all that.  It is my ^gut reaction^ that Glosa is one of the
most readily parsable of languages.  Sadly, I am no programmer, and I
cannot find a programmer weird enough to want to look at Glosa from the
MeaningRepresentationSystem viewpoint.  The programmers I have met, so far,
are too logical to risk wasting their time on a language that might end up
getting out-marketted by something with a faster-talking SalesManagement.

*	Not being drawn into the internicines, I would tend to agree that Glosa
compounds, being uninflected, could be harder to decipher than Esperanto
ones; however, a merodedice in Glosa, comprising smaller words, stands out
instantly as being odd, and would automatically be treated to a ^lower
gear^ mentally, to allow it to be interpreted.  Sadly, for me, a lot of
normal, non-compound words, in Esperanto, look odd.

*	Being system-creators rather than rule-followers is one of the main
qualifiers for earning our "Conlang" ticket.  And, yes, the presence or
absence of that final comma should be more a question of 'feel' rather than
of Linguistic Lore.

*	Very interesting!  The Richmond genii have not mentioned anything about
reported speech, and whether to comma or not, or whether to double dot or
not.	 I unthinkingly 'mapped' standard English-language usage onto Glosa.
	I am quite comfortable with both usages of the comma, and just accept this
punctuation as a literary convention.  However, with elision in the air, 
the pre-quote comma, in Glosa, could go; but I have religious objections to
sentences with a pre-final dot.  Somehow I feel that the sacredness of the
full stop, as a sentence's ^stern flag^ should be preserved.  Sorry about
getting the quoter and quotee tied in a knot; but, I think that the normal
reader reads the final quotation marks subconsciously, and the mark before it
subliminally.  So, for me the " ... last word," final comma is like a proxy
dot.
	However, bring real mind-power to bear on the question, I can screw up my
mind to see a sentence of reported speech lacking the redundancy of
punctuation before either of the quotation marks.

EG
 He said, "Go home," so I went.

 K.  An pa dice "Ki a domi" so mi pa ki.

	And so, are quotation marks sufficient, on their own, or will learners of
Glosa feel there is something missing!?  When might punctuation marks in,
and around, reported speech be needed for functional reasons?

Interesting. I just checked my old "The Office Encyclopedia" (I love
library booksales!) for its comments concerning semicolons. And in every
example they gave, you could have replaced the semicolon with a period,
and the resulting sentences were proper sentences all by themselves. It
seems to just be a way of coupling complete standalone sentences together
more closely, as you found...

Maybe that's why the Glosa semicolons stop me too much. Or perhaps it's
because in C, which I use every day, semicolons are used to terminate a
statement!

That usage probably became necessary when the English pedants took away our
right to begin sentences with "And" and "But", a perfectly legal Old/Middle
English way of writing, which I use often.

Oooooh! How about using hats, as in ^just the ticket^? Though I guess it
doesn't really matter; one would get used to the Glosa usage of semicolons
after a while.

If you've got the QI you don't really need the semicolon before, though
something might be needed *after* the clause to show where it ends. I
think I need to just *use* Glosa more and see what happens.

Hey, I'm weird enough!

Tee hee! But I didn't mean just computer-parsable, but-human parsable too.
A classic Esperanto example is 'sakstrato' - is it sak/strato or saks/trato?
Completely different things, both valid. The context should help, but still...

I'd say they're sufficient, creating just another object to be manipulated
in the sentence. Depending on the learner's natlang, it may appear that
something's missing. But structurally, there should be no difference between
"He ate X" and "He said X".

Saluta,

Regarding for example http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/speaking.htm,

is "o" a pure short o, or does it really have an r!  any hint of a "w"
sound?
is "e" a pure e (like Esperanto) or is it diphthongised (like English)?
is "j" always like 'you' never like 'jet'?
is "y" really used in modern Glosa, or does "i" always replace it?
is "x" always ks, for example is xilo always like ksilo never like zilo?

is "z" a voiced "s" (the international value) or is it "ts" or is it
"dz"?
are diphthongs really avoided in practice (for example is auxi always
a-oo-ksi or does aubreve-ksi creep in)?
another example, is baia always ba-ee-a or does ba-ya occur?

Thanks in advance for your assistance,
Aaron.

PS.  Has the antiinternational "vi" (the plural of "tu") been officially
(whatever that means) replaced yet?
PPS.  Has a sex neutral fe/an been coined yet (like there is in Chinese)
(similar to Esperantic ri)?

    One may use 'pe' as a sex-neutral replacement for 'fe'/'an'.

I believe Glosa would be significantly improved if false friends, especially
critical (eg personal pronoun) ones, were removed.  Glosa probably has very
few false friends (it's one of the design goals of an IAL), and the only ones
I'm aware of are "vi" (Swedish Vi = We, Dutch Wij = We) and maybe "ne" (Greek
Nai = Yes).

    I have never thought of 'vi' as a false friend.  It never even
occurred to me that anyone might consider it such.  To be sure, the
form is not strictly Greek or Latin as such, but Latin forms of the
second person plural pronoun usually begin with "v", as do many of 
the descendant personal pronouns in Romance languages.

    False friends may be an almost unsolvable problem if an IAL is
intended for use around the world, and not just by west-European
speakers.  There are so many human languages which do things so many
different ways that I consider the problem of false friends for
*somebody* to be almost inevitable.  Why should speakers of Romance and
Germanic speakers be exempted from false friends when speakers of other
languages then might have to suffer through them?

    Even if a conIAL had a vocabulary made up essentially randomly of
pronounceable combinations of sounds, there would still be the risk of
false friends for somebody.  To try to comb through the however-many-
thousand languages in this world to eliminate every potential false
friend I consider undoable in practice.

    Another thought that occurs to me as a take-off from Aaron's post.

> On Tue, 26 May 1998, Aaron Irvine wrote (just one short excerpt):
>

    A good point.  Just what does "officially" mean with respect to
Glosa?  The Glosa Education Organization, which seems to consist of Ron
Clark and Wendy Ashby, so far as I know, holds copyright to Glosa
publications.  When I put up the official Glosa world wide web pages, I
was careful to include only material from their publications and to
include copyright notices.  (The "front" page is my own description and
does not include copyrighted material.)

    Rhetorically, do only Clark and Ashby have the right to make any
changes?  Johann Schleyer insisted that only he had the right to
approve any changes to Volapük, and this attitude may have contributed
to its more or less demise.  Leslie Jones allowed people to _use_ his
Eurolengo but would not allow any changes in the language itself -- at
least, that's the way I interpreted things (going from memory, and not
that Eurolengo went anywhere, anyway).

    Ashby and Clark do not even participate in this forum of Glosalist,
and I have no idea whether they are even aware of what does on here. 
Undoubtedly there are some people who are already using Glosa to some
extent who do not use the Internet.  How and by whom can Glosa change, 
if at all?

    One point, in my estimation, needs to be made.  Many authors -- and
sometimes users -- of constructed auxiliary languages seem to want to
tinker them to death.  I think that this is unwise, as the sands are
always shifting under one's feet.  Although many non-Esperantists decry
the action, I personally think that the declaration of of the
"netushebleco" of the "Fundamento de Esperanto" is the best thing that
ever happened to that language.  IALA Interlingua has a solid base in
the Interlingua-English Dictionary and the Gode&Blair Grammar.  Lojban
has been "baselined" for five years.

    For a time I thought that Glosa was in an unsatisfactory state.  I
have ameliorated my position somewhat.  I still think that the
presentation is inadequate, but that is just that, presentation, and
not the language itself.  Also, I think that the selection of the base
vocabulary of "Glosa 1000" -- which seems not to exist consistently --
is partially infelicitous.  However, I do think that there is adequate
material in Glosa 6000 from which a better selection could be made.

    At present, all I think Glosa really needs is a better selection of
base vocabulary from already existing material and better presentation
in more languages.  I am not in favor of using Glosa 6000 wholesale, as
that seems to negate the advantage of a relatively small vocabulary to
be learned.  I advocate just a better selection of a "Glosa 1600" or
whatever.  I do not think that extensive tinkering with the language is
wise.  The basic structure of the language is more or less workable, in
my opinion.

    There has been a running disagreement on the AUXLANG list between
those -- such as myself -- who think that "good enough is good enough"
and those who quest for "asymptotic perfection."  Do I think that Glosa
is "good enough" for basic communication?  Almost.  Again, I just think
that it needs a better base vocabulary selection from already existing
materials and better presentation.

    Presentation I suppose coulds be done by anybody, unless G.E.O.
tries to pull a Schleyer over a copyright issue.  But who has the
authority to make a better vocabulary selection, particularly
considering that there are already Glosa materials "out there"?

The "v" is perfect, it's the "i" that's the problem.  "Vu" would be better (and
maybe easier to remember because it's like "tu"??).

Glosa has the possibility to improve on the Esperanto mess-up:
Esperanto: ni = we, vi = you
Swedish: ni= you, vi = we

True, with 5000 human languages, false friends are always going to occur.

But one can at least check new words against the 12 largest languages to avoid
"serious false friends".   (In contrast to for example "slightly embarrassing
false friends" which would I guess include Esperanto's farti and peti :-)

I consider "vi" to be a  "serious false friend" because a) it's part of the core
language (Glosa-1000), and b) it false-friends to something semantically too
similar and hence confusing.


Is deprecating "vi" and introducing "vu" still possible in Glosa, or is it too
late?

Regards,
Aaron.

I hope they are aware of the list, and I wish they'd participate!  This
discussion list is too important a forum for Glosa big-guns to miss.

True, the internet has not reached everyone yet.  I especially wish that Chinese
speaking Glosaists were present here because their insights into grammar could
be especially valuable in avoiding any subconscious English language thinking /
idioms.

> if at all?

Changes should be few before the baseline, and occur very very rarely afterwards
(=> netushebleco).  Additions are to be avoided unless discussion on Glosalist
reveals them to be really necessary.  (Note that Basic English failed, and a
Glosa-1600 with Glosa-6000 available feels the right size to me).

Who makes the changes?  Well, maybe it should be for voting on Glosalist?
Newcomers like me could propose, but could not vote.

My understanding is that the Glose baseline has not yet been reached, so my
proposal of changing "vi" to "vu" has merit.  In Esperanto "vi" can't be changed
and the language stuck with the problem; in Glosa the door is still open, so the
luxury of fixing "vi" is still available for consideration by the Glosa
list/community.

I agree totally.  Glosa is not a linguistic toy merely to be tinkered with.  My
proposal of "vu" is not made lightheartedly.

I am confused by shifting sands feli/felis, cience/skience.  My Euro-Glosa
(1992) stuff must be outdated -- Glosa needs good configuration management (ie a
Web address that always has the most recent Glosa vocab.)

And I'm annoyed by the couple (only a couple) of faults like vi, su (too much
like sous=under for *me*, but maybe it's okay) and gnata (can't easily pronounce
that one, sorry guys).

I have some ideas on presentation that I'll give later (I need to get vi/vu
sorted first).

See my note above on feli/felis.  This *really* needs to be sorted out.

Given Europe's current position, I would say that the Glosa-1000 baseline needs
to be done quite soon (within the next year?).

The word "copyright" confuses newcomers and puts them off.

    I heartily agree.  However, the few attempts I made to exchange some
emails with them were hardly successful.  I got the impression that they
just are not comfortable with this medium of communication.  Also, I am
not certain of the telephone and internet hookup situation in the UK,
but I have the impression that it may be more expensive than in the US
or some other countries, so that they may consider email too much of a
pinch financially.

    Still, without their participation, things are a little nebulous.  I
honestly do not know what their attitude is toward discussions such as
go on here on Glosalist.  Nor do I have any idea what their position is
with respect to proposed "shifts" (to avoid the word "changes") with
regard to Glosa.

    Again, I heartily agree.  I once, quite some time ago, exchanged two
regular mail letters in Glosa with a man in China who said he did not
really know English (and I have no Chinese), and the communication
seemed to go well enough.  The feedback from non-Indo-European speakers
would be very useful.  There may be something of a division of labor
between those on the 'net and those not.  Such a state of affairs might
or might not bode well, depending on one's approach to things.

    Robin Gaskell, you seem to have the most contact with Richmond.  Do
you have any way of sounding out their attitude toward what goes on
here?

    As for size, my approach has been that the basic vocabulary should
be of manageable size and that something like "6000" should be used
sparingly if at all.  After all, if all you know is "1600" (or whatever
the size is) and I start throwing out words from "6000," we will have a
communication problem, the very thing Glosa is supposed to help avoid.

    Again, I concur with your position regarding changes.  In my mind
the question is whether Glosa was more or less baselined in 1992 (or
whenever).  I myself do not think that the 1992 publications should be
considered a baseline for the simple reason that they are not consistent
among themselves!  The terminal-vowel issue needs to be cleaned up, as
does the problem with two Glosa words (one Greek, one Latin) for the
same thing.  If you learn A and I learn B, we still have a communication
problem.

    And, of course, my position is that the base vocabulary selection
needs to be improved.  Once these matters are taken care of, I opine
that things need to be stabilized.  One problem, however, will be those
people not on the 'net who are already using the older materials.

> Who makes the changes?  Well, maybe it should be for voting on Glosalist?
> Newcomers like me could propose, but could not vote.

    I would say that Glosalist is too small a sample of potential or
actual users to be authoritative.  Consultative, maybe.  Also, as I see
it, there is still the issue of what G.E.O. might think about things.
To me this is a *big* bugaboo.

    A secondary issue is presentation.  At one time I faulted the
"Mechanics of Glosa" approach of isolated paradigmatic sentences.  I
have ameliorated my position on that somewhat if the approach were
expanded to include blocks of connected text which would show that it
simply is not necessary to mark everything under the sun all the time
(such as noun markers for plurality, and aspect and tense markers on
verbs), as some people seem to want to do.  Non-Indo-European-native
users of Glosa might not do so, and others had better get used to not
being swamped with redundant markers.  Some connected text could
demonstrate this in the "Mechanics of Glosa."

    As I mentioned, my personal position is that 'vi' is not
particularly a problem, as I see Glosa for use by potentially everybody,
including by those for whom there would not be a collision issue.  I
would hope that things do not fall apart on small matters which do not
even seem important to some.  And again, Glosalist is hardly the entire
Glosa community, such as it is.  All in all, I think myself that all
that is needful, apart from better presentation (including in many more
languages), is cleanup of the terminal vowel problem, abolition of
synonyms, and a better selection of base vocabulary, and that enough
"raw material" is already available.  I would leave basic constructs
such as the pronoun system alone, although if I were going to do more in
depth I would accept whatever changes officially or quasi-officially
come about.

    Yes, the current publications are inconsistent among themselves, and
this is a severe problem, in my opinion.  Is 'X' this, that, or
something else?  I know that Robin has made the point that Ashby & Clark
did the best they could in pre-computer days, doing things by hand on a
shoestring budget.  I grant that.  It is also highly irrelevant what
their personal circumstances were then or are now.  The "interlanguage
marketplace" does not know or care about the personal circumstances of
Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby.  Sorry, but that's the blunt and unkind
truth.  What is important is the product, not the manufacturer.  If
Glosa is to remain tied to the personal fortunes in life of Ashby &
Clark, it will die.  If they don't let go of it, it will die.  Period.

    When I worked up the WWW pages that got their approval, insofar as
possible I did not try to impose my own ideas on Glosa, except that I
almost had to make a selection here and their on the terminal vowel
issue.

    As for a web address with the current stuff, I can foresee the
possibility that some people might balk for the very reason that so many
Glosa-pe simply do not have computer access.

    Yes, all these word-ending problems definitely need to be fixed, in
my opinion also.  I really think it is not so important whether "cat" is
'felis' or 'feli' or whether "you" (plural) is 'vi' or 'vu'.  What is
important is that they be something _consistently_agreed_upon_.

    I'm not sure just what you mean by "Europe's current position."
However, I do think that the basic vocabulary does need to be baselined
or re-baselined fairly soon (whenever that is).  As it currently is, I
am skeptical that Glosa would find much acceptance on a quasi-official
or official level in something like the EU.

    True.  Is it desired that Glosa be spread as a sincerely-proposed
medium of communication, or is it to be milked as a cash cow under the
guise of copyright protection?  Zamenhof deliberately and explicitly
disclaimed copyright for Esperanto and placed it in the public domain,
even though he remained the primary exemplar of good Esperanto usage.
Very wise decision, in my estimation.

+++++++

    A few final comments.  I admit that at present I have no real
commitment to Glosa or to any other conIAL.  At one time, I thought that
I was pulling out of the auxlang wars and placing my bet on Esperanto.
In the end, I came back, so to speak.  As someone pointed out just
within the last few days on the AUXLANG list, getting involved with
auxlangs can be fun, even if one does not become proficient in _any_ of
them.  That is more or less my situation currently.  Although my remarks
about Glosa are sincere, I have never sat down really to learn it and
use it.  Perhaps others have the attitude, as I do, that it is just not
yet in a sufficiently stable state in order to induce me to put much
effort into it.  (And I note that nearly all the posts on Glosalist are
in English.  I would have a hard time putting all this into Glosa
myself.)

I've been working, slowly, time permitting, to resolve issues such as
this. I've created a Glosa sourcefile based on the Glosa 6000 scanned
by Robin, and a makefile to rebuild the dictionaries whenever I update
the source. See http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm.

I've been working, slowly, time permitting, to resolve issues such as
this. I've created a Glosa sourcefile based on the Glosa 6000 scanned
by Robin, and a makefile to rebuild the dictionaries whenever I update
the source. See http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm.

I asked Majordomo for an index and found that there are no files
available for GLOSALIST. I'm not sure how that works; is it a
manual operation of some sort? Anyway, I've kept all the messages
since the early days last year, so if anybody's interested, I can
forward this information. And/or start an archive site. Each month
is a single file, about 60K/month uncompressed.

vide means seeing (adj), to see (verb), the see-er (noun), and? the act of seeing

ge- reverses the direction of the act,
ge-vide means seen (adj), be seen (verb), the thing seen (noun), and? the act of being

    I have had a chance to look at these web pages.  A couple of
observations.

    First, I was totally unable to download the dictionary files.  My
web browser reported that the ftp addresses were badly formed.  The
format  ftp:ge.exe  or whatever is not an absolute address or even a
relative one, to the best of my meager knowledge.  So I can't take a
look at them.

    Second, I noticed references to the Artificial Languages Basic
Vocabulary, of which I posted word on AUXLANG some time ago.  It is
critically important to be aware that the intention is not that there
be some sort of one-for-one correspondence between this list and the
vocabulary of any given IAL.  Not at all.  The matter is whether a
conIAL has adequate vocabulary to express what this list expresses, and
NOT that it necessarily have as many words.  In fact, not having as
many words by literal count may come to be an advantage if it is
workable.  This list arose in an English context, and nothing says that
any conIAL has to be merely a relexification of English.

+++++

    In the last few days, in a somewhat disjointed fashion, I have
offered a few thoughts about the state of Glosa and what it needs in 
my estimation.  I thought I would try to set those out a little more
consistently.

    1) Resolution of the word-termination confusion.  In some
instances, the same Glosa word for a single concept has different
terminal vowels (or occasionally consonant/vowel alternation) in
different G.E.O. publications.  In other instances, two different Glosa
words for different concepts differ only by their terminal vowels. 
This state of affairs involves confusion and needs badly to be
rectified so that word endings are consistent.

    2) Abolition of synonyms.  In some instances, a given concept has
two Glosa words, one from Latin and one from Greek.  This synonymy
should be abolished.  If Person 1 learns word A and Person 2 learns
word B, they still cannot communicate, the very situation Glosa is
supposed to deal with.

    3) More judicious selection of basic vocabulary from existing
materials.  So-called Glosa 1000 does not exist consistently among
G.E.O. publications, and collation of various lists of so-called Glosa
1000 produced a list of 1500 - 1600 words.  (I did not count exactly.)
I do not endorse use of Glosa 6000 for general use.  One of the strong
points of Glosa is limited vocabulary to be learned.  At the same time,
an effective, judiciously-chosen basic vocabulary may well require more
than one thousand words.  There should not be some sort of quasi-
mystical attachment to a list of precisely one thousand words.  If
"Glosa 1000" must become "Glosa 1500" or whatever for a more effective
vocabulary, then so be it.

    4) Enhancement of the "Mechanics of Glosa" to include connected
samples of text.  It is true that children do not learn their native
tongues from grammar books.  But neither do they learn divorced from a
context.  They receive feedback, both verbal and nonverbal, from their
elders.  The present "Mechanics of Glosa" consists of context-free
paradigmatic sentences which cannot exemplify the necessary feedback. 
Therefore, potential learners do not know that it is not necessary
always to mark verbs for tense and aspect or nouns for plurality. 
Provision of exemplary samples of connected text would provide much
needed enhancement of the "Mechanics of Glosa."

    5) Resolution of how and by whom enhancements and vocabulary
adjustments can occur.

Paul                             <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

Interesting. That should be sufficient, and I know it used to work when
I had Internet Explorer 2 because I use it on other, older pages. But it
doesn't seem to work for me now, using IE3. My new configuration, or lack
thereof, I suspect. When no path is given in a URL, the browser is supposed
to use the current directory as the default path.

Aaron was able to download, but got an illegal operation when he tried to
execute it. We're looking into that. It works for me, honest!

Anyway, give it another shot. I've created four links for each file;
both selfextracting and regular zipfiles, via ftp and http for each.
I noticed that when I slide my pointer over the http links, the URL
shown at the bottom *does* show the complete path, even though I'm
not giving it in the link. But it does not show the complete path for
the ftp: version. Right now, I don't know if IE has changed or my
configuration needs work.

The htp:program.zip links worked for me. If you've got pkunzip, you
should probably try those first. If not, I'll be glad to email the
files. But I do want to figure out what's going on here! Thanks for
letting me know of the problem.

Understood. I do mention some considerations of that sort on the page,
synonyms and such, and Glosa combinations that might have the relevant
meanings. No es problema!

I think I'll probably need to make another synonym pass through the
sourcefile. In the simpler dictionaries I've eliminated the Glosa
words that were synonyms for a given English word in the file, but
I didn't explicitly look for English synonyms in the file, though I
did handle them when I noticed them. For example, if Glosa1 and Glosa2
mapped to English1, and Glosa3 and Glosa4 to English2, then I would
have eliminated one of each of those Glosa words. But what if English1
and English2 were themselves synonyms? Then we would be left with just
one Glosa word.

    Just a word.  Nut$crape and Internut Exploder are NOTORIOUS for not
following international standards.  They seem to think that they are
above the rules.  Not everybody uses them, believe it or not.  Because
they are notoriously unreliable in this regard, I think that the safest
thing is always to give absolute addresses, even though it is more
work.  Even so, I downloaded the actual HTML source to the pages, and I
still don't think that something like  http:eg.exe  is a valid format
according to standard.  Don't you want something more like an href=
link within an anchor?  I admit I have never even _heard_ of anything
like http:eg.exe.  (Of course, there are lots of things I have never
heard of.)

    Just to clarify, what I was referring to were such pairs as
kosmo/universa, strata/via, helio/sola, krepita/susura, and many, 
many more, with both members of a pair standing for the same thing.  
In my own humble opinion, these sorts of pairs should be abolished
unmercifully.

> I think that the safest thing is always to give absolute addresses

In a way I agree with you, and if you were to examine all my html sources
you'd find that some of my main links are absolute. The argument *for*
relative addresses is not just that it's less work, but also less chance
for error if you relocate pages to another directory or machine. Also,
since I develop on my home machine and then upload to my ISP, I wouldn't
be able to test on my local machine unless I converted all the absolutes
to relatives for testing, made my changes, then converted back before
uploading. (Hmmm. Perhaps I could write a script to do that for me. Hmmm.)
But not too long ago I realized something that argues strongly *against*
relative addresses: if *you* download my page, the links will point to
*your* machine and *your* directory, and the other files won't be there
unless you downloaded all of them too! And you won't be able to get back
to one of my pages by clicking on one of my links anymore.

(Oh, the agony and the ecstacy of relative addressing. As usual, a middle
way, a bit of both, is probably the best way; but right now I'm just a bit
too far over on the side of relativity.)

So one thing I did a month or so ago was change all the back-to-my-homepage
links (and a few others) to absolute so that if anybody really wanted to
find me again, there'd be at least one clue on each page!

Tee hee hee!

But here's why it works. Consider the full link:

   <a href="http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/eg.exe">

If the file is on the local machine, you can remove the machine name:

   <a href="http:/~ailanto/eg.exe">

And if it's in the current directory, you can remove the directory part:

   <a href="http:eg.exe">

You could use relative directory paths too. Some people like to keep their
images in a subdirectory, so you'll see something like:

   <img src="images/picture.gif">

And if you really want to make something ugly, you could back up a level:

   <img src="../images/picture.gif">

It's really just a historical Unix convention.

Tee hee hee!

But here's why it works. Consider the full link:

   <a href="http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/eg.exe">

If the file is on the local machine, you can remove the machine name:

   <a href="http:/~ailanto/eg.exe">

And if it's in the current directory, you can remove the directory part:

   <a href="http:eg.exe">

You could use relative directory paths too. Some people like to keep their
images in a subdirectory, so you'll see something like:

   <img src="images/picture.gif">

And if you really want to make something ugly, you could back up a level:

   <img src="../images/picture.gif">

It's really just a historical Unix convention.

*	The Glosa authors do know about the Glosalist: I discussed it with them
before attempting to set it up; periodically, I redirect messages and "Cc:"
postings to them (as I am this one); and they noted appreciation for my
report on the List, in Glosa, for publication in Plu Glosa Nota.
	The question of changes is 'interesting.'  Most changes are at the
applications development level, not at the fundamental vocabulary level,
but democracy should more-or-less apply.  If everyone was Networked, we
could say: "Listen guys, from midnight 30th May, the 2nd Person Plural
pronoun is "vu" not "vi". OK. Please change this in your memory banks,
thank you."
	The question of our getting together, mounting a case for "vu" against
"vi", and deliberating on it is not the stumbling block.  In the Glosa
set-up, we are more or less paper-based, and many people have some fairly
ancient copies of the Glosa 1000 list.  Inertia is the main problem:
we would have to tell all of our widely and thinly spread Glosa-pe about
the change .. and 'pidgeon postage' is one of the killer costs for the
authors.  As well as that, when dictionaries are reprinted, then retooling
is needed so that new dictionaries carry the revision(s) - they are printed
by a Printer.
	Perhaps we can get the authors to change over to in-house publishing,
where they would have considerably more control over their 
vocabulary databases.  Disadvantages of this idea are: the cost of a good
printer; labour requirements of the authors in printing, collating and
binding; and the loss of professional finish on dictionaries.
	I have invited Ron Clarke and Wendy Ashby to subscribe to the Glosalist,
but their decision to be off the List is basically an economic one: the
language reform business does not pay well.  Were I more economically
astute, I would offer to subsidise their Net payments, but, sadly, I think
better than I play economics.

*	A good case here for the delegation of authority: I was writing to
Chinese and African Glosa-pe, before I started trawling the Net for other
affluents to help with the correspondence.  We are looking for people to do
'disinterested' research by using Glosa to write to such non-English-based
learners.

*	So far discussion on the Glosalist confirms belief in the need for a
learners' dictionary somewhere between the 1000-word and 6000-word sizes:
Paul Bartlett suggests around 1600 to 1800, and I feel it would grow to
about 2000.
	Almost all changes, so far, have been made by the authors: '81 to '92 was
marked by regular gradual change, but the '92 "Glosa 6000" stabalised the
language.  This dictionary now needs recasting and reprinting to iron out
inconsistencies - but, again, this is an economic challenge.  In a reprint,
the slight change of spelling of a pronoun could occur, but the authors
would need to be convinced of the linguistic superiority of the new form.
I don't know why "vi" was chosen: perhaps "vu" was reserved for another
lexeme; does "vu" 'feel' better in the spoken language .. I haven't had
time to test it.

*	Over the development of Glosa 1972 - 98, the 'voting' style of democracy
was not the mode.  The authors have kept a fairly strong hold on the
language; however, changes in the use of the language by others have come
from just that: usage.  While most users of Glosa, now and in the future,
could live with either "vi" or "vu", I suggest that you write to the
authors, directly, detailing your case for a change.
	Concerning the "List/community," numerically the Glosalist is a distinct
minority: were we called upon to field a team of Glosa speakers to-morrow,
we would have to fly in the Ugandans; I would volunteer to be twelfth man.
Academically, Linguistically and technologically the Glosalist has
considerable weight, but I can understand the great 
significance for the authors of creating a group that is fluent in the use
of the language - as it stands.

*	This is why I value your contribution.  While I appreciate the existence
if both singular and plural 2nd Person pronouns in Glosa, my evaluation of
them has been .. in the mouth.  One thought is that the present "vi" not
only translates into Eng. 'you', it also represents Eng. 'your' and
'yours'.  When I write Glosa, I always listen, as well, for the sounds of
the words - in my head: "vi" has 'sounded good' so far, so I, personally,
would have to give the same test to "vu", before I could say what I thought
about the proposed change.

*	Apologies from me re "felis": this is Old Glosa, and I sometimes lapse
into it.  The 'brevo' form "feli" is in the "Glosa 6000" dictionary, and
this, for obvious reasons, is the version I should choose.  The rendition
of Eng. 'science' into Glosa has had a more chequered history: the authors
have experimented with different ways, including the English-lookalike
"science."  It never was "cience": your 1000-word list could carry a typo;
"Glosa 6000" ('92) shows "skience" and this, uncritically, is good enough
for me.  From my perspective in the promotion of Glosa, there are more
critical battles than a skirmish around the spelling of one particular word.
	However, you do deserve to have my understandings on this situation: in
Glosa, there exists a triangle with Classical-root-word,
one-sound-per-letter, and best-sound at its apices; in matching all these
factors, sometimes a compromise has had to be made to produce the best 
spelling/pronunciation combination; the English-language concept 'science'
has tested this triangular word-formation process.
	Now, with "ski" = 'know, knowing, knowlege', we have the *process of
gaining knowlege* as "ski(-)ence".  I don't know about the credentials of
the "-ence" part, but it is cognate with the Old Glosa "esce" = 'become'.
However, "eske", the current synonym of "gene" (= 'become'), is not in
"Glosa 6000"; so, I simply see the word "skience" as the best result of the
triangualar compromise.  But, pronouncing it is a different story.
Taking Glosa's one-letter-one-sound semi-phonetic pronunciation, and
applying standard Italian pronunciation to the vowels, standard European
pronunciation to the consonants .. and the special Glosa extension of the
Italian -ci- and -ce- pronunciations to all -cVOWEL- combinations .. we
render the phonics, in crude Gaskell symbols, as  skEE'AYn'CH-AY .
	[Note: Use of these phonic symbols is not for the feint-hearted, but, sure
as hell, it is a lot easier than the International Phonetic Alphabet, as
used by the Collins Cobuild dictionaries.  I do not use such symbols for
normal Glosa teaching: I would rather buy a cheap cassette player and send
it with a cassette of spoken Glosa, than expect people to fight their way
through any phonetic/phonic system.]

*	You see "vi" and "su" as *errors* because they are opposite usages to
those in some natlangs, and "gnata" in *error* because of its difficult
initial consonant combination.  Nice to see someone else come out and say a
language has "faults": I was jumped on when I said Esperanto had 'design
faults.'
	I am not going further on "vi", but I would say that in "su" we have
another 'brevo' form derived from Old Glosa: "supra" (= above) is O.G.
directly from the Latin dictionary, thus with impeccable credentials.  Once
we had "sur" = 'on' O.G., derived from Latin words for `over` and `up`:
with French having ~sous~ = 'under' and ~sur~ = 'on', can I be Politically
Correct and suggest that, perhaps, in this case, French is **at fault**?
Maybe not; Alliance Francaise would never hear of it.  So, taking the
French language as a 'given,' perhaps the abbreviation of "supra" to "su"
is unwise, even if it does deliver a shorter function word. 
	An initial "gn-" is 'transliterated' from the Greek, and, as such is
awkward to the ears of people speaking softer languages: possibly, in such
cases, the Latin synonym would be more suitable.

*	Nice to hear.  I guess that subscribers to this List should do a revised
Introductory Dictionary for presentation to the authors.  One of the strong
considerations behind preparation of a short starter vocabulary is cost -
both of production and postage.  When the authors get a request for more
information about Glosa, they do wish to send a wordlist to the enquirer,
but the expense of satisfying each request must be debited against Glosa
Education Organisation funds.  So, any upwards revision of the starter
dictionary must be, rationally, within the G.E.O. budget.

*	Quite so.  I understand that the Authors believe the language to be
reasonably stabalised, if not 'baselined', at the 1000-word and 6000-word
levels, already.  A dialogue with the authors on an extension and revision
of the shorter list seems like a good idea.  It would be easier to regulate
with low-cost, in-house printing; however, the reality is a paper-based
production and clientelle.  Maybe, with the technological resouces of those
on this List, we could help the authors innovate electronic management of
these dictionaries.  I failed to export moribund electronic equipment to
Uganda, because of import duties; but, no such opposition prevents our
providing the authors, in England, with a moribund Letter Quality printer
for their IBM clone system.  Any offers?

With, much of their income from dictionary sales, the authors are loath to
release the "Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Net.  Can we, as a 'think tank'
come up with a formula that permits electronic management of the lexicon so
that as well as ensuring, and hopefully, increasing, the authors' income

	Aaron, as a 'newcomer at the Glosalist level, you are seeing Glosa from a
very different viewpoint from most Glosa-pe.  The bulk of present Glosa-pe
is off the Net, so comments of "copyright" on this list, and in Webpages
does not reach them.  However, all Internet savvy people understand the
concept of "Shareware", which incorporates the copyright idea, so provision
of a "Glosa 2000" as Shareware would .. theoretically .. 
protect the authors' copyright.
	Since you were sensible enough to provide your Land Address, I can send
you the scanned (and reversed) version of "Glosa 6000", on disk.  By
sending the Glosa->English and English->Glosa lists off the Net, we give
you an electronically usable form of the dictionaries.  While avoiding
global publishing, this provides a very limited circulation to List
subscribers only.  However, I would like to be able to offer a Shareware
version of the dictionaries over the Internet: is there a way we can
convince the authors that such a ploy would result in increased sales of
printed dictionaries?

Karo plu Glosa-pe!

I wish to second the major (and minor) points that Robin makes:
	1. Glosa is still appropriately under the management of Ron and 
Wendy, who are, by the way, very reasonable folk, in my opinion and 
experience.  Any changes in G should proceed from GEO.
	2. It is perhaps reasonable to change VI to VU, although I would 
need to see a strong argument in its favor.  The fact that French, for 
example, suggests 'vu' could lead to all sorts of changes -- this has 
happened historically in Esperanto with no appreciably helpful results.  
Still, any such change would have economic costs (for R&W) and I would 
question its worth.
	3. It is true that languages evolve, but usually from a rather 
substantial base, and I am not totally sold that that basis has been set 
up yet.  For example, I still would like to see a more descriptive 
grammar, in the sense of 'rules,' developped, so that all can agree on 
syntax.  Not to overstate my case, I agree fully that G has no grammar in 
the sense of accidence (declensions, etc.), but it relies heavily on 
syntax (the order and placement of words and particles), and this needs 
exploration.  In any case, change proceeds really quite slowly.
	4. I really wish that the Ugandans and Chinese and others could 
participate in these discussions.  The charge has been levelled against G 
that it is relexified English, and without the viewpoints of 
non-anglophones, it is quite hard to gainsay that.
	5. I know that R&W are not on Glosalist for financial reasons, 
but this is really a shame, since it allows for a potential split; I do 
not want such a thing to happen.  I for one would be glad to contribute 
to a fund to subsidize their participation.  Anyone want to join me?  
Robin could manage it -- I have a hard time sending funds to England.
	Enough!  But thanks for perusing this.

    I will respond to a few points here and there of Robin's post.  I

Then I will try to be quiet.  At the same time, I do think that general
agreement is more important than getting my own way.  It's just that I

On Sun, 31 May 1998, Robin Gaskell wrote (excerpted):

    Definitely.  However, as some of the Esperantists have point out,
"action" in Esperanto on the 'net is only a tiny portion of real-world
Esperanto usage.  Proabaly something similar applies to Glosa, even
with a much, much smaller user base.  Those of us who are hooked on the
'net have to realize this.

    Again, and again, and yet again, there simply is no one "Glosa
1000" list.  I have different, "official" copyrighted "Glosa 1000"
lists from G.E.O., and they simply do not agree among themselves.  In
the few copies of Plu Glosa Nota that I read, I noticed that the
authors themselves used words which were not in any "Glosa 1000" list
avaiable to me.

    This is admittendly a problem, but it may not be insurmountable. 
If there were to be a new, more or less standardized vocabulary built
out of existing materials, chances are that usage could smooth the way
with those who do not have it.

    Propagation on Glosa must not be dependent on the finances of
Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark.  Advocates of other auxiliary languages seem
to have realized this long ago.  Consider Schleyer versus Zamenhof.

    Same point.  However, again I remain unsure what is their reaction
to the activity that goes on on this list.  Robin, you seem to have the
most and closest contact with G.E.O.  Do you _really_ know how they
regard such things as standardizing word terminals, abolition of
synonyms, and base vocabulary selection?  Are they going to stand in
the way of putting things like this on the 'net?  I certainly hope not,
because if they try to pull a Schleyer (or a Leslie Jones), Glosa is
headed for deep, deep water.

    I would be seriously interested in how you dealt with the
inconsistent vocabulary problem.

    But if there is a "learners' dictionary" and other people go off
using using a large vocabulary, communication quickly breaks down,
reinstituting the condition that an auxlang is supposed of take care
of.  Some pidgin languages get along with a very modest vocabulary. 
One of Glosa's selling points is that it should not be necessary to
master a large vocabulary.  I could be wrong, but I think that the
basic vocabulary of Lojban, of all things, is in the low thousands.  It
should be fairly obvious by now that I do not approve of general use of
Glosa 6000.  Frankly, I personally am not interested in wrestling with
that size of vocabulary.

    How could the language be stabilized if it still contains
significant inconsistencies?

    Do they intend to continue to dominate it, as Schleyer did with
Volapük?  Maybe it's just me, but I think that the attitude of
Clark&Ashby to what goes on here is a very serious issue.  Also, are
all publications forever to come out of Richmond, Surrey?  I certainly
am in no position, for instance, to do any publishing, but if G.E.O.
is not only the source of all wisdom but also of all materials, I think
trouble is ahead.  As I mentioned before, the sad but blunt truth is
that the marketplace does not know or care about the personal affairs
of Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark and their finances.  I think this issue
needs to be faced squarely by everybody -- including them.

    Chances are good that no matter how you design an auxlang, somebody
is going to find "faults" with it.  That's why I do not get too worked
over things like 'su' and 'vi'.  (And I do _not_ find 'gnata' hard to
pronounce.)

    I don't think the presentation needs so much to be revised as
merely supplemented with specimens of connected exemplary text.  In the
Basic Reference on the web, I took the paradigmatic sentences right out
of G.E.O. publications.  (Except, as I recall, in some cases I may have
used 'feli' for 'kani'.)  However, I think the base vocabulary issue
needs to be addressed first before the extended text specimens are
composed, and all of the "Mechanics" definitely needs to be restricted
(and corrected) to the provided vocabulary.  It is not so much a matter
of revising anything (except for consistency) as supplementing what is
already there.

    Bill Patterson is doing good work in this regard.

    Why need there be anything beyond a "starter" vocabulary?

    Is no one else willing to put any money into Glosa?  I admit that
I cannot at present, but if no one else is willing to, Glosa is in
something of a dangerous condition.  It MUST not remain tied to the
personal situations of Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby.

> *	Quite so.  I understand that the Authors believe the language to be

    I fear that they are too much taken with some sort of
quasi-mystical significance of a magic one thousand words.  Their own
publications reveal that they themselves have not been able to stick
consistently with a single list of one thousand (or at least, they have
not done so).

    Bad idea, in my opinion.  Greater dissemination of Glosa requires
widest possible dissemination of materials, regardless of whether that
dissemination hits somebody in the pocketbook.  I am not aware thae
Zamenhof got particularly rich off Esperanto.

    I have spoken my piece.  I will try not to belabor the points more.

An excellent idea, a natlang-independent beginner's instruction book.
And a number of good ideas for the implementation. I have one suggestion
which though violating the purity of the idea might make it more easily
achievable: a small companion booklet in the natlang, something small
and fairly easy to produce, in which particularly troublesome bootstrap
information could be provided. Maybe even just a page to be inserted - it
might go a long way towards simplifying that startup task.

I was wondering about the GEO, and its organization, and the worldwide
distribution of the glosa-pe. Is the A&C address all there is? I mean
physically; not on the Net. But then, on the Net, there's only three
sites I know of, Robin's and Paul's and mine. I have never seen anything
of Glosa in the real world, and if not for Robin's "Glimmering Out" post
on conlang a couple of summers ago, I probably never would have seen his
or Paul's site. (Try doing a websearch for Glosa; you'll find a bazillion
hits, none of which have anything to do with this language we're talking
about, because glosa itself is a pretty common word in the world.)

Somebody needs to do some advertising. On the Net and off.

(Though I do admit that there's really not much presence of any IAL in my
daily world, except for what I put there. I find that very irritating; in
the daily newspaper I can find sports scores from around the world, or
for the smallest team in the most little-known sport in a small town in 
a far-away corner of my state; but I don't think I've seen a real reference
to an IAL since I found the address for ELNA in an Indianapolis newspaper
15 or so years ago!) (Wait a moment, maybe that's an opportunity! Although
several other IALs have the lead, they aren't seen in daily life either.
So if we advertised even just a little bit...) 

Are there national GEO satellite offices? If not, perhaps we should start
some, if that's acceptable. That could alleviate the postage problems for
the GEO, since the national sites could handle the local traffic.

Does anybody know the size of the glosa-pe? And where they're located?

Ooooh! I made a good choice! I just checked my Dictionary Source File,
and sure enough, I had selected "supra" as the preferred synonym. Can't
say that I remember exactly why, but it does seem to me that clarity
is more important that brevity in this case.

Relexification never bothered me. There seems to be a bias in the conlang
community against using any feature of your natlang in your conlang, lest
you be merely relexifying. But if your natlang has a useful feature, why
*not* use it in your conlang? I bet German conlangers accuse each other of
relexifying German, French conlangers French, etc.

However...

Glosa is *not* relexified English. The problem is that we sometimes tend
to write relexified English using Glosa vocabulary, and if that's what the
observers see, then they think that Glosa is relexified English. We must
strive to write Glosa using Glosa grammar (assuming we know what that is),
and write lots, and get it out there where people can see it.

Perhaps. I need to know more. As I said above, I don't know why it's such
a problem. I do know that in Europe connection costs are greater, and aren't
they charged by the minute? But this is a low-traffic list, and they've got
an address. Are they comfortable with computers? Of great importance: can
they work offline, prepare their mail, login and blast it all out and then
logoff. That shouldn't take much actual connect time. I just spent about an
hour and a half responding to various messages, but I'll only be online for
a minute or so sending it out.

I agree with your comments about the two Glosa dictionaries. Why two? For
maximum utility as an IAL, just use the smaller one, and say that's it.
(Maybe also say, if you need a word that's not in here, use the straight
Latin (or Greek), so that readers will know to look in *that* dictionary
for anything they can't find in the Glosa dictionary.) Or just use the
bigger one and admit that Glosa has a large vocabulary but it's a darn
good IAL vocabulary. 

Given that the vocabulary is large, I can understand the need for a
slimmed-down version for beginners. But if that slimmed-down version
is too slim, we're all going to be using the 6000 anyway. And there will
always be beginners using the 1000 and missing many of the words being
used by us oldtimers with the 6000. So why not choose the middle path and
come up with just one standard dictionary, larger than the small one but
smaller than the large one, and complete in itself?

(Or perhaps the 1000 *is* the real-life "shareware" version, and the
omissions are the incentive to purchase the full version?)

Just omitting synonyms can slim it down quite a bit. It can be further
slimmed by omitting the extra unique words. For example, we have VERNA
and PRIMAVERA for Springtime; omit one of these synonyms. But actually,
these are not just synonyms, but extra unique words, because the official
Glosa word is BLASTO-TEM. Blasto-tem isn't as recognizable as the others,
but that's just the downside of agglutination. By learning that BLASTO is
bud/germinate, and TEM is time/period, and that BLASTO-TEM is the phrase
for Springtime, we can cut down the vocabulary considerably.

I hate to give up too many words, but perhaps a well-selected Glosa 2000
or 3000 is what we really need.

    I did once get a couple of emails from Ron Clark.  To be honest,
there were almost unreadable, as if he didn't really know how to use a
computer.  (They didn't even understand what a spell-checker is for.)
As for expenses, I am not aware of their situation -- or what the 'net

    This is a legitimate point.  "Relexification" is sometimes used as
a stick to beat things with.  I have fallen into that myself from time
to time.  And I agree that Glosa is not strictly relexified English (at
least, it doens't have to be).

    I think not.  See above.

    Robin would know better, but I think that the Glosa Education

    I feel quite strongly about Glosa having only a modest vocabulary. 
However, over the last few days I have said what I think needs to be
said, and I won't beat it into the ground.

    I have read the claim that Tok Pisin is used in the parliament of
Papua New Guinea, and it probably has a relatively modest word-store
apart from proper names and specialist terminology (and I don't even
know about this latter).

> I hate to give up too many words, but perhaps a well-selected Glosa 2000

    My estimate, as before, is 1600 - 1800 words.  However, actual
experience is a better guide that SWAGs and hunches.

    I admit that I have not really "committed" myself to Glosa (or to
any other IAL), and I have not used it a lot.  One frustration for me
was the very vocabulary situation I have referred to.  I have just
thought that things were insufficiently well defined, so I hazve been
reluctant to put a lot into it.  However, it remains so that the most
valuable and most legitimate criticism comes from actual users and not
from armchair critics.

Hurrah! 

Both Aaron and Paul had trouble downloading my dictionary files. And then,
coincidentally, the same weekend, I got an email from somebody who had been
unable to download my Doom files.

I had the links defined like this...

   href="ftp:filename.exe"


...which should have worked. It did before! And it is the proper
format, and I have some much older pages which use it. But sure
enough, it didn't work for me anymore either! I've "upgraded" (yeah,
right, "upgraded", teeheehee) my browser since then. Well, the ftp:
is *supposed* to tell the browser to download the file. But nowadays
broswers are also likely to check the file extension and try to decide
for themselves what to do, no matter what you tell them.

Actually, the ftp: form does work for .zip files. In fact, just about
any combination worked for zips. The exe files were the problem. At home
I use Internet Explorer 3, and at work Netscape Navigator. Also at work
we have Internet Explorer 2. And I could not find a combination of things
that would work for all three! I kept thinking that it must be an improper
configuration.

But the fault may actually be with my ISP. Today I found an exe file, a
self-extracting file, at the garbo site in Finland, and the link was defined
exactly like my original version. And it worked just fine! So I moved the
files over to my site on xoom.com along with a test page using the original
links, and it worked!

So I left the files on xoom and linked to them there. If anybody wants
to try the new version, let me know how it goes.

BKZIP? Tell me more! Are you familiar with INFOZIP? It's a freeware
project that's compatible with pkzip (although the commandline switches
are a little bit different, and it saves/restores directory structures
by default (opposite of pkzip) ), but what's really cool is that it runs
under many different operating systems. Handy for me, because I use
DOS/WINDOWS/NT and Unix.

    Thanks for the reference.  Although, as you mentioned, the
Glosa reference was not precisely on target, it was at least
not too bad.  I noticed that there was a reference to
Jeffrey(sp?) Henning's Model Languages page.  I had not looked
at it in a long time, and I see that he has a link to frater2,
a project I was once working on but have done nothing with in a
long time.  It was a modification of FRATER, a somewhat
Glosa-like language by a Vietnamese, published in 1957:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/frater2.html

(I never got around to finishing the vocabulary.  I did quite a
bit in the language description, however.)

While you are ^juggling^ the Glosa words in your head, re-arrange them so
that ^when they fall^, they produce well-formed Glosa sentences.  The
situation becomes rather unworkable when you think in English, compose
satisfatory sentences in English, and then procede to translate these
English-language originals into Glosa.
	The Glosa authors welcome items for the periodical "Plu Glosa Nota"  from
beginners, and they will happily edit such articles into good Glosa.
Netters should send items to  glosauk{at}cix{dot}compulink{dot}co{dot}uk  .
	To recieve a sample copy of P.G.N. send your pidgeon post details to the
authors, and they will forward you one: unfortunately, they wish normal
commercial conditions to apply, and they need to get a subscription to the
periodical to be able to send out further copies.

*	Hi Aaron,
I will agree that written Glosa gets more attention than the spoken form,
but the way the Glosa pronunciation was arrived at, possibly needs some
explanation.
	In a word, the authors went Italian.  At least as far as the vowels go,
they said the five vowels of Glosa had the same five pronunciations as the
vowels of Italian.  And for "C", they carried the trend, in Italian, for
"-ci-" and "-ce-" to have the English "ch" sound, on to the othe vowels.  I
hope you can follow their logic on this: all "cVOWEL" forms in Glosa have
the "c" pronounced as "ch" in English.  
	I went to my local library to borrow a "teach yourself Italian" cassette
to check out my Glosa pronunciation against that on the cassette. This
would be the most practical way of getting the Glosa vowels.  When Ron
Clark was teaching me the A, E, I, O, U of Italian, I was struck by the
fact that the last two vowels were formed differently from their normal
soundings in English: for both "O" and "U", he projected his lips forward
in a rather non-English sort of way.

>is "o" a pure short o, or does it really have an r!  any hint of a "w"
>sound?
*	When you say, "Pass me some more bread," you do not actually sound the
"R" in the "-ore", but it is 'felt.'  This is the "o" of Italian and Glosa.
 There is no "w" hinted.

>is "e" a pure e (like Esperanto) or is it diphthongised (like English)?
*	Neither.  The "e" of Italian and Glosa sound like the long "A" of
English, which is a diphthongised "a": hence my rendition of it as "AY".

>is "j" always like 'you' never like 'jet'?
*	True.  I wonder if something significant has been lost with the absence
of the 'hard "J"' which I see also as the 'soft"G"'.

>is "y" really used in modern Glosa, or does "i" always replace it?
*	It was originally there, but now has been completely replaced by "I";
this represents a standardisation.

>is "x" always ks, for example is xilo always like ksilo never like zilo?
*	The semi-phoneticisation in Glosa has each letter with only one
pronunciation: Glosa "x" and "z" being different letters have different
pronunciations .. one each!  Yes, the Glosa "x" is pronounced as "ks'.

>is "z" a voiced "s" (the international value) or is it "ts" or is it
>"dz"?
*	I'd go for the 'international' voiced "s"'.  But it is so rare in Glosa
that I use it very infrequently.  

>are diphthongs really avoided in practice (for example is auxi always
>a-oo-ksi or does aubreve-ksi creep in)?
>another example, is baia always ba-ee-a or does ba-ya occur?
*	Very tricky question.  Having adjacent vowels is purposely avoided in
Glosa, where possible.  Each vowel is supposed to be sounded separately,
according to the rule of Glosa's semi-phoneticisation.  But people are
people, and will take short cuts: what is the shortest distance between two
vowels?
	In the two examples you gave, classical Glosa gives each vowel its own
pronunciation.  Using Gaskell symbols, they are: AH-OO'ksEE and bAH-EE-AH.

	I understand that the authors sell a demonstration cassette of spoken
Glosa: I have threatened to create a set of conversation cassettes, but am
moving very slowly on the plan.

quite different, like Esperanto's "ri", would be a better bet.  However, in
English we have muddled through for centuries without this pronoun; it is
only now, with Political Correctness, that "he/she" or "heesh" has been
foist upon us, but still there is no "him/her" or "hir".  Obviously Glosa
could have a third person singular pronoun, but this is more likely to be
added at the time of IAL adoption, or afterwards, than as a priority for
the author's promotion of the language.  R.G.

    Correct me if I am wrong, but it has been my understanding from
the very beginning that 'pe' is usable as a sex-neutral pronoun.

    But my complaint, if you will, is that the language is not
consistent enough to induce me to put much effort into it "as it now
exists."  To be sure, we must avoid the trap of "tinkering" and ever
striving for a "perfection" which does not exist.  At the same time,
nearly every constructed auxlang goes through a developmental period. 

    Zamenhof experimented with various schemes before he published
Esperanto in 1887.  Different schemes were worked over before
Interlingua was published in 1951.  Lojban went through development
before it was baselined not too long ago.  There were at least three
editions of Russell's Suma.  And so on.  My position is that if Glosa
has been baselined, then it was so too soon and left with too many
inconsistencies.

    To be sure, there needs to be discerning judgment to decide that a
language is in good enough condition that further adjustment my not be
suitable.  I suppose I may differ in that judgment on the current state
of Glosa.

I came across frater2 some time ago, before I got involved with Glosa,
so the connection with Interglossa/Glosa didn't sink in. I see that you
integrated elements of Interglossa with frater2, and say that frater
is glosalike; was frater itself influenced by Interglossa or was the
similarity coincidental, since the authors of both languages were
approaching the task with similar ideas in mind?

Are there elements of frater and frater2 which could be used to
enhance Glosa?

    The author of FRATER merely said that he was influenced by Bodmer's
"The Loom of Language."  However, Hogben was the "editor" of "The
Loom," and I really don't know how much was Bodmer's and how much
Hogben's.  There was not mention of _direct_ influence from Hogben as
such.

> Are there elements of frater and frater2 which could be used to

    I would tend to doubt it.  I developed the grammar description of
frater2 way beyond that of FRATER, although the latter was the base for
the former.  Also, the grammar of frater2 seems to be much more
elaborate than the implicit grammar of Glosa.  (I did not want to leave
things ambiguous.)  Because both languages have a much more restricted
phonology that Glosa, there is even more deformation of roots than with
Glosa.  At this point I am not really in favor of "changing" Glosa; I
would just like to see more consistency, more optimal word selection,
and better presentation.

At 03:49 PM 5/29/98 +0100, you wrote:
>Saluta a plu Glosa-pe-la,

**	True, I did slip up here.  The correct version is "Id gene ge-vide ex un
andra.".  The English "seen" is a participle: I should have used the
participle form ( ge-vide ) not the infinitive form ( vide ).
*	This is annoyingly the only bit of Glosa that can be described as
"morphological" grammar.  The authors claim that Glosa should be in the
active voice ... but, because some people really need to invoke the
participle, and use the passive voice, then they created the
clumsy-appearing form: " ... gene ge-X .." where "X" is a substantive word
functioning as a verb.

	The glos is something like:-
  ... gene ge-X
     gets got-X-ed  ...... this 'got-X-ed' bit is the (past) participle, IE
functionally an adjectival form modifying the subject of the sentence.
Participles, being what they are, can, in English, have some of the
qualities of an adverb .. modifying "get" in this case (or the "gene" in
Glosa).  However, because I do enjoy using the passive voice - in both
English and Glosa - I decided to go along with this 'exception' to the "in
Glosa, no word is changed for reason of grammar" rule.   [NB The "ge-" of
Glosa is almost equivalent to an "-ed" in English - for participles.]

EG  Un andra vide u kani.  ........  U kani gene ge-vide ex un andra.
..  the man  sees the dog   ......  the dog gets (got)seen by the man 

..  Un andra bate u kani.  ........  U kani gene ge-bate ex un andra.      
..  the man hits the dog  ........  the dog gets (got)hit by the man

..  Fe klude u fenestra.  .........  U fenestra gene ge-klude ex fe.
.. she closes the window  .........  the window gets (got)closed by her

I wish to stress that in Glosa the form is always the same, but in English
we have inherited numerous ways of forming the participle, and it may even
stay the same as the infinitive.  There is always a verb before the
participle: "gene" in Glosa; and "is", "gets", etc in English.

The matter of tense becomes delightfully confused, in English, when we try
to tease out just whose "-ed" it is: sometimes the "-ed" tells us we have a
participle, sometimes it tells us about past tense, and at other time it
covers both.  Obviously, in Glosa, the authors attempted to standardise the
patterns for the formation of both tense and voice. 
    NB We really have tried to avoid translating Glosa word for word from
English, and have sought regularisation within the language.  Having said
all that, it is possible to use the 'glos' form to replace Glosa words with
English ones, and still come up with a fairly meaningful sequence of words.
     
>vide means seeing (adj), to see (verb), the see-er (noun), and? the act of
>seeing (noun),
*	Not so fast.  I think you have the ^tail by the dog^.
Back to basics: in Glosa, WITHIN REASON, the substantive can function as
any part of speech; we could perhaps have "vide andra" [seeing man], "ki
vide id" [goes to see it], "fe vide an" [she sees him], u vide [a/the
see(ing)].  But, perhaps the verb "to see" is one in which it is not
reasonable to force all of the possible functions; maybe there are better
lexemes for these functions, EG "vista" [view], "skope" [look at].
	However, it is rational to think of some concepts as more related to
actions (natural verbs) and others more related to things (natural nouns),
and the same has to be true of Glosa, also.  In English we use "see" more
as a verb than a noun.  The same is true of Glosa: it is natural to think
of "vide" as having more of the qualities of a verb than a noun.  
	So, it is best to start with the infinitive as the 'pure' form of the
verb: "Vide!" (imperative), "An pa ki vide id." [He went to see it.]; but
we can add tense "Fe pa vide id" [She saw it.], "Tosto, un avi fu vide id."
[Soon, the bird will see it.], or "John nu vide id" [John is now seeing
it.], and even "Po vide id, an pa kurso." [After seeing it, he ran.]; but
we can get onto sticky ground when we try for the gerund "Mi amo mi plu
okula, ka mi hedo vide." [I like my eyes because I enjoy seeing.].  As you
can imagine, there is no difference in Glosa between " .. mi hedo vide." [
.. I enjoy seeing.] and " .. mi hedo vide." [ .. I like to see.].

	But, of course, we have *seeing* things in Glosa, too: "An es u vide-pe."
[He is a see-er.] is pushing it a bit, when we would do better to say, "An
es u skope-pe." [He is a watcher.], and "An habe vide" [He is sighted.] or
"An habe un abili de vide." [He has the ability of seeing],
alternatively [He has the ability to see.].  On the other hand we use the
participle form as descriptions of things: "An es u ge-vide persona." and
"An es u ge-vide-pe." both mean either [He is seen.] or [He is the seen
person.] 

>ge- reverses the direction of the act,
*	You are right, but I stress that the reversal is ONLY in relation to the
participants in the sentence, and that the " ge-" specifically denotes that
the following substantive functions as a participle.	
	The action of the substantive 'verb' is still a positive one!
EG  Un andra bate u ju-an epi u buta.  
..  the man hits the boy on the bottom  

.. Epi u buta, u ju-an gene ge-bate ex un andra.
.. on the bottom the boy gets  hit  by the man

	The "ge-bate" is still a positive "hit", even in the passive: the boy
feels the arrival of the hand on his bottom, not the removal of it.
	But, in terms of the actor and recipient, we can say the " ge-" 
indicates a reversal: this is what passive voice is about.

>ge-vide means seen (adj), be seen (verb), the thing seen (noun), and? the
>act of being seen (noun)
*	Honestly, I believe we have a ^cart before the horse^ situation here.  IF
the Glosa construction " ge-" denotes the participle, then the normal
qualities of that 'part of speech' do apply: it acts as a noun modifier
that embodies some active principle, which , usually, has acted in the past.
	"Gene" is a 'form verb' giving us little information about the action
other than its 'direction' IE who does it to whom.  Sometimes "getting" an
object is all the action we need to know about, so, "gene", like "get", can
function as the only verb in a sentence, and would, thus, have the quality
of a substantive.
	"Ge-" is a sort of abbreviation for "gene" [get/got], but makes more sense
as a PARTICIPLE PARTICLE, akin to the "-ed/-en" moiety in English.
	Glosa, being a SV(O) language, needs a full verb in every sentence:
sometimes, as in English, it has only a 'form verb' to occupy the "V" slot;
these are "es", "gene", "habe" and "eqa".  The " ge-" particle does not
function as a 'form verb.'
So, I attemt to answer your question(s) about the meaning of GE-VIDE :-
#>ge-vide means seen (adj),# YES, participles are fundamentally adjectives.
#be seen (verb),# NO, not as an infinitive; but YES to "being seen" as an
adjectival group. 
#the thing seen (noun),# NO, not an elided noun phrase:  .. U GE-VIDE RA is
the full noun phrase; "ra" [thing] is a 'form noun'.
#and? the >act of being seen (noun)# NO, this is asking too much of
language, in general: in Glosa, the participle would need to be part of a
descriptive phrase EG  UN AKTI DE GENE GE-VIDE .

	N.B. If we take the abbreviation process too far, meaning is lost.
Because Glosa works without verb inflections or Part-of-Speech markers, it 
relies, for its semantics, on both syntax and description.  How else, in
English, which has few inflections and only some P-o-S markers, do we say
"the act of being seen" without using  the same number of words that we do
in Glosa: five? 

>so would I be correct in believing that "It is seen by the man." could be
>neatly translated by
>Id ge-vide ex un andra.
>
*	No: too neat.  What you have written translates into English as, "It seen
by the man." which is a non-sentence because it lacks a "V".
	Count the number of words in the compared English and Glosa sentences, and
you will find that there is one less in the Glosa sentence: there is one
word MISSING.  The missing word is the centre part of the SV(O)
prescription: the Glosa 'form verb' "es" [=] is usually reserved to
indicate equivalence; so the 'form verb' "gene" [gets] ^takes the crown^
that you would have "is" ^abdicate^.
	Certainly, in following the English syntax, Glosa has logical phrases and
clauses: " .., ge-vide ex un andra, " is a perfectly legitemate adjectival
phrase, as is its glos in English.
EG
"id, ge-vide ex un andra; qi pa komence voka, pluso skope an, e peti apo."
 it seen by the man flew who started to shout  also saw him   and flew away

>And I suppose,
>An habe pote ge-vide == An pote ge-vide => He can be seen
>
*	Well no.  The types of 'verbs' at work do need more clarification in
Glosa.  "Habe" is more directly involve with the direct act of HAVING, than
is the English equivalent, which get itself caught up in some pretty
complicated usages, which would have had to have had a very interesting
linguistic history.
	In trying to start with a fairly clean slate, we are starting off, in
Glosa, with as few complex linguistic structures as possible.
	"pote" is a member of the 'auxiliary verb' class - in its major function -
as a verb.  These auxiliary verbs precede a substantive verb, and are
(usually) not used alone: "pote", "posi", "sio", "debi", etc.
	Again, your Glosa sentence lacks an effective verb:
"An pote ge-vide." => He can seen.
	In English, "can" {pote} and "seen" {ge-vide} are both 'verbal 
elements', but there is still something missing from the 'verb phrase', and
that is the 'form verb' "be" {gene}.

	So, "An pote gene ge-vide."  =>  He can be seen.  The two sentences have
the same number of words, and both need an effective verb in them.  In
Glosa, we are not slavishly following English, but we are using the
syntactic structures of English ... purely for the reasons that English
syntax is logical, and it is as simplified as it can be, while still
retaining meaning.

    This whole discussion by Robin puzzles me mightily in the matter of
'gene ge-X'.  I will quote only a few excerpts.

    Definitely.  Please see below.

    Why, pray tell, do we need this clumsy construction 'gene ge-X' at
all except to convey a nuance discussed below?  As Robin points out,
'ge-X' functions as a sort of pseudo-inflection or pseudo-agglutination,
the only one in the language.  It forms the rough equivalent of the past
participle, which in bare form in English is really a passive.

    And in English and various other languages, the full passive
construction consists of a passive participle and a copula.  The copula
merely links the "passiveness" of the participle to the subject.  In
short, the copula is all we really need:

        Id es ge-vide ex andra.
          It is seen by a/the man.  ('Un' is unnecessary here, because
          the preposition 'ex' must necessarily be followed by a
          substantive and therefore need not be explicitly marked.)

    The Glosa authors have made this clear:

        ge-lose feli
          lost cat
        Id frakti.
          It beaks/is breaking.
        Id pa frakti.
          It broke.
        ID PA GENE FRAKTI.  (sic! -- NOT ge-frakti!)
          It got broken.
        ID ES GE-FRAKTI.
          It is broken.

Hence, for non-idiomatic pseudo-passives, use 'es ge-X' in place of the
clumsy 'gene ge-X' unless one needs especially to express a nuance.
Even so, the form is NOT 'gene ge-X'.

    I think that here the authors have again allowed themselves to be
mislead by the notorious habits of their native English.  "Get" is one
of those portmanteau words that carries a multitude of meanings, which
they have allowed to sneak into Glosa with a slavish imitation, where
many languages might use separate words for the various meanings.

    Despite its many uses, several of the meanings of "get" can roughly
be summarized under the headings of "become" and "acquire" (although
this is not exhaustive), which many languages may not subsume in a
single word.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the authors have allowed
these meanings to collapse into 'gene' as a counterpart of "get."  Thus,
both "become" and "obtain/acquire" can be rendered by 'gene'.
(Although, to de sure, another rendering of "become" is 'esce'.)  I
think this is unwise and leads to confusion.

    One might say that if the window is broken, it acquires brokenness.
However, there is a subtle nuance of meaning here in English.  If the
window is broken, it is patient.  If it acquires brokenness, it is
agent.  The two situations are not precisely equivalent.  Nevertheless,
in most circustances I would say that most users of English employ a
passive construction to emphasize that the subject is patient rather
than agent.  Consequently, in Glosa we might SEEM to have:

        Id es ge-frakti.
          subject is patient
        Id gene ge-frakti.
          subject is agent

However, the authors have indicated the latter to be simply:

        Id pa gene frakti.  (Depending on the nuance, 'pa' might be
          unnecessary.)

"It gets break." will do for subject-as-agent and "It is broken." for
subject-as-patient.  In this case, I supprt the A&C usage.

    Remember, if we always try to smuggle English usage into Glosa. we
may be doing a disservice to all non-English-speaking potential users.
Why should English be the sole determinant of Glosa usage?  This is
another example of instances in which feedback from non-English-
speaking Glosa-pe would be invaluable.  Unfortunately, as we know, they
are not on the net.

Let me think out loud...

I will use the following notation: (preinterface)notion(postinterface).  Every word in
Glosa (as defined by the dictionary rather than by the ending) is either a notion or a
preposition.  A preposition (without a comma before it) overrides the postinterface of
the preceding notion.  Every notion has a default preinterface as defined by the
dictionary.  The default postinterface is (whole).  The preinterface for the first word
in a sentence is always (context).  The final postinterface in a sentence is always
ignored. A preposition (with a comma before it) ... that's more complex!

Vide and Ge-vide are two different words.  They have the same meaning, but different
interfaces.
(agent)vide(patient)            -> think of the notion of seeing
(patient)ge-vide(whole)      -> think of the notion of seeing


Id vide = Id es vide
-> (context)It(whole) (agent)seeing()
-> It sees (G'i vidas)

Id ge-vide = Id es ge-vide
-> (context)It(whole) (patient)seeing()
-> It is seen (G'i vidig'as)

Id gene ge-vide = Id es gene ge-vide
-> (context)It(whole) gets (patient)seeing()
-> Something starts to look at it, it acquires see-ed-ness (G'i ekvidig'as)

Vide id
-> (context eg: they default:something)Seeing(patient) (whole)it()
-> Something is looking at it / It is seen  (Vidig'as g'i)


Aaron

PS
"Id habe ge-vide" would, I suppose, mean "It has something that is seen"

*	This question does not compute!  A Starter Dictionary" is one used by
someone to LEARN a language - get the right 'feel' for the vocabulary,
understand how words and phrases articulate, get the 'lilt' of the
language, and generally gain confidence in using it.  But the language they
learn to use still remains a 'baby language' at this level.
	Even when writing the Glosa version of the Three Bears, I had to go
outside the 1000 word list for a few of the words.  But, some people will
want to discus politics, others philosophy, and others, again, computers,
etc.  I feel strongly that Glosa needs to have a very clear-cut mechanism
for the development and interleaving of technical vocabularies.  
	But the vocablary that first delivers Glosa to learners (1.5 - 2K) needs
to be friendly and fairly comprehensive to allow light conversation on most
topics.  Paul, do you base your question on any historical precedent - of a
2K language that permits full discussion?

*	Free money or 'venture capital' is not likely to be made available for
anything as 'airy fairy' as another language.  No, we are left with the
human energy of the Ugandans.  I am afraid that the cash economy will do
nothing for Glosa: I am putting my hopes into the world bank of "chi" that
comes from the human will.  I would like to see a 'better' world, and do
use some of my coins to help make it so; but, it is through the projection
of my nervous energy into realising written Glosa on the page, and spoken
Glosa on the cassette tape, that the real "wealth" of Glosa increases.
	I challenge you to name one multinational that would bank-roll Glosa.  Can

*	Originally,that was what they were: I made no serious attempt to think
about what I was doing: cleaning up the scanned Glosa 6000 to English list,
and mechanically 'reversing' the list, to make up a corresponding English
to Glosa 6000 equivalent list, took up all of my brain power.

*	I suspect so.  While compiling a single list from the Glosa 1000 and the
Glosa 6000 lists in the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary, I was aware of
discrepancies, and did make decisions on these - just to get the job done
in a reasonable time.

*	Yes some 'usage phrases' do not sit well in a 'word translation'
dictionary, but, I guess, they should be included.  EG "such a" in English
becomes "u tali" in Glosa: I have uncritically adopted this usage, in the
thought that the authors have done the research, and have selected this
usage for good (enough) etymological reasons.  Had I researched every word
before I used it, I would never have completer "Plu Tri Ursus."

* 	A distinct difference between methodologies emerges.  Knowing that there
were variations between the various 1000-word lists, I chose to use the
lists in the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary as my datum.  And, again, I had to do
some tricky finger-work, because among the three lists in this book (E->G
1000, G->E 1000, G->E 6000) there were differences.
	Rather than add to a "baselined" 1000-word list, I would prefer to prune
from a 6000-word list augmented with selections from Bill's "Omissions"
list.  <I have started looking at these "Omissions.">

*	The problem is in looking at each lexeme and considering its worth:
this is very time-consuming work; Ron Clark was at it for at least a
decade.  Just about all of the words in the various 1000-word lists should
be in a First/Basic/Learners/2K dictionary, but then some horse-trading is
likely to occur over what makes additions to the G.E.O. lists worthwhile or
essential.
	When culling from an augmented 6000-word list, I would aim, on the other
hand, to eliminate words that were not essential to polite tourist
conversation .. or effective pen-friend correspondence.

  My assumption was that the various Glosa

*	How to do it: that is the question.
	I imagine that the creative-anarchistic approach will yield the most
suitable list for global use (but that is just because I am a creative
anarchist); alternatively, we can try distilling a concepts list from the
various research lists about, and decide that the words associated with
these concepts comprise the true 'essential' dictionary.  Ron Clark
actually took the concept list from _Roget's Thesaurus; maybe Roget,
himself, saw something magical in the number "one thousand."

*	Thank you for this comment, Bill.  Yes the companion book(s) would be
worthwhile, and, for some, essential.  Whithin a cultural setting, however,
the more able would intuit the way to make the language work, and 
would explain it in the relevant natlang to others, who are less intuitive.
	I am not so concerned with purity, more with economy of resources and
human effort.  Such a "do it yourself" book would be printable in bulk and,
hopefully, on ASCII-based computer printers, and would be produced without
the G.E.O. group having to learn to translate into, or commission, versions
of Glosa instruction books in the world's myriad tongues.  Where the
expensive effort comes in is in the thinking of the educational ploys to
achieve all of these ends, IE making it work, on the page.

*	Yes, this could be sent with a book to a particular location .. possibly
even a page from a nearby language EG a Spanish Page to a Portuguese.  With
a first contact, we could find a person who knows a language that has been
covered with a 'prompt sheet,' and get them to do an equivalent one for
their culture.
	I am a great believer in the power of the human imagination.
Perhaps the problems are there only to give us something on which to
stretch our minds.
	Anyone attacking the World Language Problem, of course, has decided to
grapple with one of the most challenging of problems.  I do believe that
the best brains should be applied to this problem .. but, they've got us.

globe.  Yes, we should: please write with your plan to the authors.  They
will probably wish to see evidence of proven performance in 
using Glosa before authorising anyone to act on their behalf.
	I am "NSW Agent for Glosa" but do not advertise, nor put out a shingle to
this effect.  Perhaps I should, as you suggest, locate some advertisements
in the local media.  The trouble is that auxiliary languages, as a topic,
are a non-category: no-one wants to accept the concept as being within
their area of interest.  So, OK, this should simply be a provocation to me
to make it into a category.  I possibly have been lazy in not thinking of
this, lately.  When I first returned from the UK ~18 years ago, I did some
advertising and a couple of talks, but this led no-where.  Perhaps it is
time to start again.
	The question of groups is finding a ^shepherd.^  By this I suggest that
starting a group learning an unheard-of language asks a lot, and primarily
calls for an "authority" on the language to watch over the ^flock^ guiding
them through the tricky passes and observing them as they roam the plains.
Questions like "Did I get it right?" need to be answered almost
immediately, to ensure continued progress.  The idea of a correspondence
course with cassettes comes to mind for the reasonably affluent
non-networked group.  The non-affluent, non-networked need a lot more
material help, but, magically, are more self-reliant.  
	Certainly, we should have more satellite centres so that enquirers can be
serviced with the minimum postage cost.  also, if Glosa materials are
stored electronically, they can be printed using a computer printer, on
demand.
	Paul Bartlett points directly to the need for promotional materials in
various national languages.  Somehow these can be produced for electronic
reproduction, so that, for example, a German speaking enquirer can be sent
information through my printing the right file: the one with the  .GER
extension.
	Distribution of Glosa-pe is not circulated as an open list - I think it
should: Imust raise it with the authors that requests have been made for
names and addresses of people to write to.  Most are Post Office addresses,
involving paper, envelopes and postage stamps.

*	Of course it is acceptable, but somehow things have been somewhat
centralised up to now.  I have held stocks of G.E.O. materials in the past,
but stopped sending the ones proclaiming "Glosa has NO GRAMMAR" when I
found this counter-productive.  It would be nice to have stocks of Glosa
materials on hand (or on disk) ready to hand out (or run off).  This would
be especially so, if we could all feel happy that each dictionary with the
same name contained the same words spelt the same way.  Hence the value of
the present work in trying to standardise the vocabulary.

*	 Ron and Wendy should.  But, to date a "Posting List" has not been
circulated.  I have been asked to write to a number of people, and have
done so.  I was writing regularly to the Ugandans, but this is a slow
process, because they have to save up the money to buy stamps.  Maybe we
need to build up a pen-friend system so that people can vie with one
another for the record number of penfriends on their list.  Paul Bartlett
would say, "But is A using the same wordlist as B?" and this is a valid
question.  
	Basically the distribution of Glosa-pe is very dotty, with individuals
showing interest, in ones and twos, very widely separated .. except in
Uganda and at Oak Log Middle School in Atlanta.

the survival of the authors, who are running a fairly centralised,
non-distibuted organisation.  It would be great to have a map of the world
with pins in it showing the locations of the various decentralised Glosa

	The thing that is deceptive is the ease of construction in English: we can
use sloppy syntax all our lives, when speaking English, and not know it.
But, while for Glosa, as in English, the same basic rules of syntax apply,
we will make badly formed Glosa sentences if we use the same sloppy syntax
that we probably would have gotten away with, in English.
N.B. Newcomers to this list might note that in Glosa phrases, the
substantive word, whether verb or noun, comes last: this is described
technically as a 'head final' structure.  Modifiers (adverbs, adjectives,
etc) precede the substantive word they modify.

*	I think that is the main thing: an IAL must be ready to serve its users
in any area of human activity, and, as such, the vocabulary should be
there, available, as needed.  The fact that the full terminology for brain
surgery is not in the standard dictionary, does not suggest that surgeons
should not be able to access a suitable lexicon to talk about such things.
	If people can cover most of their life interests within a 2K lexicon, they
must be living in an intellectual desert.  However, if they can get fluent
in a new language, within 2K, then the two thousand words have served their
purpose.  But, when they want to get into something really interesting,
like a heated discussion on language reform, or they wish to express
themselves interestingly, they will soon discover the limits of a 2K
vocabulary.

I would say that all languages provide their users with increasing levels

	It would be, I feel, honest to say to people that once they master their
first dictionary, or is it reach the limits of the dictionary they start
with, then they will move on to a larger dictionary with a larger vocabulary.
	Once our brain surgeon is happy with the normal vocabulary of this larger
dictionary, he will want to discover the medical extension to the language
so that he can effectively attend the next world conference of brain
surgeons in Alma Ata.

the words in the dictionary, and, thus, will reject the language as being
too hard.  It might be a darn good IAL vocabulary, but learning of
language, like everything should be in gradual stages, and this suggests
the use of a restricted, but adequate, vocabulary, at the start.

lists to the majority of Glosa-pe.  If they had had the money to buy the

There's no way to point out the absurdity of a false claim without insulting
the person whose claim is being de-bunked.  The NGL folks say they want to
get "market share" for their new L1 language, and I simply pointed out that
there is no market clamoring for new L1 languages.

The NGL folks also claim that their language is nearly a loglan and "more
suited to the modern world than English," then one of them puts forward a
vocabulary list derived from Ogden's Basic English -- a list of some of
the most vague, polysemous words in English.  Whenever a bunch of 
anglophones design a new language for the world and then offer one-word
English glosses for their morphemes, it is a sign that little or no
attention has been paid to semantics.

The gap between the claims made by NGL fans and the reality is beginning
to rival that of Glosa.

    I will try to respond to a few points in some of Robin's posts here
rather than making scattered replies.

    I think this would be a very good idea for those who really want
the language to succeed.  But I really don't know what would happen if
they decline to accept it.  Like John Schilke, I think it would be a
bad thing if there were a split in what little Glosa movement there is.

    Yes.  Pidgins.  They are in daily use and have a restricted
vocabulary (although I have no information on the specific vocabulary
size of particular pidgins).  As I have mentioned before, I have read
that Tok Pisin, a pidgin, is in use in parliamentary debates in Papua
New Guinea.  Is a pidgin a "baby language"?  It would seem to me that
the idea of a "baby language" is more a put-down than an argument. 
Sorry, Robin.  Was Hogben's Interglossa a "baby language" with its
restricted vocabulary?  And I never estimated the base vocabulary size
of Pham Xuan Thai's FRATER, but he translated the entire United Nations
Charter into it, as well as portions of relgious scriptures from around
the world.

    I think it comes down to differing ideas about the purpose of an
auxiliary language.  I do not see any one single auxlang as the be-all
and end-all of the totality of human communication, just a help for
those of dissimilar tongues.  That is why I am not in favor of such a
large vocabulary.  There may be room for more than one auxiliary
language, one, say, for basic communication and one for international
subtlety.  (But again, see FRATER; I suppose I really should try to
estimate its vocabulary.)  I see something like Glosa in the first role
and something like Interlingua or even Esperanto, with their
multi-thousand-word vocabularies, in the second.  (But even such a
division of labor might or might not really be necessary.)

    There is also the issue of competition in the auxlang marketplace. 
An isolating language with a small vocabulary might have a distinct
advantage over something like Interlingua, with a vocabulary running
into the tens of thousands.  It would to me.

    But it has happened!  Alice Morris Vanderbilt poured money into
IALA, which produced Interlingua.  I doubt that foundations might put 
a lot of miney into Glosa -- although you never know -- but an
enthusiastic rich donor might.

    I don't think so.  It appears to me that we just have differing

    "Lost face"?  I have to say that that one escapes me.  Being poor
myself at the moment (I can barely afford to stay on the 'net) I can
sympathize with the authors' possibly impecunious situation.  That is
hard.  But life itself is hard at times.  That is the unpleasant
reality of things.  They gave me approval to put the Glosa Basic
Reference on the world wide web without any specification for payment
by shareware or any other method.  Their copyright is on it, but the
cat is more or less out of the bag.  If it were merely smoothed out and
enhanced along the lines I have suggested in the last few weeks, I
would be satisifed.

    Yes.  I was using more a bottom-up approach, and you (and Bill
Patterson, as nearly as I can tell) are top-downers.  If the intention
of our efforts is in fact to come up with a revised/enhanced base
vocabulary, we _may_ be able to come out more or less in the same place.

    No doubt, and he is to be commended for his labor.  I am not
discounting it, and I cannot claim that I would necessarily do a better
job.  That is precisely why I have taken the bottom-up approach. 
Unfortunately, it is results that count, now how much sweat by whom 
was put into the effort.  Will he (and Wendy Ashby) let no one else
participate in the effort?  I don't know.  However, they did accept my
efforts in producing the Basic Reference on the www, so I am presuming
that they might be somewhat open to others' efforts.

   Without knowing the attidude and stance of the authors, this remain
a considerable unknown.

    I think you are overlooking the pidgins again.  A lot of folklore
has been preserved and recorded in Tok Pisin, and I have heard that
there are even radio broadcasts in it out of Australia itself.  It may
be similar with Police Motu and other pidgins.

    And I would like to see if a well-chosed limited vocabulary _would_

    Which might well be my own case.  Over the years I have developed
reading and concentration impairments, which may have a lot to do with
why the idea of a limited vocabulary appeals to me, I admit.

    This has been, more or less, my position all along, and my hunch is
that the base might not have to be much larger than that in the current
Basic Reference.

    Yes, I think we do have a serious disagreement here.

Some search engines scour the web, sucking in every word on every page,
discarding only the common ones for the language of the page (according
to their estimation) such as "the" or "a" for English pages. These engines
*will* have your page, but they're so bloated with words that they return
many many useless hits with the few useful ones mixed in somewhere.

Some just examine the titles, so it's important to stuff the relevant words
in there too.

Some are more commercial and will guarantee that your site will be within
the first few hits - for a price. That could be argued either way, as a Bad
Thing or a Good Thing. But it could be useful.

Something I just started experimenting with is the HTML META tag. Some
engines index on this "keyword" information, so this could be an important
tool to use. For example, on my pages I've put something like this...

<HTML>
<HEAD>
  <TITLE>Ailanto: Glosa</TITLE>
  <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="glosa, language, auxiliary, international, auxlang">

I hadn't thought of this. Is this due to poverty or their sort of economy?
The thought saddens me, that such a thing could be an obstacle to an

If you can get that information we might be able to give them a hand.

Hey, I like UNIX! I use it every day at work. HPUX 10.2, and up until
a few months ago we were using elm for mail. Of course, we've also had
W95 & NT machines around too; and now we're using an NT server and
Outlook to handle mail, and a new ISP.

Anyway, there's lots of good freeware out there.
Maybe something just right for them!

    Of course, I was the one who forwarded the post (from a public
forum).  Unfortunately the poster did not elaborate on what he meant. 
I just thought I would send it along as at least _some_ mention of
Glosa.

Subject: My Approach to Glosa
To: glosalist
Date: Sat, 13 Jun 98 21:1

    From time to time I have been known to express myself poorly. 
Perhaps of late I have done something like that with respect to Glosa. 
Let me say here that I would like to see Glosa or something like it
succeed as an auxiliary language.  When I first encountered Glosa, I
was fairly enthusiastic about it, and I did put in many hours of labor
developing the Glosa Basic Reference on the www, corresponding with
Richmond to obtain their approval.  It was only later that my
enthusiasm cooled somewhat as I encountered some of what I consider
insufficiencies in the language and its presentation.  But I think
these insufficiencies are remediable without anything like major
revisions, and it is to those matters that I have tried to address 
myself.

    I would still like to see something like it succeed, even if I
never master it myself.  So the remarks I have made of late have been
intended as constructive criticism, even if at times I may have
expressed myself infelicitously.  I think that there is an honest and
mutually sincere difference of opinion on the vocabulary size issue. 
That may have to be dealt with.  But all the rest, even if I have not
presented myself well, has been with the intention of helping, not
complaining.

Coining "FA" from "Fe" and "An"	- 
  "Don id a fa."
  "Fa pa ki-in u kamera."
  "Qod es fa?"
	This may not work, but at least it is distinctively 1st-singular,
and not possibly something else, as well.

*	True, words in Glosa are NOT defined by their ending: IE Glosa words do
not, as do Esperanto words (and, as did Interglossa words), carry a
terminal vowel P-o-S marker.
	Is this distinction roughly similar to the ^rule of thumb^ division of the
Glosa lexicon into substantives and function words?

*	Here we probably suffer from not having read the same Linguistics text
book.  Please define your terms or give us a reference to the source that
will.
	While these postulates may all be self-evident to superior intellects,
some of us on the Glosalist are just your average World Language Reformers,
and not necessarily of the razor-sharp brain.  Comma?
(Whole)?  (Context)?  It's all a bit 'complex' at present.

*	I had thought of VIDE being a lexeme '=the notion of seeing', but then I
imagined the GE- particle to have a lexical value of its own, as well.
While most Glosa-pe would be more in tune with Subject and Object, rather
than (agent) and (patient), these more traditional terms, though less
flexible, would probably be adequate for most learners. 
	Somehow, I feel your second proposition (Subjective Voice) is not correct
for Glosa.  Though abstractions are theoretically satisfying, I would
appreciate some more concrete representations to help me understand what
you are saying.
   Without an example of what you mean, the  ''(patient)ge-vide(whole)''
statement is fairly meaningless to me.  Might a possible example be:
   Eng. "He is seen by the world."
   Gls. "An es ge-vide ex u munda."#
  ..... "An gene ge-vide ex u munda."%
  ..... "An ge-vide ex munda." * 
 #: O.K. but imports the English-like usage of the BEING concept.
 %: Old Glosa, but my preference owing to presence of "gene" as PV marker.
 *: Feels wrong to me; seems over abbreviated; lacks a full 'verb'.

	AND, before commenting on the examples given below, I would say that such
theoreticisation may not be helping the general move towards the
dissemination of Glosa.  My understanding of the best use of this List for
the development of the language is more in the use of dialogue.  You do
seem to be expostulating what you think Glosa is, or ought to be, rather
than than looking to see what it has become - over the past twenty years.
	There is certainly room for development ... and improvement ... in the
language, and this is necessary if the language to give the best showing
when, or if, an IAL competition is announced.  BUT, I am not convinced
that, at this moment, discussion at the top theoretical level is the best
use of the human resources available to this project.  

>Id vide = Id es vide 
>-> (context)It(whole) (agent)seeing()
>-> It sees (G'i vidas)
>
*	 These are not equivalent: syntax suggests "es" leads into a gerund =Eng.
"seeing".   A shaman who smokes the local weed, and perceives scenes by
looking at the inside wall of his tent, could tell you: it is seeing.]
	"It sees." is the right rendition; I'm not researching the Esperanto, but
assume that that language is your base reference for the ability of words
to convey meaning.

>Id ge-vide = Id es ge-vide
>-> (context)It(whole) (patient)seeing()
>-> It is seen (G'i vidig'as)
>
*	"Id ge-vide."* is not a full sentence: no full verb.  So =/=.
	You have interpreted the Gls. "ge-" to be equivalent to the
Esp. "-ig'-" as a Passive Voice marker: this is not so; Glosa's "ge-" makes
sense, syntactically, as a Participle Marker.

>Id gene ge-vide = Id es gene ge-vide
>-> (context)It(whole) gets (patient)seeing()
>-> Something starts to look at it, it acquires see-ed-ness (G'i ekvidig'as)
>
*	Again =/=.  "es" and "gene" have a supplementary relationship: it is one
or the other, not both.
	Glosa tends to 'map onto' English quite well, but the reverse process does
not seem to work.  It looks as if you have thought:-
  ~It  is  getting  seen.~
 .. | . | ... | ..... |
 .. V . V ... V ..... V
  "Id  es   gene   ge-vide."*

BUT this process is invalid.  English does not map onto Glosa, as it
appears you have attempted to do.
	Though it is not my desire to do so, I will consult the _Esperanto- 
English Dictionary_ by Butler, because I respect your use of that language
as a semantic baseline.  So, using the analytic mode, which is not my wont,
I get:
  G'i  ...... It
  ek-  ...... begins to
  vid- ...... to see | seeing  .... [I prefer the Infinitive to the Gerund]
  -ig'- ..... becomes | be | get(ting) <Intransitive, Passive>
  -as  ...... now <Present Tense>
I render this as  &It is beginning to be seen.& ____(1)
 ................ &It is now getting seen.& ________(2)
 ................ &It starts to be seen.& __________(3)
 ................ &It now becomes seen.& ___________(4)
 ................ &It is beginning to become seen.& (5)
 ................ &It is beginning to get seen.& ___(6)
	These are all acceptible English-language sentences, but are they all
legitimate representations of your Esperanto sentence, or of the Glosa
sentence with which we started?
Giving the same treatment to the Glosa version,
 "Id gene ge-vide." 
I get:
  Id  ...... It
  gene ..... gets <Passive Voice marker, when followed by "ge-">
  ge-  ..... (got) <="-ed" or "-en" as Participle Particle>
  vide. .... (to see) | seen <=Participle when Infinitive preceded by "ge-"

>Vide id
>-> (context eg: they default:something)Seeing(patient) (whole)it()
>-> Something is looking at it / It is seen  (Vidig'as g'i)
>
*	"Vide id." is simply the Imperative: the Subject "Vi", or "Tu", is 
implied.  It seems quite reasonable for a syntax-based language, like Glosa
to use the Infinitive form to make the Imperative.
The Esperanto (baseline) sentence says much the same, but with possibly
un-necessary inflection:-
  Vid  ... to see | see | seeing <Imperative, not necess. shown by syntax>
  -ig'- .. becomes | be | get(ting) <Intransitive, Passive>
  -as  ... now <Present Tense marker> 
  g'i  ... it

AND for comparison:-
  Vide ... to see | see | seeing <Imperative implied by syntax>
  id  .... it

>"Id habe ge-vide" would, I suppose, mean "It has something that is seen"
>
*	When considering such sentences - in the abstract - I do try very hard to
picture a realworld situation in which the utterance might be made.
	"I picture myself at Lightning Ridge, opal mining (though I've never been
there), and I see a possum scampering off into the bush.  Looking at its
paws, I catch the glint of light on the prize opal, that I have just dug
out, and give chase.  It has something that I have seen!"
	Though I wouldn't feel comfortable with the construction you have given -
probably because "habe" demands an Object - I might, in the heat of the
moment, come out with:-
  "Id habe u ge-vide ra." [It has the/a seen thing.]  But I try to avoid
such ^pretzelised^ constructions.
	HABE in Glosa conveys TO HAVE and TO HAVE THE PROPERTY OF.  There are
usages like this in French .. l'eau avait chaud.(possibly)

*	Does NGL stand for New Generation Language?  I take it that "loglan" is
used here generically, to mean "logical language."  I see the parallel here
with Glosa, however, the Glosa authors started with Roget rather than
Ogden, so the foundation is well-laid.

*	It is quite clear that Glosa uses a "word translation dictionary" rather
than a dictionary with definitions.  Glosa would still have been on the
drawing board had the authors decided to go in for a full-scale dictionary;
so, I, for one, am thankful that they took the pragmatic view, and cut a
number of corners.
	But it is also very clear that semantics is the submerged, larger portion
of the language ^iceberg^.  The authors took a direct approach to the
situation and dealt with the visible element of syntax, claiming that the
sense of language learner/user would allow them to sort out the meanings.
	As I now understand it, the syntactical analysis is the first, but
superficial, stage of linguistic analysis, while a second, more searching,
semantic analysis follows this.  However, because the understanding of
meaning is much more testing of our linguistic systems, most Linguists and
Communicators concentrate on the visible, rule-governed element of
grammatical form.  Have the "rules of semantics" been published, yet?


>The gap between the claims made by NGL fans and the reality is beginning
>to rival that of Glosa.
>
*	I take it that this rather smart comment is from the David Armstrong
whose name appears at the head of the post.  He obviously thinks that
Glosa's claims and its realisation are widely separated: he is probably
still recovering from reading that Glosa has no grammar, and thus the
language can be learnt without the need for a grammar book.
	Such people, as Armstrong, may be time-wasters, but I will agree that our
promotional statements could be understated rather than overdone.  Perhaps
the authors should change their advertising agency to one with better
copy-writers.
	I find it quite interesting that there is such a range of theories extant
to describe language: if Linguistics was as good as it thinks it is, I
would have more respect for the comments of its practitioners.  But I can
see that the secrets of language are still locked in a 'black box' called
the brain, and I feel that the contents of this box are just as likely to
be intuited by the likes of Clark and Ashby, as by a Chomsky.

*	Do you see elision at work here?-  EG
An pa vesti-se in u ge-texo tegu. An pa vesti-se in u tegu; qi es ge-texo.
 .................. |______| .............................. |____________| 

U ge-texo tegu pa es ge-vesti ex an.  <Passive Voice>

 ......^^.................^........

In u texo vesti; qi an pa tekto, un andra pa ki in u kamera. <Active Voice>
in a woven garment that he made  the man  entered  the room
      
COMMENTS: I would say that using "texo" as an 'adjective' [=substantive
functioning as an adjective] is tricky: it could be translated into English
as either the participle "woven" or the gerund "weaving"; using *rough
Glosa* we just throw it in, and #may the receiver beware#; but, if we are
being considerate of our listener (or just accurate) we use **precise
Glosa** and spell out the participle using the appropriate affix, "ge-".
  So, maybe already, there is *correct* (pedantic OR accurate) Glosa, and a 
*vernacular* (back-fence OR rough) usage of it.  Perhaps "gene" is a case
in point: I see it simply as a 'Passive Voice marker'; and, while others
might see the inclusion of "gene" as unnecessary or wrong, I prefer to
think of it as the correct form, thus peceiving its absence as yet another
case of elision.

GAMMA TESTING: This is a concept I find handy.  In the same way that Bill
Gates alpha and beta tests his software, then releases it - still
containing bugs - on an unsuspecting public, Glosa is now past the alpha
and beta testing stage, but may still contain *bugs*.  Windows 95, in its
third version is apparently bug-free after very extensive 'Gamma Testing'
of versions one and two on the buying public; Glosa is now in its Gamma
Testing stage, where it seems user ready, and does work quite well, but
might be tweaked into better shape.  
  Under experimental conditions, I prefer to use the 'as is' 1992 Version
of Glosa, although some of the 'bugs' (alternative spellings, different
terminal vowels, synonyms, etc) are known to us, here, and have been
discussed.  The "experimental conditions" I talk about is the use of Glosa
in the Third World: the Tri Munda 'experimental subjects' are NOT
discussing the linguistics of Glosa, they ARE using it as a language.  
  For reasons which make good sense to me, I am trying not to confuse the
two strands of Glosa R&D: while the Glosalist/Conlang strand of Glosa
discussion takes a 'disinterested' scholarly direction, the 'Field
Application' adopts a 'committed' practical one.  I hope that these two
strands of R&D can complement one another, even though they might appear,
at present, to be going in opposite directions.  
  Glosa is being Gamma Tested in Uganda; and, after the 'back-room boys'
tinker with it a bit, 'cleaned up versions' of the dictionaries are likely
to be sent to them as *upgrades* ... without any serious discussion being
necessary about any (minor) changes in the lists, when compared with
earlier ones.
  Tweakings to Glosa's grammar (syntax) might be another matter.  I will
soon start sending more guides on this to Uganda, but will discuss their
content with Glosalist subscribers and the authors before sending
pidgeon-post paper versions of these to Uganda.

*	Using basic P-o-S underlining, this Passive Voice form is:-
  Id   es  ge-vide  ex  andra.
 Pron - V - Part - Prep - N

	The forward-direction Active Voice version, in simple form, is:-
  Andra vide id.
   N -  V - Pron

 . In AV there is no 'form verb' just the substantive 'verb'.
 . I prefer "gene" as the 'form verb' in PV, because the %gets% concept
seems more apt than the %equivalence% concept that is (OR should be)
conveyed by "es".
 . "andra" is a 'noun' (= substantive functioning as a noun), and that is
what the syntax would lead us to expect, so the "un" would seem unwanted or 
elided.
 . What if the substantive after the preposition functioned as some other
part of speech? EG
  "Id es ge-vide ex kogita; ... "  <"ge-vide" used metaphorically>
   it is  seen  from thinking  
 
The "u", if included, 'flags' the coming of a simple Noun, of the Indirect
Object variety, and I personally feel happier with this style of
communication.  In the second example, "kogita" can be seen to function as
a noun, but the syntax (and semantics) tell us it is functioning as a
gerund, and that it ought to be followed by a Noun Clause.

*	It looks as if I have been using Old Glosa, again - with the 
"gene ge-X" structure: that was the way I learnt it; must get Richmond
feedback on the present usage for full Passive Voice.  I still like the
O.G. form.

>
*	I look at the Glosa lexicon from the concept point of view, and see that
there is a valuable conceptual difference between these two Glosa words;
so, when 'thinking in Glosa' I consider the abstractions conveyed by the
words, and try to use them accordingly.
  IE  esce - become, through growth
      gene - gets; gets to be

  EG  "U ju-bovi esce u fo mega an-bovi."
     ~The calf became (grew to be) a very large bull.~

      "An pato gene ma mali."
     ~His illness becomes (gets/got) worse.~

>    One might say that if the window is broken, it acquires brokenness.
>However, there is a subtle nuance of meaning here in English.  If the
>window is broken, it is patient.  If it acquires brokenness, it is
>agent.
*	So, in Glosa, by choosing the right 'form verb' "gene" or "es" we change
the flavour of the sentence, ... and thus of the way the 'participle'
relates to the subject of the Passive Voice sentence.

>    The two situations are not precisely equivalent.  Nevertheless,
>in most circustances I would say that most users of English employ a

>
>        Id es ge-frakti.
>          subject is patient
>        Id gene ge-frakti.
>          subject is agent
>
*	Seems normal: the subject is the main participant in our sentence, and
comes first; but if the subject has the action done to it, we naturally
choose the PV form.

>However, the authors have indicated the latter to be simply:
>
>        Id pa gene frakti.  (Depending on the nuance, 'pa' might be

>
>"It gets break." will do for subject-as-agent and "It is broken." for
>subject-as-patient.  In this case, I supprt the A&C usage.
>
*	Now that you have spelled it out in full, I agree with what you have
said, BUT, and there is a big "but", this level of sophistication in
language use is just too much for learners, who are new to the language!!!
	For the sake of getting Glosa up and running, at a high level of fluency,
the fewer the rules, and the less nuances the better.  As long as the
language is not set into an inflexible structure, then these 'extensions'
of usage can be added later.
	For all of the reasons set out above, I favour the teaching of a
simplified, standardised form for the creation of the Passive Voice, which
was totally absent from Old Glosa - and, I suspect, from Hogben's Interglossa.

>
*	. English usages should not be incorporated uncritically.
	. These would impose an additional burdon on the non-English-speaking
learner of Glosa, agreed.
	. But where usages in English emerged as a result of the evolution of a
'natural' use of language, then there is every chance that comparable
usages will be equally 'natural' (IE psycholinguistically correct) in Glosa.

Subject: 2K Compromise

Date: Sat, 20 Jun 98 23:4

Glosalist Frinds and Glosa Authors,
   This is a brief statement of our differences over scope of the language
and optimum size(s) of dictionaries.
   Possibly the best situation for the world would be to have a number of
auxiliary language for different purpose, say Glosa for tourism, Esperanto
for diplomacy, and Interlingua for commerce; this would be similar to the
present situation with English&French for telephone exchanges, English for
air traffic, Aymara for the Andes, and Swahili for E.Afrca, etc.
   Glosa could be a trading/emergency language with the scope of a pidgin,
like Tok Pisin; or it could aspire to being a full language with universal
scope.
   Up to now, I have been working on the latter assumption:-
	1. I have the feeling that political leaders will want to have to make
only one decision, and will see dupication as an unnecessary and avoidable
expense.
	2. I have assumed, all along that Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby have projected
the Glosa concept into research and diplomacy, as well as offering a
langugewishing to provide people with a languag for daily living.
	3. If there were different auxiliaries for different areas of endeavour,
there would be junction areas that needed to communicate within communities
served by two or more auxiliaries.
	4. While Glosa is being disseminated a limited vocabulary is all that can
effectivly be supported by the G.E.O., and so the authors are concentrating
on the Glosa 1000 groups, even though they use the Glosa 6000 range in the
periodical, _Plu Glosa Nota_.
	5. While I look at sophisticated discussions in English, and wonder how
the ideas and nuances will be conveyed in an uninflected Glosa, I work on
the principle that the language is capable of extension through creation of
compounds, and through development of a more sophisticated affix system
than, at present, with the two letter categories.

	On the question of the optimal size of a Glosa dictionary for general
circulation, a happy compromise can be reached, I am sure:-
	a. While Paul Bartlett and Bill Patterson feel that a 2000 word dictionary
should be adequate for the present, I have argued for a speedy upgrade to
the fuller 6000 word dictionary.
	b. In the present situation, it would seem that a compromise at the 2K
mark would probably serve Glosa well for the next five, or possibly ten,
years.  Whole communities of Glosa-pe could gain fluency in the language
and comprise an effective global community - operating within the limits of
approximately two thousand words.
	c. use of a 2K dictionary would provide considerable economies in postage
and the learning load for those starting with the language.
	d. With the desire for more communication power, some Glosa-pe would feel
the need for a larger dictionary, such as the 6K edition; but, general
Glosa publications could be largely restricted to the widely distributed
vocabulary, giving meanings for words, beyond the 2K range, when they are
required for specific published articles.
	e. It is imaginable that a research publication, using a fuller lexicon,
could be circulated among those wishing to explore the direction
of future development of the language.  Such a publication could be the
site of publishing of scholarly works on the way Glosa might become
generalised and universalised, after an anticipated adoption as the IAL.

	On the question of dissemination of Glosa learning materials in electronic
format, I have raised the concept of Shareware:-
	i. Although software piracy exists, the release of Glosa dictionaries,
learning materials and publications as "Shareware" estblishes the copyright
owners' legitemate claim to the intellectual property and to the right to
profit from its distribution as Shareware.
	ii. Any distribution of Glosa materials through the Internet, as
Shareware, protects the G.E.O.'s ownership rights, while both fostering
increased future sales of paper-based publications, and bringing in a level
of revenue from Registrations.
	iii. In traditional marketing terminology a Shareware release is a "loss
leader", which involves the calculated risk that those sampling the
products will be attracted to make more substantial purchased,
subsequently.  In Shareware, ways can be arranged to prode sufficient to
whet the appetite for more.  
	iv. While the Glosa organisation desires both sales of materials and
dissemination of the Glosa ethos, Shareware offers an increase of both,
albeit with a time-lag between the distribution of the copyright materials
and the receipt of revenue.  However, taking the broader distribution
networks available to Shareware, such a situaion should soon provide a net
financial gain.
	v. Releasing Glosa learning materials as Shareware is good Poblic
Relations, because it offers people the opportunity to investigate the
language on a "try before you buy" basis.  This gives many people the
opportunity to learn about Glosa, and to try the language before they
become finacially committed; also, it gives the marginal enquirer, who will
subsequently become a Glosa speaker, the chance of discovering the language
effortlessly, without the feeling that he is risking anything or declaring
a commitment.
	vi. Seldom is a complete work released through Shareware channels: enough
materials for fluency in Glosa could be issued on disk and through the Net,
such that interested people would want a hardcopy dictionary and graded
lessons, which could be included in the Cost of Registration.

The 'bottom line' is people, not money.  R.G.

    A reasonable statement of them (which I will not take up space by
repeating).

    There are, in fact, those who propose precisely this: more than one
auxiliary for more than one purpose.  I myself have mixed feelings about
this approach.

    At the risk of sounding tiresomely repetitious, there simply is
no one "Glosa 1000" but rather multiple "Glosa 1000s."  It is this
inconsistency that dampened my initial enthusiasm and has disinclined
me to put a great deal more effort into it.  I would rather learn one
Glosa, not multiple Glosas.

:         5. While I look at sophisticated discussions in English, and wonder how

: the principle that the language is capable of extension through creation of

    I have thought that the 17 (not 18!) current affixes might have been
extended originally, and some time ago on the Glosalist I proposed a few
more affixes.  However, I am not now suggesting adding too much to the
basic structure of the language.  My main "hobby horse," if you will, is
a consistent vocabulary (three issues here) and presentation (mainly in
the form of extending the "Mechanics of Glosa" approach).

:         On the question of the optimal size of a Glosa dictionary for general

:         a. While Paul Bartlett and Bill Patterson feel that a 2000 word dictionary
: should be adequate for the present, I have argued for a speedy upgrade to
: the fuller 6000 word dictionary.

    I think that this is a genuine and real difference of opinion among
the participants on Glosalist.  Considering the current size of the
Glosa Basic Reference on the world wide web, which was largely created
from collating different alleged "Glosa 1000s", my estimate of an
updated word list has been in the 1500 - 2000 range.  Robin and I
obviously differ here (Bill has to speak for himself), as I consider a
relatively small vocabulary to be one of the great strengths of an
auxiliary language like Glosa.

:         c. use of a 2K dictionary would provide considerable economies in postage
: and the learning load for those starting with the language.

    In practical terms, this is true, although it is not my primary
point.  However, a smaller dictionary could be much more efficiently
turned into other national languages, which is almost a necessity if
Glosa is to prosper.

:         On the question of dissemination of Glosa learning materials in electronic
: format, I have raised the concept of Shareware:-

    I cannot speak knowledgeably about other countries, but to the best
of my information, shareware is legally enforceable in theory in the
United States and Canada.  However, in practice the monetary amounts are
so small that the economics of enforcement for infringement are not
really worth it.  Shareware is truly an honor system.

:         i. Although software piracy exists, the release of Glosa dictionaries,
: learning materials and publications as "Shareware" estblishes the copyright
: owners' legitemate claim to the intellectual property and to the right to
: profit from its distribution as Shareware.

    Copyright is already claimed for the materials on the world wide
web.  I was very careful about putting a copyright notice on them
(although the "registered charity" business is meaningless in the US
so far as I know).

:         ii. Any distribution of Glosa materials through the Internet, as
: Shareware, protects the G.E.O.'s ownership rights, while both fostering
: increased future sales of paper-based publications, and bringing in a level
: of revenue from Registrations.

    The whole matter of copyright and intellectual property before the
law on the internet is a real can of worms.  There is a lot of
wrangling and disputation going on in the US, and undoubtedly elsewhere,
even as we speak.  Before it is all over, I suspect that the courts in
many countries are going to have a field day.  However, is the desire to
spread the use of Glosa as a meaningful auxiliary language, or is the
desire to get rich off of it?

    A possible problem is the material already on the world wide web.
It is copyrighted in the name of the Glosa Education Organization, so no
one can profit from it (legally and morally).  However, nothing has been
said about paying for it, and it might be rather difficult to try to
claim payment retroactively.  If the vocabulary and presentation issues
can be smoothed out, I think that the world wide web is one of the best
means available for furthering the spread of Glosa, although to be sure
there are many who do not have access to it.  (What is really needed,
once a uniform version is available, is material in multiple languages.
Proponents of other auxiliaries are burning up their keyboards getting
material on their favorite auxlangs into place.  The other night I even
saw something in Albanian!)

:         iii. In traditional marketing terminology a Shareware release is a "loss
: leader", which involves the calculated risk that those sampling the
: products will be attracted to make more substantial purchased,
: subsequently.  In Shareware, ways can be arranged to prode sufficient to
: whet the appetite for more.

    With computer software, this may be true at times, inasmuch as the
non-registered, publicly-available version is sometimes what is known as
"crippleware."  Nevertheless, a lot of shareware is the real thing and
the author has no more to offer.  It is just an honor system that people
will pay up.

Dear Friends, plu Glosa-pe,

	As I was looking for another book this morning, I came across my 
rather sadly deteriorating copy of L. Hogben's _Interglossa_.  It is the 
1943 Pelican (Penguin) paperback, of some 285 pages.  It really is a fine 
job of printing, considering the wartime restrictions which myust have 
applied, but the paper is acid-treated and is showing more signs of age 
than I do!
	My question is this:  I wish to keep it and to keep it legible.  
I plan to ask around a bit about restoration, but I have few contacts and 
fewer hopes that anything can be done.  Mere photocopying (however 
expensive that would be) would miss the nicely colored (mainly red) 
segments of the printed pages and thus not really be a satisfactory 
solution.  I have no way to get it scanned for the internet, but I do 
think that it is a valuable historical (and linguistic) document, and 
should be preserved.
	Does anyone have any ideas?  I'd be willing to lend it for any 
reasonable length of time for "processing," but want the effort to be 
worthwhile and (one would hope) not terribly expensive.
	I'm eager to hear from you.  I've no idea how many copies exist, 
but this is the only one I have ever seen.  My copy bears a Dec. '43 date 
of the original owner, and I bought it about 1973 in a used book shop.

not impede it with such a conglomeration as "get"?  I can easily suppose
that in many native languages, there simply is no single verb
corresponding to this hydra-headed monster of "get."  I think this "get"
in Glosa should be junked forthwith.

:  . What if the substantive after the preposition functioned as some other
: part of speech? EG

    What does this mean?  In every grammar that I have ever heard of, a
_substantive_ follows a preposition and is a substantive, not some other
part of speech.

:
: The "u", if included, 'flags' the coming of a simple Noun, of the Indirect

: communication.

    Based on a direct communication I had from Richmond, you seem to
differ from them in usage here.  Although 'u' before a noun following a
preposition is allowable, I see not a particle's worth of difference in
the meaning whether the marker is there or not.

:                 In the second example, "kogita" can be seen to function as
: a noun, but the syntax (and semantics) tell us it is functioning as a
: gerund, and that it ought to be followed by a Noun Clause.

    By definition, a gerund is a substantive, albeit one derived from
a verb.  Some languages, such as IALA Interlingua, have no gerund
construction as such.  And why must a gerund be followed by a noun
clause?  It certainly does not have to in English.

    I have never understood just what a "concept language" is.  How does
such a thing, if it even exists, differ from any other language.  So
what is the "concept point of view"?

:       gene - gets; gets to be

    I do not understand any practical difference.

    I do not have a copy of "Interlgossa" at hand, so I cannot say about
that.  However, I wonder what "Old Glosa" has to do with the price of
eggs now.  It seems to have been a provisional form which is no longer
"in effect" and therefore no longer particularly relevant.

    Exactly my point.  If someone has to learn or know English first in
order to use Glosa properly, then Glosa becomes entirely superfluous.
Just junk it and use English as the auxiliary language.  If Glosa cannot
stand on its own two feet, then it is worthless and a waste of time.

:         . But where usages in English emerged as a result of the evolution of a
: 'natural' use of language, then there is every chance that comparable
: usages will be equally 'natural' (IE psycholinguistically correct) in Glosa.

    "Evolution of 'natural' use of language" does not exist, in my
opinion.  Why are not usages in other languages equally "natural"?
Please consider the post I made on AUXLANG recently of an excerpt from
a work of fiction which addresses this very issue.  Is there a bit of
language chauvinism here?  My native tongue is "natual" and others are
"unnatural"?  Total rubbish.

    There are high-grade color photocopiers these days.  Just ask the
Secret Service trying to foil counterfeiters.  I used one once at a
copy shop in Salem (not far from where John lives).  The per-copy price
was higher, but the quality -- for a photograph, no less -- was not too

    There is a copy, also deteriorating, in the Library of Congress in

    Powell's, maybe?  (I think they were already in business then.)

	I'll look into this, although I fear the 140+ copies (since the 
book would allow copying of 2 pages at once) might be staggering.

	Almost for sure!  I've frequented that haunt for many years, and 
have a vague recollection of finding it there -- much to my surprise.

	Again, thanks for the helpful ideas.

    You might contact a state library which has an Archive Section: such a
place should give you the best advice.  I too, have a copy in similar
condition to yours: I could contact the NSW public Library, which is active
in the preservation, through computer photographic scanning, of Australian
historical documents.

   Normal scanning with OCR is unsuitable for heavily formatted texts: the
photographic record is the only way to go.

*   I would rather, personally, stay with the "clumsy" construction, but
will see how it gets elided by other Glosa-pe.  As well as believing the
two parts to be functional, I will admit to a rare sentimentalisation, and
say that the 'gene ge-X' construction is ''quaint''.  It very clearly marks
the differentness of the Passive Voice form.

*   I refer specifically to the "Glosa 6000" dictionary, and I believe
there is only one edition of it: the 1992 First Printing.
    At an early stage, I decided that I would either have to completely
recast this dictionary, or use it, as well as I could, inconsistencies and
all.
    Using it 'as is' was both a calculated risk and an economic decision on
my part.  Had the drafts been properly edited and all inconsistencies
removed, prior to publishing, things would have been easier between us: as
it is, I am extending my suspension of judgment to the authors; and you are
pointing out that an invention must be well-crafted and polished, before
the man and woman in the street will bother to pick it up and look at it.
    I wished to avoid further negative reactions to the 'annoying typos' in
the dictionaries, so decided that it was time to rationalise the word-list
and SORT it using electronic means.  Thus, I had the "Glosa 6000" list
scanned, and that is where we are to-day: trying to rationalise the list to
something with fully consistent spelling, comprising a full working
dictionary - without marginal words.

*   I use "substantives" to cover all of the words that represent realworld
things, actions, or descriptions: Linguists have a term for this group,
which is infinite in size .. by contrast with this, there are the "function
words", that comprise a small, finite group of words that allow us to show
the relationships between the things, actions, and descriptions we are
talking about.
    In Glosa, where the lexical item can function as verb, noun, or
modifier, I find it convenient to label such a meaningful, multipurpose
concept/word as a "substantive."
    There are some words that are used in all languages simply to
facilitate the flow of ideas, and to define relationships beteen the more
^meaty^ words. 
Together with the 'function words' there are some 'verbs' that are present
for the demands of syntax more than to convey concepts: these 'verbs' are
often present to preserve the S-V-O form of the sentence, hence my term
"form verbs."  In English, words that can be used in this way are: is, do,
have, get, go. EG  I HAVE to have it.  He IS wet.  They DO want it.  I'll
GET GOing in a minute.  She was GOing to go.

But what makes English difficult .. and Glosa reasonably exact .. is that
'verbs', which are used as 'form verbs', also have a literal meaning as
well, and can, and should, be used SUBSTANTIALLY when this literal meaning
is called for.

substantially .. or, alternatively, on odd occasions, in one of its very
few, well-defined 'form verb' roles.

*   In these demo sentences dissociated from normal life, I still try to
imagine realworld situations in which they might be used.  So here I will
try to use the same 'clause' as a whole sentence, and as a subsidiary
clause in a larger sentence:-
 
  "Id gene ge-vide ex u diskursi."  - "It is seen from the discussion." .. (A)

  "Id gene ge-vide ex diskursi; plu faktu habe ero."  .................... (B)
  "It is seen from discussion, that the facts are wrong."

    In (A), the substantive after the preposition is a 'noun'.  In (B), the
same substantive is neither a 'verb' nor a 'noun', but has more of the
qualities of a gerund, and the "u" marker is not needed - though, if
present, would not necessarily be wrong.

*   In (A) and (B) above, I argue for the significance of "u" in
distinguishing between 'noun' and 'gerund'.  I suspect that there would be
something on it in the Functional Grammar method of analysing sentences.  Re
Richmond, I guess that the authors are promoting the elided, "telegraphic"
method of using the language.

auxlangs, and become fluent in them.  But since I am trying to do things in
my present lifetime, other than Language Reform, I have only budgetted time
to do R&D on, and learn, one auxlang.
    In the case of "kogita", above, I thought that the semantics called for
a *thing*.  Originally, a noun clause in Glosa could have the forms of
"xxx; X."
or "xxx; ke X."  (xxx -last word of preceding phrase; X - Noun Clause; "ke" -
=Eng. "that")  But, since then, the authors have decided to elide the "ke"
into oblivion: I may not agree that this is best Linguistically, but will
go along with it to support the ^party vote^.

*   The difference is a supposed difference between using language elements
as concrete objects, and using them as abstract ideas.  The difference
could be that between prose and poetry.  I fear that Glosa's rating as a
language in which the words represent abstract ideas (concepts) is one of
the reasons for its small currency.  Most languages do call a spade a
"spade", and one instantly has a mental picture of an object with which one
digs the soil. 
This is the opposite of the 'concept language' situation, in which "spade"
represents ~spadeness~, and the word, "spade" is interpreted from all its
possible realisations by reference to the surrounding words, IE its syntax.
    In the sentence, "He told me to spade the manure into the ground." we
see "spade" realised as a verb: we get a mental picture of the process of
turning a brown substance into the soil; we do not necessarily see - in our
mind's eye - a wooden and metal digging implement.  This is definitely a
case of using English as a 'concept language.'  BUT, most of the time that
people use English, they are using it as a 'concrete language.'  Glosa was
designed to be usable at the *abstract* level all the time: and this may be
a feat beyond the powers of most people.
    Of course, I believe that the move from concrete language (and concrete
thinking) to abstract language (and abstract thinking) is simply a case of
an improvement in civilisation ... and Glosa is riding on the crest of the
wave of this civilisation advance.

*   What I should have said was that the authors originally said that Glosa
did not have a Passive Voice.  Then, somewhere between '84 and '92, they
decided that we would have to allow people the option of using a Passive
Voice form, if they really thought it was needed.  
INTERGLOSSA p180 features "(472) _ge_  that has got; that has been"
   EG  Hypo ge astra syn phylla urani
       Beneath a starred and leafy sky

  p181 has (473) "_gene_ get; acquire; receive; receipt or acquisition (in
the abstract)"
   "Gene is equivlent to become only when associated with an abstraction.
When become expresses incipient identification, we use the couplet proto
eque (469)."  and
   "Gene couplets convey the passive meaning of corresponding constructions
with acte, dicte and stimule.  When the amplifier is a physical state, we
can then express the passive by means of a habe couple; but it is better to
use the gene construction when an explicit agent follows, e.g.:
   U porta pre habe claustro   = The door was shut; The door has closed

   U porta pre gene claustro ex fe. = The door was shut by her.

There is a list of gene couplets on pp. 196-206 at the end of this chapter."
*   So, "ge" and "gene" are directly from Interglossa, but the Glosa
authors did not want to introduce Hogben's passive form into the revised
language; however, requests for a passive, caused them to look again at
Hogben's book.  Hogben went into considerable lengths to create phrasal
usages under the heading of "Semantics."  The Glosa authors have tried to
avoid printing a grammar book with the same *prescriptive* style that
Hogben used in _Interglossa_.
    Maybe, it is time to do something to redress this omission.  Perhaps,
through agreement with the authors, this group can knock into shape a brief
guide to the syntax of Glosa.

*   Well, I have had conclusive proof that this is NOT the case: LUI Hatao
from China wrote atrocious English, but perfect Glosa.
    But the absence of inputs from Glosa-pe living in non-English speaking
cultures is a serious deficiency of this List. 
    When we can locate Internet-connected, other-culture Glosa-pe, we will
necessarily have to use Glosa as the common language of this List ... or
possibly type everything in both our native tongues and Glosa.  The former
would be less time-consuming.

*   So all natlangs have over-riding cultural ingredients that adulterate
them in some way.  Glosa will, as you intimate all languages do, contain
some cultural adulterations that separate it from the hypothetical,
unobtainable 'natural' (psychologically pure) language.  How, I wonder,
would we recognise it, if we stumbled over a language whose grammar was
virtually ""culture-free""?

This, in my opinion, is Politically Correct rubbish.  However, henceforth
on this List, it is probably best for us (especially me) not to use the
word "natural", because a "natural language" cannot be defined.
    By your interpretation of the word, "natural", either we ought to avoid
using the word, or all languages are equally natural.  Either way, the
concept can have no discriminating power in our discussions, and so, is
rendered meaningless.
    Your AUXLANG story about the person who thought his language was the
only true way of thinking is clearly in mind.  It is probably a truism to
say that each person believes that thinking in his L1 is the only true and
correct way of thinking: it is simply a corollary of the Sapir-Wharf
Hypothesis.

conlang, might possibly be more evolved than another natlang, or conlang,
but I will continue to think that through linguistic change, languages can
shed some of their earlier cultural encrustments, and so, move closer to
more neutral situations, communication-wise.
    Matters of "naturalness", linguistic evolution, and the thorny Lanuage-of-
Thought, might, however, be brought up - in private communications -

Karo Glosalista:

I am new to the list and I am not a linguist, but I have been enjoying
getting into Glosa and reading the Glosalist postings and e-mails to me.
But I have some questions and a couple of suggestions.

1) The other evening I passed by a bakery. The wind was blowing towards me and 
the bread smelled wonderful. Now, how to express this in Glosa?

Last night I passed by a bakery.
Pa-di noktu (Is there a word/phrase for "last night"?)
mi pa ki proxi ("I went near" = "passed by"?)

u pani popina (What is a "cook-shop"? It's in the EGB.)

The wind was blowing towards me and the bread smelled wonderful.
Pneumo pa du fla ad mi e pani pa se olface miranda.

2) I noticed in William Patterson's list of missing Glosa words, the word
"neighbor".  A kludge for this appears in a list of Glosa examples:
para-fe but neither I nor William feel this to be the best possibility.
William has listed a few words for neighborhood in Glosa: vicina and parokia.
Vicina-pe, or vicina-an, or vicina-fe would seem to work well for neighbor.
Parokia-pe doesn't roll off the tongue easily. What do other members of the
list
think?

3) Another word that is missing is "boring". Not that Glosa is boring! In fact
I've
picked up Glosa to help me get through some absolutely-brain numbing meetings.
Is
"tedio" the closest Glosa equivalent?

4) Pra = "had" but is there a past tense equivalent for "has"? 

5) Can time words go anywhere in a Glosa sentence, as they can in English?
*Now* I want to eat. I *now* want to eat. I want *now* to eat. I want to eat
*now*.

6) Am I right in thinking there is little distinction between adjectives and
adverbs
in Glosa? Position in the sentence determines the function?

7) Finally, I have to come down in favor of using the verb gene or es with the
prefix
ge-. I do not feel ge- by itself is enough. It seems to me that ge- indicates a 
state of being. The object has been put into the state of whatever - being
broken,
being seen, being cooked, whatever. The object *is* (es), or *becomes* (gene)
the state.
Maybe even *is made* the state - se face. Pa and fu change the time but not the
state of being.

Saluta,
  Debs

    If you say 'pa-di', then it is not necessary to say 'pa ki',
because 'pa-di' already puts the time reference in the past.  I keep
harping on this in the list because if native-English Glosa-pe get into
this habit of over-marking everything under the sun, they may run into
trouble understanding Glosa-pe of other native languages which do not
do this over-marking, so that the other Glosa-pe do not do it in Glosa. 
(Actually, I would think that 'pa-noktu' would suffice in place of
'pa-di noktu'.)

     I would make "cook-shop" as 'kuko-do' and "bakery" as
'pani-kuko-do'.

> 2) I noticed in William Patterson's list of missing Glosa words, the word

    I think that 'para-pe' would serve well for "neighbor."  So do the
Glosa authors.

> 3) Another word that is missing is "boring".

    Perhaps something could be worked up from the verb 'fatiga'
("tire").

> 4) Pra = "had" but is there a past tense equivalent for "has"? 

    'Pra' seems to be an obsolete construction retained only by Robin
Gaskell, at least in my acquaintance.  Glosa's verb constructions do
not necessarily mimic those of English exactly, just as Esperanto has
no simple set of perfect tenses.  We need not -- indeed, should not --
think that the English way is the only way, and certainly not the only
correct way, of doing things.  In fact, compared to those of some
languages, English verb constructions are rather "muddy," mixing up
tense, mood, and aspect.  Many adult learners of English have a
difficult time with English verbs.  We should avoid introducing this
confusion into Glosa.

> 5) Can time words go anywhere in a Glosa sentence, as they can in English?

    So far as I know, yes, so long as the meaning is clear.

    That seems to be the case.  Both are modifiers of one usage or
another.

    I have already tendered my opinion on this in the past.

I tend to push this idea farther than the creators probably had in mind.
My wish is that any word can act as any part of speech (though some
combinations are less sensible than others!). But it does seem necessary
to have *something* mark the end of the subject and the beginning of the
verb.

I disagree. I think that this is one of those situations in which
agglutination fails, because the root-word combination just isn't
specific enough. Of course, in any language that builds words as
combinations of smaller roots, you'll run into what I like to call
the "purple-berry" problem....

(The "purple-berry" problem: I recall one language, or maybe just a
hypothetical example, which referred to some small fruit, *not* a
grape, as a "purple-berry"; a grape was a "wine-berry". Wine-berry
would be recognizable by a member of a culture that does wine, but
not by a person who doesn't know wine; either way, a purple-berry
could easily be taken for grape, or some other purple berry.)

Sometimes that's not a big problem, because once you learn that a
purple-berry is (or is not) a grape, you'll be okay. And there
aren't too many ways to interpret "purple" "berry". But "para-pe"
(or "para-fe", etc.) just doesn't work for me. There are too many
possible interpretations of "beside-person", and no particular reason
to nail it down as "neighbor".

We have...

EKO = dwell
HABITA = dwell
INKOLA = resident
KO-HABITA = live together
PARA = beside
PAROKIA = neighborhood
VICINA = neighborhood

And probably some others if I followed synonyms. I'd favor something
like "parokia-pe" or "para-inkola", which nicely bring together the
ideas of nearby+residence+people.

I have great fun every time I dig into that Glosa dictionary!
Just wish I could find the time and motivation to *write* in Glosa...

    And I disagree with your disagreement.  Where does that leave 
us? ;-)  Actually, I thought of 'para-pe' before I looked it up in 
the volume "Central Glosa: 5000 English into Glosa 1000 with
Etymological Notes."  It seems good enough to me.  Here we get into 
the thorny question of how much vocabulary is enough (and how much
specificity is specific enough)?  I wish I knew more about pidgins
(there is some about Tok Pisin on the www), which seem to do quite 
well with a limited vocabulary.

Teeheehee! Well, you've got the authors on you side. I'll just have to
use Literary Glosa when I talk about my neighbors.

Very thorny! No problem once you *learn* things like "para-pe" = "neighbor".
But if you have to *learn* them, then 1) you've lost some of the utility
of agglutination and 2) you might just as well have a separate word for
the term.

I'm afraid "para-pe" didn't come to me naturally. I need to include
something about "residence". To me, "beside-person" brings to mind
a spouse or co-worker (figurative) or the passenger sitting next to
me on a plane (literal).

Makes me wonder if agglutination-type wordbuilding really works well
between cultures that don't already have a lot in common. In the early
stages anyway. Once you're familiar with it, *any* language can work.
The question is, how long will it take to reach that point?

> ...I wish I knew more about pidgins

Yes, I *must* take a look at Tok Pisin someday. I keep hearing about it
but haven't yet found the time to investigate (or thought of it when I
did!).

Saluta,

I'd go for para-pe to loosely mean (home-)neighbour, co-worker, etc.,
but still allow para-inkola (cool word) when precision was required.

I strongly agree.  I only feel comfortable understanding a Glosa sentence when
I see the noun - verb boundary, and I detect this with my sense of English
language
(arghh) rather than some objective means.  Is the Vorlin.nu minimal grammar
approach
better than Glosa "no" grammar attempt??  I feel three types of word (or types of
word usage)...
1) adverb / adjective / gerund / noun
2) verb / preposition
3) interjection
The comma alone could maybe be used to distinguish these.

Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:
a strongly skilled woman
a strong skilled woman

    Why not just recast the phrase?  There is nothing writ large in the
nature of the universe which says says that any non-English language
has to mimic English word for word.  I would suggest that learners of
any non-native language avoid that habit of trying to translate word
for word.  This was drummed into me in elementary French class
thirty-seven years ago.

I like the Vorlin approach, but I'm not very familiar with Vorlin.
(Have you seen the new site at http://www.vor.nu/vornet/index.html?)
But the Glosa way is to use order within the sentence rather than affixes.

> Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:

> a strong skilled woman

Using Glosa's head-finalness, those three ideas in that order would
parse as...

   ( strong ( skill woman ) )

1) As Paul points out, you could rearrange the first sentence.

2) Or find an adverby Glosa word for the "strong" part, but I don't
   really like that idea.

3) How about linking the first two...

   a strong-skill woman

Saluta,

Adverbs are not just European, they are universal and are used to
provide a higher level of structure than simple linear {adjective}-noun.

Consider "a very good person" = ((big good) person)

A language needs somehow to identify the inner pair of brackets.  It could:
0) ignore them and use two sentences instead (too clumsy)
1) ignore them and let context assist (too risky)
2) dictionnary define some "(big" as a LINK-NEXT (ie adverb) rather
 than a LINK-LAST (ie adjective) (too much rote learning)
3) tag the space between big and good
 eg Esperanto:
    bona homo -> a good person
    multE bona homo -> a very good person (bigLY good person)
4) indicate the inner brackets
 eg Chinese:
    hao ren -> a good person
    hen hao DE ren -> a very good person
5) let the adverb be a declination on the adjective
 eg BSL
    gVoEoRdY person

Glosa could maybe use an affix, big-good person, but this mechanism is already
used
to form new words (para-pe etc)

Aaron.

Ahh, 'popina' = "cook-shop"; I found it in _Glosa 6000_.  Well, I cheat,
and my first port of call is the Langenscheidt _Shorter Latin Dictionary_:
this word has been lifted totally from Latin.

    popina, ae f cook-shop, eating house, low tavern; food sold at a 
     cook-shop. 

   I'd say the American "diner" or the Chinese "chop-suey joint" would
cover it; but, who would have thought the Romans coined the phrase, "Let's
pop-in for something to eat."

>The wind was blowing towards me and the bread smelled wonderful.

"a" --> "ad" only before a vowel; subsequent "pa" can be elided if
'pastness' is clear, and its absence aids flow and rhythm; similarly "u"
can be elided when the syntax clearly indicates an object, and its absence
aids rhythm.

is a "neighbour".  The "next-door neighbour" is more likely to be the

    I use the phrase 'comfortable in the mouth' to describe, to myself, how
a word feels as I say it: this factor has obviously been of enormous
significance in the linguistic drift that occurs from generation to
generation in the evolution of language 'in the wild.'
    There is every reason for retaining the use of  parokia , the less

surrounding area.

find the Perfect Past Tense both useful and significant, so I retain the

alternative usages for the Simple Past, in English, viz did run, has run,

     pa kurso - ran, did run, has run

*   More or less, so.  I would check the Functional Grammar books before
making any pronouncement, but there are two factors to juggle: different
Glosa words relating to time, and the gist/intent/emphasis being put across.
  nu  - at this moment  ................anywhere, depending on emphasis
  tem  - at the time, as, while, time(N)  ...  general 'time' word, used

  freqe  - often, frequently     /     but can be 'adverbs' at start
  usuali  - usually  ............. normally an 'adverb' before a 'verb'

    Because Glosa has a Syntax-based, Functional-type Grammar, word order
is strongly related to semantic significance, and, in general - in a simple
sentence - we can say the more important concepts come first.  Note the
difference in feeling between:-
    Nu, na nece akti u-ci.  .......... & .....  Na nece akti u-ci, nu.   
    Now, we must do this.  ...........   .....  We must do this now.

>6) Am I right in thinking there is little distinction between adjectives

    Glosa has two main word groupings: substantives (concept-words) and
function words.  The former comprise words with a distinct 'flavour', those
that have lexical strength; the latter comprise the small, finite group of
words that facilitate communication and clarify the relationships between
the substantives used.  [N.B. I avoid technical Linguistic terminology to
sidestep being caught in the snares of preconceived definitions.]
    The substantives can (within reason) function as any P-o-S, and this
usage is indicated by position.  So, the substantives can denote things,
actions or descriptions: Nouns, Verbs, or Modifiers.
    The standard Transitive sentence has S-V-O order, and this translates
into:-
  (S) Noun Phrase - (V) Verb Phrase - (O) Noun Phrase
--EG  U .... gina   .......... bate   un .......... andra.
----  U rusu gina   .....forti bate   u bruno derma andra.
  ________|________________|______________|_____|_________ (Modifiers)

Note: Here  derma  describes  andra  and is functioning as an adjective, so
the English equivalent of the phrase would be "the brown-skinned man".
    Also, in Glosa, modifiers precede the words they modify ... which does
cause trouble with some adverbs for speakers of English.  When 'thinking in
Glosa' one does not think of the 'adverb' last.

    About three of four years ago, when Conlang was the only 'constructed
language' List, the question of New Guinea pidgin came up, so I went to
Sydney U. to do a bit of reading about it.  My feeling is that the way NGP
combines the word-pool of English with the way New Guinea people think is
quite creative, but it looks distinctly like a compromise and a 'make do.'
Glosa, on the other hand is not a forced marriage of quite different
language traditions, and so ought to 
be consistent, streamlined ... and then creative.
    So, I guess I would say that the pidgin tradition does not, as far as I
can see, have anything to teach us about how to construct Glosa.
    But when it comes to the 'full' Glosa, then I believe we should have
more choice in the concepts we can use.  The whole range of possibilities
should be open to us:
  para-pe
  vicini-pe 
  parokia-pe
  proxi-pe
  ....
  cyber-ami
  nexu-pe
    How might I say, "We neighbour on the Net"?  Na nexu epi u Reti. ??

*   I know Paul sees the prescriptive use of all tense particles and all
articles as boring overkill and a serious case of Linguistic redundancy,
and I have been convinced that I should use a lighter hand where these are
concerned.
    But I am not convinced, yet, that 'omitting' "pa" and "u" is
Linguistically Correct (LC); it could still just be a case of 'heavy elision.'
    And so, I occupy the compromise position.  Although "pa-noktu" does set
the scene in the past, I believe that the first use of the tense particle
in a Verb Phrase is called for, and is LC ... prior to the omission of
following tense particles in the same sentence - as being either completely
'redundant', or optionally 'elided.'  And for naive learners, I would not
elide any of the function words.  Deb Pollard shows that she has intuited
this 'vernacular' usage, so I would not, now that Paul has convinced me,
suggest that she goes back to ^kindergarten^ by including the tense
particle in the second Verb Phrase.

    Were the missing parts, from this 'telegramatic' sentence, incorrect
omissions or serendipitous elisions?  People from the same linguo/cultural

that the correct usage should be taught at the start.

     The only function word I would feel happy with eliding, here, is the
second "fu".  I know which one of these two sentences I would teach to
learners as good Glosa, and which one I would correct.

    It's not merely a question of elision.  Some languages never use
them in the first place, so far as I know, so elision does not enter
into the picture.  Why is it somehow "right" for anglophones to use the
function words as in English and not for others to use Glosa as in
their native habits?

    I don't find anything at all wrong in this.  It differs from
English usage, yes, but why is it somehow "wrong"?  Are you taking the
linguistic-chauvinistic position that only the English way of doing
things is somehow "the right way"?

    Why does it have to be either/or?  Why can it not be correct in its
own right?

    I.e., speak like English.  Then why not have them put forth a
little more effort, learn English as the auxiliary, and put Glosa on
the rubbish heap?

    I will have to think about this one for a bit, just because I am
myself a native English-speaker and get involved in this all the time
without considering.  However, right off the top of my head I recall
some Russian adult learners of English who tended to use English tenses
as they seemed to think they would correspond to Russian aspect usage. 
For instance, I once heard one Russian consistently use "He has been
such-and-such" when a native anglophone would simply say "He was" for
someone who was dead.  In Russian, I suppose, one would use the perfect
aspect to indicate that something was over and done with, whereas in 
English we would not mark the aspect at all.  (English "He was" might
be used wither for a perfective or imnperfective aspect.)

*   The "para-pe" generic 'neighbour' is a "Glosa 1000" solution to the
problem of delimiting the lexicon.  How many neighbours, and hence
neighbourhoods, will be needed in a 'functional-enough' ~2K "Learners'
Dictionary"?
    While 'neighbour' conveys, in the abstract, "the next person", then
*para-pe* suffices.  But, there are so many cultural differences between
neighbourhoods around the globe, that we possibly have to decide if Glosa
will blandly lump them all into  para-pe  or whether we will have to go
specific so we can say,
EG  Mi ski holo mi plu para-pe, e plura de plu vicina-pe intra plu via;
proxi mi domi, sed mi ne ski holo plu parokia-pe; qi habita mi suburba.

   I know all of my immediate neighbours, and several of the local people
in the streets around my home, but I do not know all of the residents, who
inhabit my suburb.

Then, again, if we live in a village, we are more likely to say,
EG  Mi ski holo plu persona de mi viki: mu es holo para-pe a mi.  Mi dice
ko holo plu inkola de mi viki; e mi parokia extende a plu parokia-viki
intra u vicina.

    I know all of the people of my village: they are all neighbours to me. 
I speak to all of the residents of my village, and my neighbourhood extends
to the neighbouring villages in the vicinity.

*   Surely that is the intention in creating an open-plan language like
Glosa.  What we must do as a priority, is to sort out the 'optimal' number
of ''other-people'' grouping CONCEPTS needed for the first offering of a
language intended for a world of varied "other-people groupings."

    Step 1: think in Glosa.  Juggle the concepts you want to use, throw
them into the air, and let them fall .. as words in a sentence.

    My method of working is the Australian way, which is somewhat opposite

There could be a cultural difference between us at work, here.

The specificity, as I see it, is different for a *functional* dictionary
from more satisfyingly fuller dictionary.  I believe that we would do
better to be working at the concept level, than at the level of words.
    Agreed concepts are conveyed by words, but, somewhere along the line,
we need to decide on the match-up between concepts and words.  In my book,
the ideas which we want to convey should be primary to the words we use to
convey them.  I know this is not the way languages emerged in the wild;
but, now, with hindsight, and with some degree of urgency in seeking a
solution to the World Languge Problem, I think we need to go back to the
Roget approach, and look at language communication from the concept point
of view.
    Back at having discrete words for each concept vs. using agglutination
to form hyphenated compounds: Glosa is already a blend of both; and I feel
that we need to allow 'nature' to take its course, so that while there are
words derived using both methods, we ought to allow usage to sort out which
words will survive.  Even though compounding is part of the Glosa story, we
still need to understand the same thing from the same compound for
effective communication to occur.  My belief is that compounding works best
if the component words are well founded as concepts before compounding
takes place.  From this, the idea of word-translation dictionaries for
Glosa, does not assist in concept clarifictation, which needs the fuller
definitions found in normal dictionaries.
    With no grant for such work, we could seriously follow up the
suggestion, made by Paul, for more modifying words in the Glosa (word-list)
dictionaries, to allow a fuller understanding of the meanings intended for
Glosa words.

*   There is a place in our communication system for the 'generic'
"neighbour", and I feel that  para-pe  is as good as any, for this.  
    If sombody shouted, very loudly:
 Tena u manu de tu para-pe!  or more simply  Tena tu para-pe manu!

you would very quickly get the urgency of the situation, and grab the hand
of the person next to you.
    With less urgency, we very likely will want to be more specific about
who it is we relate to, and how far out from us the action, or
relationship, extends.  In such, more normal situations, a larger range of
choices would seem necessary .. both in relation to the people to whom we
are relating, and the distance from us, that the relationship extends.

I must see if we can find a group of non-Indo-European-based Glosa-pe who
are ready to enter into correspondence with Glosalist subscribers, for the
purpose of our 'using' the language to find answers to such questions.
    Such Glosa-pe would, however, be practising Glosa as it is, and would
not be likely to want to spend lots of time discussing Linguistic aspects
of the language.  I am not sure how many List members would be interested
in such field research: I know Paul would.

this language, and now feel I have invested part of my life in Esperanto,

Glosa, we do not have the luxury of expecting such a long lead-in time, so
the language needs to be much more immediately usable.  Rules of
compounding, and the relationships between component words probably need to
be spelled out.

In English, incorrect omissions. But when it comes to Glosa *used as an
IAL*, I'm in favor of the telegrammatic style that Paul advocates and
Chinese uses (well, Chinese is telegrammatic as compared to English,
though of course to the Chinese it's not telegrammatic at all!). The
very fact that the telegrammatic style works in telegrams is proof that
the extra words are, indeed, extra. And I think it would be much easier
for the student if such extra words were 1) not compulsory but were also
2) permissible, as long as the student understands that they might cause
confusion.

Thus, those whose native language does not use such words would not have
to learn this foreign way of speech, and those whose native language *does*
use them could simply be told to just try to speak more telegrammatically.

Extra words would also be quite useful in Literary Glosa.

Ah, I think I see! Your "neighbour" is generic, more inclusive, and
*could* mean "spouse", "co-worker", "passenger in the seat next to you",
or "person who resides next to you". Context would make that work. In fact,
it would be a very handy literary device. But if I were to say "See her?
She's my beside-person.", you really wouldn't know her relationship to me.
As with the example in the Basic Reference: "The woman; who is going
around the corner; is my neighbor.".

So, we're talking about two different things. You're talking about a
reflexive kind of situation, or a literary reference, but I'm talking
absolutely.

Yippee! We're both right, we both win!

Except for one thing. When somebody looks up "neighbor" in the dictionary,
what should the corresponding Glosa word be? Perhaps both "vicina-pe" and
"para-pe" should be listed, with the latter marked as "generic" or some
such thing.

Me too! It might be of more interest, though, to see how beginners deal
with it. As I said before, *any* language works once you learn it. The
practicing Glosafolk are using it as they have learned to use it. The
fact that it works doesn't prove that it is the best way or the easiest
to learn or to use. (Unless their style is *not* by the book. Deviations
would be of considerable interest!)

(Somebody once said that *anything* is regular if the rules are complicated
enough!)

I said...
> Once you're familiar with it, *any* language can work.
> The question is, how long will it take to reach that point?

...to which Robin replied...

(Since I realized our different approaches to the word "neighbor",
some of the specifics in the following paragraph aren't relevant,
but the logic still applies for explaining my lead-in-time remarks.)

Well, that wasn't quite the point I wished to make. As it stands, if I
learn "para" and "pe", I also have to learn what a "para-pe" is, because
it doesn't contain the concept of "residence" and thus doesn't mean
"neighbor" to me. I get three words for the price of three. But if I
learn "parokia" and "pe", then "parokia-pe" is pretty straightforward;
three words for the price of two. And I've also gained another link in my
mind to "para"! I believe that this sort of regularity would make Glosa
easier to learn, and without it, Glosa will suffer a long lead-in time.

Similar arguments can be made for "vicina-pe" and "inkola-pe".

This sort of analysis is why I have so much fun with the Glosa dictionary,
but it is also why I always burn out and have to put it away for a while!

*   Funny thing though, English has only five verbal inflections, and its
grammar is 50% Syntax-based.  This could be your reason, Aaron, for finding
English uncomfortably close to Glosa.  Glosa does the Syntax-based Grammar
thing right: in English, however, Syntax-based Grammar "sort-of" evolved,
and is still breaking away from the inflected German grammar that was added
by the Anglo-Saxons.

*   More information on Vorlin.nu required: some of us have only time for

structure and this is the foundation of its Syntax-based grammar.  We all
apologise for the mis-statment of "no MORPHOLOGICAL grammar" as "no grammar."

*   Without examples in Glosa or simple English, I cannot 'understand' this
schema.  No time to run through the combination of the all possible
interpretations that your groupings conjure up.
    Rearanging  1) , slightly, I give EG
 quickly running old man  (ADV/G/ADJ/N)
 celero kurso paleo andra

   This is the Noun Phrase minus its Determinant, "The" or "a" or "Several"
(U | plu).  Please note:  andra  does not agree in number with its
determinant  u  or  plu; also,  andra  is the only logical 'noun' in the
whole four-word group .. it is the 'culmination' of the Noun Phrase, and,
as such is the Linguistically 'Final' "Head," .... and the terminal
boundary of the Noun Phrase in Glosa.
   While the casual reader might say that all of these words are
substantives, and that the grouping is a "concept cluster" and, thus,
semantically too dense, I ask the non-casual reader to notice that the
words follow a clear-cut sequence of increasing significance, and that the
order is Syntactically correct, and cannot be changed.
    Aaron, I suggest that the most direct path to the Glosa truth is for us
to accept that words are basically all concepts, and that each concept
could concievably function as any part of speech: after having decided to
use this as a working hypothesis, we can then say that the surface
structure, or syntax, gives us the ^lie of the land^ and indicates the
particular way a word is being used in a specific instance (is it
incarnating as a verb, noun, modifier, or what); and, then, we apply
'hidden power' by allowing our "language centres" in the brain to go to
work, and sort out the deep structure, or semantics, of the sentence - to
*understand* what the sentence's words really mean.
    Perhaps speaking and writing Glosa is the reverse of the above process.

>Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:
>a strongly skilled woman
>a strong skilled woman
>
*   We will agree on  "U .............. gina."  but what goes between; and
even more importantly, does the rest of the message need to be tightly
squeezed into that space?
    And why should we not consider the possibility of 
 a skilled strong woman  and
 a skilfully strong woman  as well?

   There is an underlying pattern in all of these phrases:-
 LEAST IMPORTANT / MORE IMPORTANT / EVEN MORE IMPORTANT / MOST IMPORTANT

That is how it goes in English, and that is basically how it goes in Glosa.
But, in Glosa, without the "-ly", "-ed" and "-fully" Part-of-Speech
markers, we might need to be a bit more basic in our sentence structure -
not having the sophistication of using such inflections.
    We can juggle  forti  and  tekno - throwing words, instead of balls,
into the air - but we might, just might, have to spell out the relationship
between these concepts, to ensure that we have conveyed the right meaning.
    The need to think about what you want to say - before saying it - is, I
fear, the major ^culture-shock^ when entering Glosaland.  After achieving a
regularity of morphology .. for various believed advantages .. we then have
to pay the price of this 'elegance' by using a more *descriptive* style in
our sentence formation.  So, here are my attempts at the phrases in
question  EG
 a strongly skilled woman  ...  u gina; qi habe plu forti ge-developo tekno
 a strong skilled woman  .....  u forti, ge-tekno gina
    a skilled strong woman  ..  u ge-tekno, forti gina
    a skilfully strong woman    u gina; qi uti fe forti ko tekno

    Maybe, in English, we place the Adverb last because it is the remnant
of an elided Adverbial Clause.  ... purely an unsubstantiated theory.  In
Glosa, we have not had sufficient usage of the language to make such heavy
elision current, yet.  Perhaps it will come; but, for the moment, it is
probably best to *spell out* what we are trying to say, so that our
readers, or listeners, have no trouble in following our drift.

 Robin

progress of civilisation through reform of the language process.
 
    So, let me say straight out,
  u fo boni persona  =  a very good person

    Aaron, I believe that you have fallen into the trap, all too common in
Western Scholarship, of over-intellectualising the situation.  And here are
a few details backing up my sentence, above:-
   forti [strong]
   fo [strong (abbreviated form)]
   boni [good]  ..................are all 'modifiers', IE they add to the
meaning of another substantive, usually a 'noun' or a 'verb'.  However,
here, we see a modifier modifying another modifier: is this mouthfull
permissible in Glosa?  Of course it is.
   The only Grammatical Rule that the authors have published is:
     "A word is modified by its precedent."

   This is not much to go by, but it does lead directly into 'Head Final'
phrase structure - something I had to figure out for myself; it also tells
us that 
" ... fo boni ..." is OK.
   Is it a $good$ which is $very$, or do we suspend judgment, and wait to
see what the next word is, only to discover that we have a #person# who is
primarily #good#, and secondarily #very OR strongly so#?
   On top of all that, I would see a distinction between the concepts of
"big" and "very": we might describe somebody as 'Mr Big' but never as 'Mr
Very'; this suggests to me that there is a semantic category difference
between these concepts.  My guess is that  mega [big]  is a substantive
while  fo [very]  is a function word.  This probably explains why we are
more likely to read of a  fo mega andra  than of a  mega fo andra .
   I believe that your mathematical approach to language is not the right
one for understanding the structure of Glosa.  As children, we spend years
'understanding' how we are supposed to juxtaspose words in our sentences,
then, as educated adults, we carry on, as normal, 'knowing' that the way we
sequence our words in sentences is 'obviously right.'
   What makes both Chinese and English hard for learners is the
'naturalistic' uninflected grammar.  Glosa ^joins the club^ - only moreso -
with NO inflections, and a word order that is also assumed to be close to
the 'natural.'
   The difference between the two natlangs and Glosa is that the natlangs
evolved, or devolved, to their 'natuarlistic', mainly uninflected, forms,
while Glosa was 'hatched' under ^pressure-cooker^ conditions to simulate
this 'naturalness' in language.  Did Clark and Ashby get it right: are they
even close?  Only practice will tell!
   Hence, in my understanding of the R&D situation, as it applies to Glosa,
we are now in the "Application" (or Verification) stage of the language's
development.  As such, I am very interested to see how the language fits
the mouths of common people .. as it is.  The authors assumed that the
language was ready to be picked up by the man, woman and child in the
street, but they had not taken into account the Linguist in the road.

>A language needs somehow to identify the inner pair of brackets.  It >could:
>0) ignore them and use two sentences instead (too clumsy)
*  Agreed about the clumsiness, but not that language contains the
mathematical sort of bracketting that you suggest.

>1) ignore them and let context assist (too risky)
*  The authors trusted the people's cerebration more than you do; this was
the sort of risk they were prepared to take.

>2) dictionnary define some "(big" as a LINK-NEXT (ie adverb) rather
> than a LINK-LAST (ie adjective) (too much rote learning)
*   As stated above, the authors go for each word in a phrase impinging on
the next, sequentially ... seeing concepts affecting concepts in a forward
direction, rather than Adverbs modifying Adjectives, as we have been taught
to do in English.

>3) tag the space between big and good
> eg Esperanto:
>    bona homo -> a good person
>    multE bona homo -> a very good person (bigLY good person)
*  With all respect to Esperanto, I see that as their problem.  Glosa tries
to see the "good person" as simply a  boni persona [good person], and a
"very good person" as a  fo boni persona [very good person].
    No *tag* seems necessary, or correct, to impede the modification
process in Glosa.

>4) indicate the inner brackets
> eg Chinese:
>    hao ren -> a good person
>    hen hao DE ren -> a very good person
*   Though I do not follow what is happening, here, in Chinese, I am going
to ^play^ the "Recency Card" and say that, with hindsight, and the benefit
of recent thinking in Linguistics (since it became a 'science'), the Glosa
authors have ''streamlined'' language usage as much as they feel people can
bear, and have attempted to iron out the wrinkles that have built up,
through usage, in the national languages.

>5) let the adverb be a declination on the adjective
> eg BSL
>    gVoEoRdY person
>
>Glosa could maybe use an affix, big-good person, but this mechanism is
>already used to form new words (para-pe etc)
>
*   fo  is already an affix; this case was argued by some in previous
discussions in the Conlang list.  There is no hyphen, and  fo  has the
structure of a full word, but it is bound to the following word by the
mythical Rules of Syntax; so, in Glosa we have the best of both worlds.
    Though there might possibly be a BSL, I would have a lot of trouble
speaking it, with its UPPER/lower case mix, so I suspect that you are
finishing off your blip with an EXfTRuEMnELnYy joke.

Yes, but while examining the Glosa 6000 I came across things like...

 AMI = friend
 AMIKA = friendly
 FILEMON = friendly or loving

 EKINO or SOLOX = bristly
 HORIDO = bristling
 KAETA or SETA = bristle

...which may just be misleading, but it appears to indicate that some
words are to be thought of as adjectives, some as nouns, etc. Could AMI
be used as an adjective, or AMIKA as a noun? Well, probably, particularly
if used to form a compound. So perhaps what we've discovered here is that
there is yet another group of hidden synonyms in Glosa. Oh no!

This well-turning could be tricky though, and critical, because if any
word can be any part of speech, how can you know when you've reached the
end of the phrase? (Reminds me of the old joke about spelling "Mississippi":
I *know* how to spell it; I just don't know when to stop!) One has to make
a determined effort to somehow mark the Head of the "Head Final". A "pa"
marking the beginning of the verb phrase would certainly mark the end of
the noun phrase. Or the first word that could not logically be used as a
noun could perform the same function. This gives a lot of importance to
the words that cannot logically be interpreted as any part of speech (can
somebody think of a good word for that?) in a language that is based on
words that can!

That's *exactly* how I'd do it. It creates a little head-final kind of
compound word and then applies it to another word in a head-final phrase.

To me, those two uses are the same.

I don't think of compound words as separate words in their own right; at
least, I don't think they should be. If the root words are precise enough,
and the compounds are created carefully enough, then the meaning of a
compound should be obvious. But I have retained many compounds in the
dictionary (and added some for completeness) because 1) sometimes the
compounds are *not* obvious (purpleberries!) and 2) I think they make
the dictionary more useful.

Would (3) really be indeterminate? I'd say it's the same as (4). With no

the *things* begin with the head and accumulate backward. But I could
also argue for ((FORTI TEKNO)GINA) (GINA is modified by TEKNO, but TEKNO
is first modified by FORTI).

By modifiers, do you mean that they are *Modifiers* or that they are acting
as modifiers in this sentence? Could "forti" or "boni" ever be the Head?
When it is said that "Glosa words can be used, within reason, as any part
of speech", I fear that maybe I'm not sufficiently reasonable!

What's bothering me tonight is: Glosa seems to have an awful lot of words
that *cannot* act as *any* part of speech. And they seem to be necessary,
since there is no other way of marking the heads of the phrases. Is it
*possible* to have a head-final concept-word language with no method of
marking the heads? 

(That's why I say that I probably push this concept-word idea farther
than the authors had in mind.)

Another troublesome aspect: if FORTI and its synonyms cannot be used
as nouns, and the nouns are just nouns and the verbs just verbs, then
we are left with ROBORA for the verb and VIS for the noun. Beauty, but
not simplicity. Three forms of the same concept without any obvious
relationship. It seems to me that it might be simpler to learn a regular
inflection or a handful of POS markers/affixes to apply to concept-word
roots. In fact, couldn't one say that the FORTI/ROBORA/VIS example
demonstrates a highly irregular and inflected language?

    It is obvious that we have different *beliefs* about what would be best
for the world: now we really need to get feedback from people from other
linguo-cultural groups, to see what they say, as a result of practical
experience.
    I will take this as a top priority matter - finding addresses of
Glosa-pe who are able to respond to us, in Glosa, from around the globe.

*   I do want to know: is Glosa a telegramatic language with extra words
added for the convenience of learners; or is it a fully-featured language

in the learning situation, and from cultural influences.   We can try to
standardise the former, but the latter is a given, that must be reckoned

*   These statements are relevant to the Glosa situation.  The authors have
purposely not printed a Grammar Book, and have published only one
grammatical rule: that a word is modified by its precedent.  This has shown, 
among the Third World Glosa-pe, that the language does live even without a
^smack on the bottom^ from a heavy grammar-book.  However, this experiment
has proved counter-productive among the First World would-be-Glosa-pe, who
feel that Glosa needs a ^life support system^ to make it live, for them.
    The Ugandans are using Glosa "not by the book", because there is
virtually no book to go by.   I was asked by Peter Kwagala for some help
with a few "seminars" on Glosa's usage, and that was in 1995; after a
serious lapse, I will resume the process, with 'Seminar #2', ' .. #3', and
so on.
    As an experiment run under very extreme conditions, I feel that Glosa
showed, with statistical significance, that it works without complicated
rules.  However, the experiment was, I feel, very costly - in that for
those not in "extreme conditions" an un-Booked Glosa did not reach the
significance level, of workability.
    And that's where we are, now, in the Glosalist: I am trying to vivify
Glosa with "life support" in an ad hoc manner.  The modification of a " 'no
grammar'" Hypotesis 1, is a "syntax by seminars" Hypothesis 2.  This second
experiment ought to gain an even higher significance rating for Glosa's
workability in the Third World, and might even raise workability to
significance in the First.

IMHO much closer to this now that we were in 1881, when Esperanto kicked
off.  It is my belief that Glosa needs to enable people to reach fluency
quicker than does Esperanto, because there may not be 'five years' between
now and when the machinery for IAL adoption is set in place, with, of
course, the major player in the 'highly probable' slot.

the "neighbour" moity can be sorted out very quicly, as it seems to have

suitable qualifiers.  How do I translate "next-door neighbour" into Glosa,
anyway?  Possibly ~para-domi-pe~ simmers down to ~para-do-pe~.
    Bill, you are putting up the case for spefic terminology, and fairly
regularised rules for the derivation of words; I seem to be quoting the
case for flexibility in concept-building.  I have the feeling that this is,
as you observed earlier a win-win situation: some people will use Glosa in
the concrete, and others will, as happens with most modern languages,
polarise their usage to the abstract; with time, and suitable
encouragement, others, again, will discover that they have, within Glosa,
the flexibility to chose the specificty of the word they want to use.
    But getting back to basics, we cannot hit Glosa learners on the head
with the Glosa equivalent of the Full Oxford English Dictionary.  I feel
that we should be fairly specific and restricted in range, in the Glosa
Staters' Dictionary, but that there ought to be a few non-specifics
included, to show learners that abstraction is alive and well in Glosa, also.

*   Firstly, I would say that in general use, the basic rule as enunciated,
above, holds for most of the Glosa lexicon.   
    While  amika  and  filemon  may be Classical synonyms, perhaps this
represents a historical cultural difference, with the Greeks being more
affectionate in their friendliness.
    I have tried to avoid the ^square corner^ approach in my use of the
Glosa lexicon, and have, possibly slackly, used  ami  and  amika  almost
interchangably, choosing whichever felt best in a particular sentence.  The
alternative view is that  amika  is the full substantive word, while  ami
is the abbreviated form.

*   I think we are falling down the crack between 'syntax' and 'semantics.'
The Glosa rules relate to syntax; and, on an Internet List, like this one,
the syntax can be seen - easily - on screen, but the semantics are not so
readily discerned.  My guess is that Semanticists have had a lot to say
about lexical items that are 'dedicated' to functionas only one part of
speech.  And I would guess that at a later phase of Glosa research, we will
give the language the full treatment of Semantic analysis, possibly along
the lines of Functional Grammar.  However, at present, I go along with the
authors, and am trying to get away with letting the brain of the Glosa-pe
sort it out.
   If any word could possibly function as any part of speech, but, in
reality, we know that many words don't, then for normal language usage we
are guided by common sense in this.  We have "But me no buts!" but not "To
me no to-es."
   I still find it very convenient (not a good Linguistic term) to use
inverted commas when assigning a word its Part-of-Speech in Glosa, EG
   Kurso dona mega hedo.
    kurso - 'noun' (= word functioning as a NOUN)
    dona  - 'verb' 
    mega  - modifier: 'adjective'
    hedo  - 'noun'

Most of these words can function as other Parts-of-Speech:  kurso  is
usually a 'verb';  dona  can be an 'adjective' or even a 'noun; we usually
see  hedo  in its 'adjective' [happy] incarnation, but it can be a 'noun'
[hapiness] as here.    mega  will only very seldom, if at all, be a thing
or an action, so is dedicated to the "comparative" function and will almost
always be an 'adjective', or rarely, an 'adverb'.  Lumping all such
'dedicated' words into the "funtion word" category might be a bit crass,
but it lets us get on with seeing Seantics in two broad categories: but is
this enough of a classificatory division?  Some words are always verbs, and
others always prepositions; while the authors believe that people have the
language ability to sort these categories out automatically, is this
classification something we should be doing now?  Personally, I believe
that attempting to use the language in all its uncertainties, is more
important, at present, than dotting every "I" and crossing every "T",
metaphorically speaking, of course.

    I suspect that most people will use Glosa without realising that there
is a problem with identifying the "Head", or with wondering how far the
function of a word can spread.

                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Likewise, "boni" is the Head of a phrase here.

    Yes, in trying to make the rules for words universal, the authors have
possibly over-generalised the situation.  I am certain that they were
expecting the 'man, woman and child' in the street to apply their inherent
linguistic abilities to the situation, knowing that, for example, they
could not used "ad" as a verb.  
    One can list all of the possible P-o-S usages of a word, and this would
be a proper way for computer programmers to go about doing it.  The
_Collins Cobuild Essential Dictionary_ does just this: it has a special
column down the side in which the exact P-o-S usage is noted for every
listing of a word; it makes the whole language thing very complicated.

trying to put his finger on the non-agglutinative solution.

Oooh, I need to take a look at that! (Yep, I'm a programmer, that's me.)
But does it actually make language more complicated, or less, or even
have no effect at all? Maybe just makes language *appear* more complicated.
One way of looking at it (descriptively) is that such a dictionary merely
codifies practice. If you're unsure, you can look it up. It may look
difficult seen all together at once, but it's really just a textbook
description of what folks are saying anyway. Well, perhaps I should say no
more until I actually look at it!

It's just a dictionary problem. If you look up "strong", you find "forti"
but not the others; if you look up "strengthen" you find "robora" but not
the others; if you look up "strength" you find "vis" but not the others.
They are, of course, synonyms (eek!), but to users whose language is not
concept-word-oriented, the segregation makes it appear that these are
different forms of the same word, but wildly different from one another.

Synonyms don't make irregularity. (It was a joke! (That was the thesis!)
(But it could go something like this...))

Root word (noun): VIS = strength

To form a verb: If the leading character is V, drop the leading V- and
append -ORA, the verbal suffix. Substitute R for leading vowels. If two
consonants are found to be adjacent, replace the second with -OB- since
this is easier to pronounce. Thus, "robora". (If the leading character
is not V, see page 231, paragraph 4.)

To form an adjective: If, during construction of the verbal form, a
secondary consonant was replaced by the -OB- infix, then begin by dropping
the final consonant, if the word contains a consonant. See Table XIII
for consonantal shifts; in this case, F replaces leading V. And remember,
whenever a word might consist of only a consonant and a vowel, the infix
-ORT- (Organic Recyclable Trash, according to my daughter, or "leaving,
refuse" in Old or Middle English, I can't remember which and can't find
my source) must be inserted between them. Thus, "forti".

And I before E except where it isn't.

*   The Cobuild approach is 'descriptive', whereas other dictionaries are
'prosriptive', telling us how we ought to use the language.  School
teachers prefer the latter, which uses th older authoritarian paradigm.

*    I prefer not to think of playing games with the synonyms, especially
imagining infixes to the Glosa words: I doubt that we can find any way of
warping "vis" to "robora" to "forti", even non-seriously after a long day
at work.  Have you suffered the Linguistic variety of "snow-blondness",
called "word-blindness" as a result of spending too long over the Glosa
word-lists?

     The antidote to word-blindness is writing letters in Glosa to
Africans.  In time, as I get permission from the Africans, I will publish
contact details of such antidotes on this list.

Plu Amika,
     Mi grafo a vi ko plu nova de u neo "Seminar" te bali a plu Afrika
Glosa-pe.

     U-ci dokumenta sio debi ki a plu Glosa-pe; qi habe nuli Inter-reti nexu.  

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

 [ Sadly, after a long absence, Greetings,
   I write to you, friends in my work of language reform.
   All of my life I have seen the insides of a hospital about twice.  But
last week, I went to Saint Vincents Hospital to have angioplasty. 
   This action has a filament probe inserted in my body through the vein in
the top of my leg, and then moved into my heart.  Using X-rays, the doctor
sees the blood vessels of my heart - to find any restriction - by putting a
dye inside these arteries.
   When the doctor located a restriction in one of these arteries, he used
a different probe to place a small metal-wire tube, named a "stent", inside
this occluded heart vessel.  The special metal filament opened inside the
blood vessel, and caused it to become wider.  This magic is called
"angioplasty", and it allows me to work again.
   In the future, I will eat better food, and will get more exercise.  I do
not wish to have angioplasty again, and will try to reduce the cholesterol
inside my blood vessels. ]

 Saluta,
  Robin

*    Thank you Bill,
       Apart from the collection of little white tablets, the new total
vitamin/herb/mineral tablet, and the Chinese herbs I am boiling up, it
almost feels as I havn't been away.
       I know that life changes AA (After Angioplasty) and one starts
valuing every single day much more than BA.

       All three doctors who were involved in getting my artery unblocked
(GP, Specialist and Surgeon) did a good job as far as it went.  None of
them volunteered information on the need for me to change diet and exercise
regime, so I found the hospital's Cardiac Rehabilitation Unit, and sought
Ancient Chinese assistance in dissolving away the fat in the arteries to
get them supple again.  The starting on the total nutrient tablet at the
same time was simply a co-incidence.
      So, Bill, if you or any other Glosalist readers want to be
disgustingly healthy, let me know, and I will contct you personally.

      I was off work for two weeks, with the first week being the worst -
when I did not know how severe the problem was.  At St Vincents Hospital,
they do the Angiogram to see how many arteries are blocked, and if there is
only one, they push right on with the insertion of the "stent" to widen it.
 I was lucky: after one night in hospital, I walked home the following
morning with my new 'bionic'
wire-mesh tube in place.
     Now I have to take life seriously, if I am not to return to hospital -
hence my decision to use the Chinese herb path back to health.  Finding
time to walk for half an hour each day is proving to be the hardest part.

     Back at Language Reform, I still have to start recording a cassette
for Ocan Jakeo at Kitgum in Uganda, and I will push ahead to do a version
of Glosa 6000 (E -> G) with a minimum of synonyms.  I promised to send him
more learning materials just prior to my being out of action.

     Since returning to 'normal' I have found the Language Reform work a
bit slow: possibly it is because I am valuing each day more.  I will start
writing to Third Worlders agin, but turn around times are so much slower -
owing to the speed of pidgeon post and to stamp costs.  The Glosalist has
slowed to a trikle,
and I must attempt to re-breathe life into it.  Suggestions from Glosalist
"lurkers" are greatly welcomed.

      My current thought is for people to 'retell' their favourute
children's stories in Glosa.  I have suggested this to people in Uganda,
but with no feedback, yet.

      As some people know, we are having a Federal election in Australia,
and I have been a bit active with this: normally, I just let 'them' get on
with it; but this time the sale of national assets to foreign interests has
just about got out of hand, and it all patriots to the pumps.
      There's no reason for Language Reformers to know about the MAI
(Multilateral Agreement on Investment), and it is even a better-kept secret
than the Australian election.  But it is potentiall much more disastrous:
Australia will be standing beside Uganda - as a Third World country - when
we can no longer service our foreign debts, and it is very hard to get
facts on this.  We might already have passed the point-of-no-return to
national solvency.
      For those who have heard of our rogue 'bull-in-a-chinashop'
politician, Pauline Hanson, my vote to-day, in favour of her One Nation
Party, will be a "protest vote" against the two major parties that have
sold us out - mainly to the Americans.
      Heaven help us if Pauline gets a landslide victory in to-day's poll:
we will become isolationist, like Malaysia, in a rapidly globalising world.
 We will be slated by the Asians for reducing immigration - though
unemployment is at 8% - and our multinationals are all likely to withdraw
their investment.  The only plus will be that Hanson has not, as yet,
agreed to work for our foreign masters, as have the leaders of the other
parties.  Australia would be better to go it alone like Brazil: I am not
holding my breath on this one, but am hoping for an upset like the one that
netted One Nation 11 of the 89 seats in Queensland, in the recent state
election; this fact was also kept out of the world's media.
      One could say that the Australians are revolting.

>He who fights & runs away will live to fight another day.
>
*    I am doing this with my health, but we might not be so lucky with the
Australian economy.

     It would be a bit hard to put all the above into Glosa, but I'm sure
it can be done.  More genuine Language Reform after the election.

Saluta,
 Robin

   [As you possibly know, the forming of sentences in Glosa is based on
that of English.  But, Glosa does not equal <is not> the word for word
translation of English into the Glosa vocabulary.  Glosa uses the logic of
well-formed English sentences, and, thus, reading Glosa ought to feel like
reading grammatical English sentences.]

  [Originally, I hoped to find other people, who would enjoy writing to
Third World Glosa-pe, who have no Internet connection.  And I again ask:
would you possibly enjoy writing, using English and Glosa, to others, who
also value the idea of an International Auxiliary Language, but from the
opposite economic extreme than us with our Net connections?]

// XXX Remark -- New message:
................................................................
From: Robin Gaskell
Subject: Letter to Banobi
To: Glosalist Mailing List
Date: Mon, 26 Oct 98 18:0

Friends,
   A long ways from here, there are some Africans getting on with Glosa ..
despite an extreme shortage of money, and being off the map as far as the
international dialogue goes.

   Banobi Herbert met Wendy Ashby earlier this year in the Italian town of
Verona, and he is one of the Community Development Officers appointed by
the Ugandan Government to stimulate and install local enterprise in the
Ugandan hinterland.  The idea is that if your country has no money and no
standing in the international marketplace, you might as well appoint gifted
people to do whatever they can to stimulate commercial activity throughout
the countryside.

   So, what's Banobi doing?  Heard of the Mountain Gorillas of Uganda?
Tourists travel from all over the world to Rukungiri to see the Mountain
Gorillas, and guess who is running the show?  As well as providing a
tourist facility allowing people to see the Mountain Gorillas, Banobi has
seen this as an opportunity to tell visitors about the gorillas in Glosa as
well as in English.  People learning about the gorillas can learn about a
strange new world tongue, as well.

   Needless to say there are some problems with Glosa promotion in Uganda:
because of the shortage of money, there is less chance of co-ordination
between the Glosa groups than we might have expected.  A high level of
co-ordination was achieved by Onen Smith, but unfortunately he died a
couple of years ago, and, since then, no-one has been able to repeat Onen's
shoestring diplomacy.  Banobi Herbert has done very well, however, to have
gained one of the few NGO Certificates issued by his government: with this,
he can import overseas technical equipment without having to pay Uganda's
very high Import Duties.  We are working on this.

   I include a copy of this reply to Banobi's letter, which was also in
Glosa, as an example of Glosa in action - to demonstrate the language used
in a realworld situation, and as mild reading exercise for Glosa-pe on this
List.

   Most of our Glosa contacts in Uganda are Community Development Officers,
and I do hope to interest other First Worlders in the exciting work of
promoting Glosa in the Third World.  However, these people have extremely
limited resources and are interested in the logistics of promoting an
auxiliary language in a coultry that is predominatly pre-industrial.  As
practical people, they have little time for discussion of the linguistic
side of language.  Any takers?

Saluta,
 Robin
P.S. I trust that the "Attached" letter is readable to your system.  If
not, and you wish to see the letter, I will have to try some tricks to get
it into normal mail format.   R.G.

Hello Friends,
  And welcome to new subscribers to this List.

    Years ago, while still in England, and in direct contact with Ron Clark
(circa 1979), I mused on possible ways of creating Glosa learning games.
    If Glosa words do not change morphologically to show AGREEMENT, then I
deduced that sentence phrasal elements could mix and match without having
to add  "-ed"s or "-es"s onto the ends of words - as long as internal
consistency of number and tense was maintained.
    Take a Glosa sentence, cut it up into its building blocks of phrases,
then start constructing new sentences from these elements by swapping them
around. 
    To make a point-scoring game of it, I chose the model of Scrabble", but
renamed it "Scribble" because we would build sentences from phrases (and
words) instead of words from letters.  Thus _Skribel_ or _Kruci-Frasa_ was
invented.

    Below, in Eudora format, is a series of dismembered sentences - with a
few joining words added as a leaven - for you to print out in hard copy,
cut up into "tiles", and then start _Skribel_ing with.  Feedback requested,
please.  A copy of _Skribble_, an English Language version of the game, is
"Attached".
    Skribel works perfectly with Glosa because "Glosa words do not change
for reasons of grammar."  _Aussie Lingo_ works quite well in English,
because we can choose to provide "tiles" that carry no inflecting words.
Could you learn French or Italian using this system?  Who know: I might
find out in a couple of years when my computer programming skills are up to
it.

    But where do you come in, and what is the pay-back for Glosa of your
playing this childish game?  Well, Banobi Herbert, in Uganda, has set up
the Rukungiri Mountain Gorilla tourist facility, and promotes Glosa through
the sales outlet attached to his establishment.  Why not, I thought,
suggest to Banobi that a suitable Glosa sentence-building game could be
both a teaching aid and a sales item.
    Through your playing Skribel, you could:-
 . help me to refine the game as it stands;
 . contrbute phrases to the general pool, and thus, contribute indirectly
  to the economic recovery of Africa;
 . contribute to the GEO, because royalties from sales of the Glosa
   version of the game, with your phrasing, will go to the Glosa Charity;
 . learn to form Glosa sentences without really trying; 
 . discover the truth of syntax-based grammar through direct participation
   in it.

    I will send the ASCII version of the phrases to Banobi, and will ask if
a suitably presented game might having economic value for him.  I will, of
course, mention that I have requested help with this project from Glosalist
subscribers.
       Sentences can grow by addition, and might stretch form one wall to
the other; but, although the sentences do not have to make logical sense
(see Glen Baxter), they must be grammatically correct, and have to be read
aloud with sufficient vocal inflection to make them seem 'believable.'
 ADVERTISEMENT: Entrepreneurially-minded subscribers who can see commercial
possibilities in the English Language versions of the game are invited to
contact me about such possibilities (Aussie Lingo, Ultra Lingo, Primary
Sentences, Crost-verbs, Yuppie Speak, etc).

POTTED RULES:-
 * Each player issued 10 tiles; replaced from stock when tiles used.
 * Player 1. places sentence horizontally; says it aloud  - it stays in
   place if accepted as grammatically correct by other players.
 * Player 2. builds a new sentence perpendicularly, incorporating an
   existing tile.
 * Play continues, criss-crossing or extending existing sentences until
   tiles are exausted or no-one can place tiles.
 * Scoring: one point per tile for all tiles in the new sentence, this is
  multiplied by the number of existing sentences crossed by the new
sentence.

Let play commence.

Saluta,
  Robin

*   So, charles,
   If you - and any other newly subscribed person on the List - send me
your land address, I will send you the IBM ASCII version of the Glosa 6000
dictionaries (with word translations both ways).
   More work is required especially in the English --> Glosa direction:
most (or all) of the Classical synonyms ought to be cut back, leaving only
one root as the preferred (or sole) Glosa word.
   Bill Patterson has created a list of English words - not in the Glosa
6000 dictionary - for which he would expect to have Glosa equivalents.  I
started working on this list but found it very slow going.  I use a short
Latin 
dictionary, and am struggling with a Moder Greek dictionary, as well.

   Once a standardised, two-way Glosa 6000 dictionary is set up without any
inbuilt inconsistencies, then we can set about reducing the lexicon to what
seems a more rational length for beginners (1500, 2000 or 3000 words), and
we can also release such a production on the Net.

   I wish to complete this project, to make room for others, such as the
production of a series of sound cassettes, and the publication of Glosa
readers for the benefit of learners.  After such learning materials are
standardised, and inconsistencies removed, then we can progress to creating
graded instruction for the stepwise learning of Glosa.

   As a first exercise, I would ask subscribers to compile a list of the
criteria on which to base their selection of words for a first Glosa
dictionary.
   Memory . utility . literary value . international discussion and
co-operation  . world development . tourism . trade and commerce . science
and technology .  
 health and quality of life . ease of pronunciation . relevance of the
concept??

Saluta,
 Robin

I have them now, and they are very interesting;
I write Perl scripts and use unix "grep" and "sort" programs
to compare and contrast with other online dictionaries.

I think the Latin dictionary approach is not so good.
Glosa started as Greek-root-based, but now over half of
the words are either just Latinate, or both Latin and Greek.
But I found that most of the work of vocabulary selection
from Latin has already been done for us, in Ido:

First, comparing the Glosa 1700 from Paul's page with the Ido 2000
list from James Chandler, I merged them into ...
http://www.catty.com/~catty/lang/idoglosa.htm
... and found remarkable similarity in the roots.

Then, I merged a larger Ido 3600 word dictionary with Glosa 6000,
and was amazed at how many, um, inopportune entries need to be
cleansed from the latter. But most of Bill's/Paul's missing words
have appropriate cognates in Ido, which after all was a cleanup
pass of Esperanto by Couturat and Jesperson.

This is eminently do-able.

I would want the vocab to avoid using the terminal vowel
to disambiguate terms. Please! A simple consonant-vowel-consonant
or CvCvC pattern for common (top 10,000) word roots is both
adequate and mnemonic ... the final vowel is going to be
indistinct and inaudible in real connected speech.

    On of the major hurdles of dictionary work is the sheer
manipulation of entries.  It seems as if charles has a good handle 
on using effective tools.

    Just as an aside for manipulating Glosa's vocabulary, there is
nothing Writ Large in the Nature of the Cosmos that says that English
and Glosa words have to map onto each other one for one.  In fact, it
is even conceivable that trying to do so could be something of a trap
or hurdle for learners and leaves Glosa-pe open to the charge that
Glosa is merely recoded English, in which case why not learn the "real
thing"?

Subject: 1st Person, Singular, Non-sexist Pronoun
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 98 15:4

Hi Friends on the Glosalist,
    In an attempt to keep the ball rolling in this list, I have thought up
a number of topics for consideration.
    Here is one:-  How will speakers of the IAL get around the matter of
gender, for singular pronouns, when the sex of a person is not known?

    In English we use "they" or if pushed, "he/she".  Taking Glosa as the
example of an auxiliary language, what could it be?

   mu [they] - following English's number bending
   an [he]  - assuming the old-fashioned male dominance
   fe/an [she/he] - being modern and emancipated
   pe [person-it] - being completely neutral and giving "pe" pronoun status

   and tricky gender benders mix and match the letters from "an" and "fe"
   fa [sh-im] - F(e)&A(n) .. taking the initial letters, and combining them
   en [he-sh] - (f)E&(a)N .. doing the same with the final letters

    How does the rest of the world solve this problem?
    Will Glosa-pe follow English speakers, and use "mu"?
    Must a specific solution be found?

    I feel that the possible solution that would be most consistent with
the rest of Glosa, and which would not be introducing odd usages is "pe".

Saluta,
 Robin

When I was on The Well, they used "pern" for gender-neutral;
"pe" sounds good to me for Glosa.

Greek-root-based, even if you go back to Interglossa.  When I first saw
Glosa in 1977, it was predominantly Latin-based.  
    The authors wanted the best of both (old) worlds, and strived to
include Greek and Latin synonyms, where possible, if this did not cause a
clash elsewhere in the lexicon.

basic level, but Glosa becomes more Greek influenced at the broader level.
I recall Ron Clark's rationalisation for this: he said that the Greek roots
were were more abstract and permitting of complex word-building than the
Latin words, which were more concrete and specific, and less prone to
contribute towards the melded compounds.

roots, or not, and thus indirectly indicating the optimum length of a
"Starter Dictionary."
    The official Glosa line on the (Cv)x structure is a sop thrown to the
Asians.  It was claimed that Asians in general spoke 'sing-song' languages 
whose words comprised one, or more, "Cv" units.
    I have observed this subsequently, after moving into the Sydney suburb,
Cabramatta - now dubbed Vietnamatta: *Hughes Street* becomes ~Hyu Stree~.
    And the Chinese chap, who moved into my second bedroom as a paying
guest and live-in English student, genuinely started off adding -EE to the
ends of most words that ended in consonants.  Trying to eliminate these
unwanted gratuitous terminal vowels proved to be a constant source of work.
    So, my experience, regarding a terminal consonant is just the opposite
of your observation.  It seemed to me that most with the background of an
Asian language expected words to terminate in vowels, and had trouble
stopping a word on a consonant.  
    On the question of disambiguation, there are not a lot of Glosa words
that differ only on their terminal vowels, so this is not as much a problem
as it might be.  According to the Glosa 6000 dictionary, there are even a
few Glosa words with identical spelling: the original intention was that no
two words should be spelt the same; however, in the light of reality and
etymological research, the authors found it hard to avoid these words
differing only by their terminal vowel, and even homonyms, in an
aposteriori conlang .. especially when the lexical source is only two
ancient languages.

*   Extremely true, and yet a falacy that the present form of the Glosa
dictionaries leads us into.  I know that a "word translation dictionary"
really is a confusion of terms, and, yet, the Glosa authors would still
have been working on completing "6000" had they set themselves the task of
writing a proper dictionary.

*    And so, we are even asking people to 'map onto' each other linguistic
units that are from unmatching categories: aficionados of English never
asked you to believe that their favourite language was a "concept
language"; but the Glosa authors have asked you to ^hold your breath^ while
percieving the Glosa words really as 'concept centres' rather than as
concrete representions of ideas.
    Perhaps the analogy might be the way that musical sounds 'map onto'
musical notation.  The Glosa words really are meant to be thought of as
'concept-words', suggesting that when we use Glosa we are ^sculpting^ in
meaning, rather than flatly manipulating 'labels'.
    Needless to say, I see many users of English as simply using labels, in
a rather unpoetic sort of way; while, still, I understand that the top
novelists and song-writers are recognised to be using English words in
highly creative ways - projecting the essence of meaning through them.
    I do believe that the Glosa authors sought to breathe this poetic
essence into the language they were creating.  This does not mean that you
have to be a poet to use Glosa, but, as in all languages, it helps.
    When I pondered the original Hogbenism that the modelling of semantics 
is the concept usage of language in Chinese, I did wonder what a "concept
language" was.  On questioning Chinese people about this and looking into
the ideas behind classical Chinese literature, I came to the conclusion
that, when the Chinese language was first formed, it was planned to be a
creative medium.  This was the only conclusion I could reach when
discovering that scholars had to teach learners the right way to interpret
Chinese texts: the words must have been being used poetically rather than
technically.  English, on the other hand, has been moving progressively
towards 'plain language.'
    The Glosa authors have tried to create a language medium that gives
people the opportunity of expressing themselves both in the modern
technical way as well as in the more traditional creative mode.  Whether
this revolution in language can be achieved through freeing the words of
inflection and centring the grammar on syntax (or even if I have read the
signs correctly) I cannot know.  However, I have had positive feedback from
China that Glosa's syntax is similar to that of Chinese, and believe that
the idea of a "concept language" (like Chinese) first floated by Hogben,
and continued by Clark and Ashby, must be interpreted imaginatively.
    To finish on a note closer to home, I would map from English to Glosa
via French.
    In English, we say, rather sloppily, "The water is cold."  Everyone
knows what we mean, but we have to invent a lot of new rules of grammar to
make this (slang?) usage of "is" acceptable within our text-book
understanding of grammar.  A glos of the French version gives us %the water
has cold%, and Glosa reads " U hidra habe frigo."  "frigo" here is a
modifier of "hydra", and yet you are going to have trouble pinning a P-o-S
on it: maybe, as I suggested above, we are ^sculpting^ with semantics.
   Glosa:  U hidra habe frigo.
    glos  the water has cold(ness)

   I really must ask a Chinaman how the Chinese version of this sentence
glosses into English.

Saluta,
 Robin

The Romans were indeed concrete-thinking and direct-acting.
Whereas, "the Greeks have a word for it".

I agree the words should end in vowels, but the vowel
should not be significant, and no 2 words differing
in only the final vowel should be added.

But for criteria, one simply needs to compare how many
of the "basic" lists have a given concept, e.g.,
is it in Ogden's Basic English, is it in the
Essential World English list, Longmans's Defining
dictionary, top 10000 words in the Oxford corpus, etc.
Rick Harrison has a good list of lists.

It turns out there is a linguistic rule, Zipf's Law.
The #1000 most commonly used word in any language
will be 1000 times less frequent than #1. Hmm ...
my calculation shows that the top 10000 words in
English only cover 87.4% of the vocabulary; but
that includes inflected forms, so a more realistic
count would be maybe 3000 roots for 90% coverage.

I think we have a bit of a problem:
the Glosa 6000 is both too small for a full
vocabulary, and too large for a basic one.

Perl is a scripting language, a superset of Bourne shell, awk, grep,
sort, ed, and C. They call it the Swiss-army chainsaw of programming
languages. It is very easy to read in a file or two, sort and match,
then output statistics along with the data. Instant gratification.

It can work. Esperanto uses agglutinative word-building to get by
with less than 3000 words, so Glosa could too. Which would be
easier, though? Glosa syntax is far easier to learn. It must be
admitted that Zamenhof put more and better effort into lexicon,
but Glosa's development isn't finished yet ...

    My old hobby horse: if the only language we have in common is Glosa
but you have learned the Greek-derived word while I have learned the
Latin-derived one, we still cannot communicate!  Pick one of them and
scrap the other!

    I'm not sure I even understand what this "broader level" means.

    Say what?  The Romans did philosophy and the Greeks wrote law. 
There may be a little stereotyping here, and in any case, I really
don't know how this is relevant to an auxiliary language.  It strikes
me as rubbish.  Just consider English.  We have mountains of
etymologically compound words, sometimes from Latin and sometimes 
from Greek, and in the case of "television" a bastard of both!

> *   Actually, I was hoping we could define the criteria for including

    Apart from this roots issue, this matter of a so-called starter
dictionary seems to be something of an unresolvable issue between Robin
and me.

    Not just Asians.  There are a lot of people who have trouble with
Slavic and Germanic consonant clusters and terminal consonants.  It
certainly needn't be a "sop" to consider them.

    My problem is with the inconsistency as to what the non-significant
terminal vowel should be.

    It should not be a problem at all: such words should not exist at
all, in my opinion.  Clean up the dictionary.  Pick a single form and
go with it.

    But if they differ by the terminal vowel at all, then they do not
have identical spelling (or pronunciation).

I am a newcomer to Glosa, but I fell for Interglossa years ago.  Thus, on
the vocabulary issue, I think Hogben's original principle should still
hold.  The roots should be those used internationally in science and
technology, regardless of whether they are Latin, Greek, or Arabic. (The
three sources for most of our technical vocabulary.)  His aim was to make
most of the vocabulary instantly familiar to educated people.  (Of course,
there are not many of those left.  The barbarians are taking over.)  The
technical vocabulary is the same in most European languages, but I am not
sure to what extent these roots are used in the technical vocabularies of
non-European languages.  Certainly the Chinese are inclined to use their
won technical terms, though many are also familiar with the English
technical vocabulary. The Japanese are less so inclined, and also more
inclined to learn the English technical vocabulary as well.  I am not sure
about the Arabs. 

 The principle of basing the vocabulary on international technical terms
opens up possibilites of including terms derived from aviation, computing,
and entertainment.


On the question of a gender neutral pronoun, the Chinese have used a
single pronoun for he/she/it for thousands of years, and it seems to have
worked.  I believe the Turks have a similar arrangement, again with no
major difficulties.

    I have never had the chance to study "Interglossa" in depth.  The
only copy I know of available to me is in the Library of Congress,
whence I may not check it out.  John Schilke was once making noises
about trying to put in on the world wide web, but I don't know the
status of that.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that it came out when it 
did and never got a good trial.  I wish I had a copy of the book but 
cannot currently afford a used book search.

    To the extent that I have been able to be familiar with it at all,
I have tended to think that Interglossa was better than Glosa.  Hogben
did a fairly good job of justification (again, to the best of my
limited familiarity).  His verb system was ingenious and I think needed
only one addition to cover so-called mental/spiritual activity (unless
I am not satisfactorily interpreting what is already there).  Otherwise
the language generally might only need a little sprucing up for 
vocabulary.

    One thing I have observed about Glosa is that the authors (Clark &
Ashby) seemed to have "pulled" it to make it more like recoded English. 
In and of itself this is not bad, as long as everyone understands that,
but if it is more like recoded English, then why should not someone
just expend the additional effort and learn "the real thing"?

    I do think we need to be somewhat careful here.  At least among
the native English-speaking, even "educated" people might use many
words containing Greco-Latin roots as lexical wholes without being
fully familiar with those roots as lexical atoms.  Nevertheless,
vocabulary for an international language has to come from somewhere,
even if it is more or less ad hoc, like Russell's Suma, and I think
Hogben's proposal is about as good as any, especially if there is not
the root mutilation to the extend that there is in Glosa.

    As I see it, an IAL needs a base vocabulary and a principle or
principles for incorporating proper nouns/adjectives and specialist
vocabulary.

    To the best of my limited knowledge, there are various languages
with sex-neutral pronouns.  They seem to get along well.  The Glosa
(and Interglossa?) 'pe' could serve.

    My time and mental energy are somewhat limited these days, but I
might almost be willing to give Interglossa a try if I had access to it.

In some ways, I agree. I want the light part-of-speech marking;
it is minimal and helpful, and sounds much better than Glosa.

But the worst parts of English, idiom and spelling,
are fixed. Hogben's was not a complete, speakable lang.
I'd like to see the two versions brought back together.
The dictionary still needs some work, I think we agree.

Language doesn't stop evolving. I went through the Interlingua
dictionary last night and it was obvious that 25% of the words
have become obsolete since 1954 (approx. when it and I were born).

One can now forget about "educated people"; Rome is burnt.
A vocab should have sturdy roots, and but few, for rapid learning
and universal applicability. It might be better to make them
wholly arbitrary ala Lojban. But they (basic 3000 words) must be
intelligently and scientifically selected or designed.

Starting from the Roget's 1000 is a good first guess,
but better information is available today. The Oxford
corpus of spoken English, WordNet analysis of European langs,
and other more recent efforts must take precedence over Roget!

Anyway, I see Glosa as the only standard-bearer for analytic
languages, which all evidence indicates to be the most
easily learnable type. As it appears to be still somewhat
unfinished, there may be hope for its future.

All just IMO.

Greetings to all, especially Paul and Robin Harwood!
	I am copying this because it summarizes my opinions fairly well 
and I want to be sure to answer a couple of points.

	I did indeed make the effort, either to put it onto the web or to 
try to figure out how to make it available.  I have a copy of the (1943) 
_Interglossa_ by Hogben, and I, too, was much taken with it.  I still 
think it has great potential, even in its original form (with additional 
vocabulary to cover items unknown in the '40's, of course).
	The problem is how to do so.  I am reluctant to mail it anywhere 
because of its tattered condition (wartime paper was highly acidified, it 
seems).  Also, much clever use is made of coloring in its really good 
layout.  Does anyone know whether there are techniques for scanning small 
books?  This is an area of which I have no knowledge and would appreciate 
some advice.  I do have permission from Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby to copy 
it; they hold the copyright.  It is a 16mo aging Penguin paperback.  My 
offer to try to publish it still stands.  I think it would be worth the 
effort.  Please help!

    Glosa seems to be the only one with any activity at all, although
it has not been the only one.  Thai's FRATER (from which I worked on 
my unfinished project frater2) and Russell's Suma were more or less
analytic languages.  One person in Australia even reimbursed me to copy
the third edition of Suma for him.

    I agree that Glosa could use some finishing.  However, the major
problem, as I see it, is how to promote -any- newly minted or otherwise
not widespread IAL.  Glosa has such a minuscule "following" that for
practical purposes it might almost be starting from scratch.  And
eventually it is going to have to be dispersed in far more languages
than just English.  In my essay on "Thoughts on IAL Success" I set
forth dispersal and enthusiasm as probably the most important --
although certainly not the only -- factors as to why any conIAL project
goes anywhere.

I have got a couple of copies of Interglossa, but they are in a box on the
other side of the Atlantic.
Back when I could afford such things, I put a small ad in the Guardian,
and two people sent me their old copies.   This was in 1982, but there may
still be a few copies floating around England.

   It looks as if I will have to let Ron and Wendy know that we have
adopted "pe" as the FIRST PERSON, SINGULAR, NEUTRAL PRONOUN.  Or is it that
I must ask them can we use "pe" as such a new pronoun?  I still have
trouble with protocol.

    I thought that 'pe' was a THIRD person pronoun, not a first.  If
it has been discussed as a first, then I missed the discussion.

    This has disturbed me for a long time, as I have mentioned many
times before.  If Glosa is the private property of Ron Clark & Wendy
Ashby and they exercise complete control over it, then Glosa is in
trouble.  Schleyer tried to do this with Volapük, and his actions 
were a contributing factor to the collapse of the Volapük movement.

*   Robin, welcome.  Yes I agree that the Science/Classical scholar pattern
is sound, and does offer the widest global circulation.  While some
linguo-cultural groups have developed their science before European
civilisation, and others have developed their technical lexicons in
ignorance of the Greek-Latin standardisation, it seems fairly clear that a
European dominance of science on the global scale, is a fait accomple.

*   On this score, I have met Persians and Chinese who, because of their
national languages, have trouble with our male/female distinctions in
English pronouns.
    Glosa followed the English pattern - and I assume Interglossa did the
same.
    However, my suggestion was to find an extra pronoun for the "unknown"
sex, rather than scrap the male and female pronouns as they applied in the
Second Person Singular.

    I ought to attempt a table of how things are in this area, and I only
realised - as a result of this question - that the sex differentiation does
only occur in the Third Person Singular!

 ........... Singular .......................... Plural ...............

 1st ...  mi [I,me,my,mine] ............... na [we,our,us,ours]
 .......  uno-pe [one,oneself] ............ plu-pe [people(ourselves)]

 2nd ...  tu [thou,thee,thine,you,your] ... vi [you,your,yours] 

 3rd ...  fe [she,her,hers] ............./

 .......  pe [it,they,them,he/she] ..... \

Please try these out in your Glosa writing.

    Is it that language designers love complexity, or is it because

Hello John, 
  I recently went for my second Stress Test two months after the angiolasty
and insertion of a stent: this time I was not forced to stop; I hope that I
passed the 'test'.  Will find out when they see me on Monday with the
results of the gamma photography.

On reprinting of historical books, the NSW State Library photographs them
and prints the pages as 'pictures.'  If you get it scanned they will
probably guillotine the spine off the book.

   Maybe I have been uncritical, but I did assume that the Glosa author's
decisions to rebuild the language from scratch .. on fundamentally the same
principles as Hogben .. was well considered.  I liked the -a/-o
inflectional system that Clarke and Ashby had derived from Hogben's less
clear way of using vowels as function markers, but was convinced by them
that, with correct syntax, function markers became a redundant complication.

that Paul will not find Hogben's system as workable as he thinks it ought
to be.  My copy was sent to me by a Conlanger who had two copies: it is
also falling to pieces.

camera, taking a double-page spread to be equivalent to an A4 page.
Snapshots of it this way would cost little beyond the cost of the
electronic camera.  You would need a good word processor or DTP system and
good colour printer to let you print the pages as 'snapshots.'
    S'prise, s'prise: I did not know that Hogben had passed his copyright
over to Ron Clark.

    I thought that for people to uccupy positions of authority and
responsibility, they still needed a reasonable level of education.  I
suspect that you are saying the traditional style of scholar is dying out.
If we are to pitch our communication revolution at the rung of the Lowest
Common Denominator, then I think something is wrong .. or will go wrong ..
with our civilisation.

*   If these superior word lists are available in electronic format, I am
prepared to look at them from scratch, and reform, by selection and
elimination,
a Net vocabulary for Glosa.  To do this I would retain the standardised
spellings derived from Glosa 6000, and would use the modern analyses as a
guide to the best words/concepts for a starter Auxiliary Language.
    Two practical hurdles that make this work seem difficult are problems
with the typing up of dictionaries - one of the factors that contributed to
Glosa's long gestation - and the wide distribution of existing Glosa
dictionaries and word-lists.  While in an ideal world, we would all work
together to compile the agreed most suitable dictionary .. and upgrades
would be funded by the planet's citicens, as Paul pointed out, we are here
in an outpost of harsh reality.
    Now that I have a Pentium 2 with Epson Colour 440 attached, I can think
about DTPing an electronic dictionary so that it can be sent to the Third
World.
What this means is that I am looking both ways: a Public Domain Net
dictionary will be usable throughout the affluent world, and will enhance
the dispersion of Glosa in the 'North'; while an easily-printed paper
version of the same will ensure that Glosa-pe of the 'South' can
communicate ^across the equator^ without any vocabulary miss-matches.
    And here is the "but."  But, if a 'superior' scientifically derived
*glos*a
dictionary varies considerably form the dictionaries that have been in
circulation over the past decade - in spelling or word selection, or both -
then we are liable to compromise the existing user base.  
    If, as well as drastically revising the lexicon, we start to
re-introduce the use of a minimal inflectional system - mainly to indicate
a word's functioning as this, or that, part of speech - then we will
introduce a confusion where one did not exist, before.  Such an act would,
I believe, set back both the cause of World Language Reform and the
language Glosa.  And, while Paul suggest that the welfare of the Glosa
authors should not be a factor in the equation, such an action, if not
handled with tact and diplomacy, would be hard on them, also.
    Here my vote can be recorded as one for consolidating the gains made,
to date, and in favour of bringing efficiency to the push for the
development of Glosa, in its present form.  While the present product may
not be optimised, it can be efficientised and implemented without another
decade of R&D.  In terms of personal effort, I believe that release of a
Net Dictionary in both electronic and paper forms, the release of cassettes
of spoken Glosa, publication of examplar sentences demonstrating Glosa
grammar, and the eventual publication of a Glosa Grammar Book, are my top
priorities.

*   Agreed, Interglossa was an "essay" in that it was a well-thought out
idea presented to the world.  Hogben had not spent time working on the
finer points of usage, and although I don't know for fact, I suspect that
he did not beta test his language.
    'Bringing the two languages together' sounds like a tall order to me,
in that the Glosa authors started with Interglossa as their departure
point.  I suspect that they would think they "had been there, done that"
when it comes to Interglossa's mechanics.
    While I would like to see examples, also, of ways in which the original
Interglossa could be 'brought together' with Glosa, I would suggest that
pragmatically Glosa has a team disseminationg it, while Interglossa does
not.  From the perspective of a field marshal surveying the Language Reform
"battleground," I would see attempts to move Glosa back towards Interglossa
as a splitting of our forces, and a sure path to defeat.

proof-reading.  Also, a word-translation dictionary is often misleading in
that there are many cases where there is no direct Glosa translation of
English language words.  
    But more important is the question of a system for the addition of
technical glossaries and for the importing of proper nouns from other

*   This has been discussed much on this list, and it seems that work needs
to be done to achieve the standardised 'base vocabulary.' This was
commenced a couple of years ago when I had the Glosa 6000 dictionary scanned.
    I am working hard now to complete my attempt to fill in the gaps that
were found by Bill Patterson, when he produced a list of English language
words omitted from Glosa 6000.
    Paul Bartlett also strongly suggested that qualifying adjectives be
included for many of the translations of Glosa words to clarify their
meanings.  Electronically this causes no problem, but, in the printed
dictionary, extra words often translate into extra pages, and increased
costs.  Presently there is no actual money for recasting the printed
dictionaries, and there is limited manpower for the refining of electronic
dictionaries.
   The question of subject matter glossaries seems to me to depend on the
activities of dedicated subject-matter experts putting together word-lists
in their areas of expertise.

As I see it, consolidation will only get done when we work on it.

All of the 2-letter classifier/generics,

I'd like even more of them.

The basic verbs of Interglossa end in a distinctive vowel,
so that tense particles are less tempting to use
for indicating the start of a verb-phrase/predicate.
Glosa's terminal vowels carry no information.
A&C should recant on this! (Not holding my breath.)

The other thing (besides light POS marking) I wish they'd
reconsider, is to use Greek to build scientific words.
Just 2 easy fixes, actually ...

At this point in time, I agree. If a sufficient users base
grows, then these marvelous proposals can be reconsidered.
At that point, A&C could no longer dominate the language.

A word-building system would solve that problem and beyond.
Hand-picking words is OK for the Glosa-6000, but not for
the full 25,000+ vocabulary. A system would also be mnemonic.
That was inherent in the original idea, though obviously
it was not fully developed. Chemists/engineers/etc won't
use it unless it is easy to coin new words systematically;
they will just use random "international" words.

But true in Interlingua. Now there is a new dictionary ...
But well-designed vocabulary will not drift so much.

Indeed, has already; the machines will need to learn

Wow! ... Right now I'm looking at the EuroWordNet pages,
where they have created an "ontology" (categorization)
of common top-level concepts from several languages.

http://www.let.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/topont.htm

In their lists I see several words not present in
the Lojban basic vocabulary, or Glosa's, or even
Essential World English. This is the benefit of a
systematic analysis. Still, their biggest list
has only 1024 items. So I do think it possible
to fill in ALL essential concepts within a
very small vocabulary, such as you propose.
It is NOT easy work to do so, of course.

The word list from the Oxford Corpus is analyzed
into part-of-speech use. See:

Yes, necessarily. One temptation would be to use
dreaded terminal vowels to disambiguate words;
my guess is that someday people will want to use
them for POS marking, despite A&C's intuition.
So please resist that temptation if it bites.

Agreed, 100%.

Indoeuropean languages are difficult in phonology and grammar.
But they have such a large population (over 50% of the world)
and so resemble each other that the IAL designers naturally
produce cleaned-up IE-clones. Easterners have such simple
languages (in phonology and grammar, NOT the writing!)
they see no need for IALs at all (exaggeration).

Though pidgin/creoles have been a great interest of mine,
there is relatively little information about them even today.
Analytic languages are in that domain; most easy to learn,
and they arise for similar reasons. Yet they are stable
(Chinese, English to a lesser extent) and powerful.

It is difficult to make something but keep it simple.
The ideal language would be of this nature.
Glosa has a chance to become such.

Hogben doesn't count? A&C tried a variation of
it, that doesn't count? Several people have
stated a preference for the old Interglossa
over Glosa, why count them?

The terminal vowels are not meaningless by
accident; either they decided to keep that option
open, or tried overloading and found it didn't work.

An alternative is to use articles and tense
particles to mark phrase boundaries. So far,
that seems to be the direction it's going.
In fact, that is the usual way with pidgins.

I just like Hogben's way a little better.
Since 99% of the good press Glosa has
gotten is due to Hogben/Bodmer, I'd be
careful not to jettison their work entirely.

    That is possible.  I have not had the opportunity to become as

    Possible.  I do not know all the history of their efforts. 
However, I did know of one IAL project in which the author was going to
have a grand total of nine (count 'em) verbs in the entire language. 
So the idea of a strictly limited set of verbs is not unique to
Interglossa.  I have never had the chance to give it a try myself.

    This is a design decision, not something Writ Large in the Nature
of the Cosmos.  As I recall, Hogben made a deliberate, conscious
design decision to retain etymological spelling in place of strict
phoneticity.  For that matter, the compilers of the Interlingua-English
Dictionary did something rather similar (although in the Gode&Blair
Interlingua Grammar there is provision for a "collateral orthography,"
which has not particularly caught on, at least on the Interlingua
mailing list).

    They simply made a different decision from Hogben and the compilers
of the IED.  In written form, at least, I personally would find Glosa
easier to read with the etymological spelling.  A few more rules could
cover the case of written-for-to-pronunciation, although I acknowledge
that the inverse would be a little more difficult.  However, with a
vocabulary of limited size, it would be less of a burden that the mess
with English.

    'Pe', which already exists, seems to do quite well.

    This would seem to me to mean that you are saying that we have no
choice but to maintain the staus quo.  Cleaning up the terminal vowel
confusion will -necessarily- mean conflict with some of the published
wordlists.  And without cleanup, I myself don't even think Glosa is
worth paying much attention to (as well as the Greek-Latin synonym
redundancies).  Similarly with optimization of the vocabulary.  I see
no way around a possible "compromise [of] the existing user base" to
at least a minimal extent if Glosa is to mature.  Unfortunate, and I
will entertain arguments to the contrary, but I suspect that some such
conflict is almost inevitable, simply because in my estimation Glosa
was "put out there" without sufficient consistency.

    Not everyone advocates "a minimal inflectional system" or part-of-
speech marking.  I for one don't.

    I agree that another decade of research and development is not
necessary.  At the risk of repeating myself, I see the need only for
the following:

1) Eliminate the terminal confusion.

2) Eliminate the Greek-Latin word pairs (in each instance, pick 
   one and discard the other).

3) Optimize the base vocabulary (and I do -not- consider Glosa 6000
   to be the "base vocabulary").

4) Enhance the "Mechanics of Glosa" with connected to text to
   demonstrate that it is simply not necessary to mark everything 
   under the sun.

5) Promote the language better (however that is to be done).

    In some cases, as previously noted, some Glosa words differ 
only by their terminal vowels.  I see no problem with this so long 
as individual words with different terminal vowels in different
publications get cleaned up.  I myself just do not see a big toot 
for overloading terminal vowels other than to be part of distinct 
words.

    Charles, to be honest, I am not aware of anyone other than yourself
stumping for part-of-speech marking in Glosa.  I guess it comes down 
tp different design features wanted in an auxlang.  Some want
characteristics like word-terminal POS marking, and some don't.

    I think that the situation may be a little of both.  Its promotion
has been relatively weak and limited, in my estimation.  On the other
hand, I simply do not consider Glosa a sufficiently mature product for
me to want to put very much energy into actually using it.

    Please note that all I said was "in Glosa."  Certainly there are
many people dealing with this, that, or the other auxlang who want
and/or like part-of-speech marking in some form or other.  But I was
resferring specifically and only to Glosa when I remarked that you
yourself are the only person I am currently aware who seems to be
advocating such specifically for Glosa.

*   Sorry to repeat my previous comments:-
 . No, the Glosa authors know they cannot copyright a language.
 . They have placed GEO copyright on their dictionaries, wordlists and
other publications.
 . Clark and Ashby have attempted to exert a 'moral right' over Glosa, in
that they have conducted considerable field research in developing the
language, and thus have released it, ultimately, as a fait accomple.
 . The authors did say that people should "play with the language", and I
believe that this condition still applies.  While the foundations of the
language are solidified by now, and though the authors do not expecr to see
serious attempts to change the basic criteria of Glosa, there is much room
for personal interpretation of the usage of the language. 
 . The authors believe the language to be in its late "beta testing" stage ..
if not a "gamma testing" one.  Thus, they do not imagine a return to the
drawing board for Glosa, at this stage of its development.
 . There are a number of changes yet needed in Glosa, some already
mentioned by 
Paul - though they are additional to the basic structure of Glosa,
extending it, rather than fundamentally changing it ...
   # creation of technical glossaries;
   # formulation of guidelines for tha addition of new terms and proper nouns;
   # clarification of the rules of sentence formation;
   # guidelines on the use of idiom and metaphor within Glosa.

    However, the Glosa authors exert a co-ordianating influence over the
process of dissemination of the language, quite apart from its design
elements.
    In general, there is room for a wider administration of Glosa's 
dissemination, and this is gradually evolving as its usage becomes
decentralised.  But yes, I have noted some reluctance on the part of the
authors to delegate authority in administration work.  For my part, I
maintain contact with people in Third World countries, and we use Glosa for
our communication.  There is hardly any discussion at this level about
language design, most of the comments being about the method of dissemination.
    I work with the authors, and am not acting as an independent Glosa-pe.
I could describe the relationship as one of "concensus".  As a 'research
assistant' I make suggestions to the authors, and conduct research in areas
that have not been covered by their work; when my suggestions do not yield
countering advice, I go ahead and implement them.

    Perhaps the cut and thrust rules of academic research are inapplicable
in the realms of Independent Scholarship.  When researchers are unpaid,
then the relationships between senior researchers and assistant researchers
are more sensetive to disharmony, with nothing to keep the group together,
beyond mutual support.

    Without making further declarations on the inter-relationships within
the Glosa research community, I would appeal to Glosa supporters , Glosa
enquirers and would-be Glosa-pe to tru the language for themselves.  Give
the language a trial, in its present, state before seeking changes - even
for the best of intellectual reasons.  It is mu present understanding that
Language Knowlege resides in the subconscious and other regions of the
brain, and not primarily in the 'consciousness centres'.  
    For this reason I would encourage enquirers on this list thus:-
 . learn by doing;
 . aim to 'think in Glosa';
 . test the language by using it to write about something you know ...
which is not too technical;
 . open-mindedly explore the idea of a language whose words primarily
represent concepts.
 . look for beauty and elegance in Glosa, and attempt to discover a 'feel'
for these qualities by using Glosa.

Saluta,
 Robin G.

Choose one (the Latin one if there's no better reason) for standalone use.  But

Good mechanics is essential!!!  Can we have a *definitive* list of phrase

Promote it within the conlang circle yes, but I fear it's too young to venture

    By the "Mechanics of Glosa" I am referring to the lists of
paradigmatic phrases and sentences that appear in various publications,
as well as in the web pages I set up.  My only real complaint with
these lists of paradigms is that they are insufficient.

    A young child does not learn her native tongue from a grammar book. 
However, neither does she learn paradigmatic phrases free from a
context.  That context is feedback, both verbal and nonverbal, from her
elders.  Such feedback is missing in the current "Mechanics of Glosa"
approach.

    For instance, with nothing but isolated paradigmatic sentences, a
would-be learner of Glosa might get the idea that it is necessary to
mark tense (or aspect) on every verb, when it is no such thing.  If the
time referent is clearly in the past or the future, then it is simply
not necessary to keep using 'pa' and 'fu' all over the place.  Some
natlangs (such as English) are forever marking tense, but there is no
reason Glosa has to.  Similarly, it is simply not necessary to mark
every noun with 'u(n)' and 'plu' every time, such as after a
preposition, especially when number is unknown or irrelevant.

    An enhanced "Mechanics of Glosa" would bring these matters out in a
way that the isolated paradigmatic phrases and sentences do not.  Just
provide some connected text to make such things clear.

     By the way, information on AllNoun can be found at

    The protocols of dealing with "Glosa Central."  They do not
participate in online fora, and nobody seems to know -- at least, I
don't -- what their attitude to such online activity is and whether
they would try to pull a Schleyer.

    But would they try to claim copyright infringement if others
published wordlists and examples?  I still think that the best thing
Zamenhof ever did for Esperanto was to place in unequivocally in the
public domain.  He never got rich off of it.

    Zamenhof during his lifetime seemed to have remained -the- examplar
of good Esperanto usage but otherwise did not control it.  History
seems to show that attempting to exert proprietary control over an
auxlang is deadly.

    Clark & Ashby are to be commended for their work.  However, if it
is to be considered a fait accompli and not subject to further
optimization, then I think it is in trouble.

    To some extent, I think that sort of thing is what is going on
here.

    I do not think the basic structure of the language needs to be
changed.  I just think some things need some cleaning up, which I will
not tiresomely repeat here.

    As I say, I don't think it needs it.

>    # guidelines on the use of idiom and metaphor within Glosa.

    I have stated elsewhere (primarily on AUXLANG) that idiom should be
scrupulously AVOIDED at almost all costs in an auxlang.  Idioms are the
bane of learners and non-native users of languages.  Metaphor is a
different matter, although even that should be used with care.

    If everything is dependent on Richmond, things are not good.

    Such reluctance may be understandable, but I think it is unwise.

    This is legitimate advice as far as it goes.

    Quite some time ago I took the Glosa Basic Reference from my web
pages and "cut it down to size" by deleting the Glosa-English portion
and reformatting it somewhat for personal use.  This evening, with some
judicious editing, I processed that in turn.  What I came up with was a
list of approximately 155 word pairs (or a triple or two), some for the
same thing and some instances of the same term differing only by the
terminal vowel.  I advocate that in each instance, one term be accepted
and the other(s) dropped.  I append the list for information.  Note
that this list does -not- cover all the possibilities of couplets and
triplets in Glosa 6000.  Because of the manual editing process, it is
possible that I missed something here and there.

*   The last time something was knocked into shape by "mass action" was the
refining of the _Tense Table_.  This was done, off-line, by different
people looking at the copy of the Tense Table they recieved, and rewriting
it and adding to it, so that the final form was a melding of many inputs,
with the resultant 'stabalised' form of the Table being the version that
people were happy with after it had been through many hands.
    Maybe the Net is supposed to work like this, too.  But, so far, the
Glosalist hasn't worked as a ^hands on^ experimental work-place in the same
sort of way.  Bottle-necks occur, and this slows down the innovation
process: up to now, I have been the main bottle-neck, because I am the one
who went through the dictionary - word for word - in an attempt to
stabalise it.  The only other substantial effort since then has been Bill
Patterson's compiling of a list of English-language words for which he
could find no Glosa equivalents.
    It took me a long while going through this list trying to find
equivalent words from the existing Glosa dictionaries or the Latin
dictionary, or by creating compound words or phrases that would act as
equivalents.  After I type this up, and it will be a long list added as an
"Attachment", I will ask for feedback from the members of this List.  I
will also send a copy to the authors.
    As soon as I mail off the list of "missing words" I will start
seriously on the job of chopping down the "6000" to at least half of its
size: this will be approached on an *every second word must go* sort of basis.
    I am not saying that others should not attempt the same, just that
others are not.  Hence, I need to work a bit harder to give you a shorter
dictionary to look at, think about and ammend.  One possible "missing word"
for example, is 
 JOB.  Do we lump it in with WORK, or do we divide 'work' up into smaller
pieces called 'jobs'?  What is the Glosa equivalent of the English-language
word, "job": is it ~ergo~, ~opus~, ~job~ or can it be any of these?

>>   Can we have a *definitive* list of phrase

>
*   Well, the authors settled on the semi-colon for dividing clauses in
text, because they thought that, with syntax being the main factor in
grammar, they would need to indicate clause boundaries very clearly.  The
semi-colon was elevated to the status of a "syntax marker."
    If you don't like the semi-colon, put forward your own suggestion with
examples of Glosa text demonstrating it.  As I see it, text is the main
problem in communicating meaning: there is no emotion, intonation, emphasis
or pausing.
So, it is my belief that written communication needs a hell of a lot more
help, in trying to get the message through, than does spoken communication.
    Looking at relative values, I think that putting a distinctive,
non-verbal syntax marker in written text is more important than the fact
that such an indication cannot be heard in speech.
    As I recall, the Glosa authors were quite happy with the comma for
normal phrase marking, where it seems either necessary or helpful.  When I
write parallel texts in Glosa and English, I look at the two sentences, and
evaluate them separately: I read the English-language sentence, and decide
whether or not the phrases need marking off with a comma; and then, I read
the Glosa sentence, independently of the first, sensing whether commas are,
or are not, needed in it.  There does not seem to be a direct 'mapping
across' of the punctuation marks from one language to the other: each seems
to imply its own rules of 'punctuation'.

*   Yes, a complete book of _Glosa Grammar - By Example_ would be a great
thing.  You are all invited to send in your own examples; there is no
guarantee that they will be among the finally-accepted examples adopted by
the group; nor will your intellectual property be rewarded.  Such a
'group-think' product would bear the GEO (Glosa Education Organisation)
copyright mark, which means that the Glosa charity would own the results of
our collective participation.
    I put a case here for "altruism": 'think not what your world can do for
you, but what you can do for your world'.  The above suggestion is one of
organised anarchism: while no-one is "boss", neither are we losing our
authority, nor are we losing to someone else's advantage.  The authors did
not create the mechanics examples with word functions indicated: I did.
So, I can be free to give away this idea for the greater good.  While, for
those who would be worried about having their intellectual productions
stolen by others who would profit from them, placing the G.E.O. copyright
on the final book (GG-BE), would protect our collective efforts from

*   Why on earth, did I attempt to retell in Glosa children's stories, like
the "Three Bears" legend?  The grammar inherent in this story is absorbed
by osmosis: it is a story that tells itself; most of us know what is coming
next.  This is the sort of "context" you ask for.  The sentences of the
childrens stories are the examples of the 'mechanics' of the language,
while the stories give the context.
    I didn't say that writing these stories was easy, just that I worked
hard to make the final products easy to read.
    When are you going to try your hand at Glosa, by retelling your
favourite(s) in Glosa?

*   This truth is the main contribution, so far, from Paul Bartlett to the
refining of Glosa.  Paul states the case very clearly, and leaves it to the
sense of the writer/speaker to decide whether context does, or does not,
indicate the need for particles.
    Formerly, I had thought that all Glosa documents had to be 'machine
readable' for the purpose of Machine Translation.  But no: Glosa, like all
languages operates at different levels, and Paul pointed out that it was
'wrong' to demand the repetition of tense markers and determinants, where
they were essentially redundant.
    When, on the other hand, it might become necessry to run Glosa
documents through the Translating Machine, we could see the possibility of
^topping and tailing^ Glosa texts, prior to running them through the
translator, by adding the 'missing particles', for the benefit of
translation.  
    So, I still see the "verbose", full form of Glosa with the redundant
particles in place, and the "vernacular" form with the otherwise redundant
particles 'elided.'  I suspect that Paul would not see things this way:
even so, when we write conversational Glosa, both of our versions of the
language come out looking much the same.

6000 words, but we havent caught them all yet.  Yes, the most suitable

the selection of basic words.  We have agreed that a first dictionary with

in "6000", I found, in practice, that the "6000" was a lot more comfortable

    Paul suggests work in languages other than English.  I must ask about
this: there are Glosa-pe in most European countries, and Glosa-X
dictionaries do exist for most Euro-languages.
    Yes, there is some prejudice, but the main opposition is apathy towards
the concept of Language Reform.

Yep, I'm still around. But I've been awfully busy the last month or so
and am currently getting over a nasty cold. Can't wait to add the missing
words to the dictionary!

If we could just get rid of all the synonyms we could cut the size down
a great deal. I know there's still a bunch lurking in there that I missed.
I'm certain that I found most of the ones that were defined using the same
English word(s), but I know that some remain because they were defined by
English synonyms that I didn't catch. That is, if glosa1 and glosa2 were
defined as english1, I found them. More difficult to find are cases in
which glosa1=english1 and glosa2=english2, and english1 and english2 are
synonyms themselves!

I tried once to categorize the whole bunch,
similar to the way Paul has them on his web page.
Arranging them in classes would show more clearly
the comparative overload of terms in certain areas.
I know of a few efforts to arrange a hierarchy
of terms (Rick Harrison, WordNet, some AI stuff)
but nothing complete for this purpose. When making
such a subdivision of semantic space, one is
forced to confront one's metaphysical biases
or else simply inherit them from someone else.

It really doesn't take much money to do so.
They just don't think the net is important enough.
I mean, even my cats have their own domain!

And so, it must be stated that these selections follow no mechanical or
statistical rationale: they follow the subjective sensation of mouth and
ear (mine); for each synonym group, I chose the alternative that sounds
best in use, and feels better in the mouth, when spoken.

    With feed-back from the Glosalist group, alterations can be made, and
the final selections will be used to adjust the existing word-lists, that
are in electronic form.

    Because this 'Bartlett List of Synonyms' is in e-mail format and is
shorter than the 'Patterson List of Omissions', I completed it first;
however, the Omissions List is ready to be typed up, and will be sent as an
"Attachment".  Let me know if your system fails to get my "Attachments" and
I will resend the List as a "Redirection."

    After that, some juggling must be done to knock the final, optimised,
standardised, and non-synonym list into a final _Glosa Net
Dictionary_ that everyone is happy with.

    We will have to work fast if we are to meet the 1/1/99 deadline for
completion of what I nickname "Glosa 2.5K".

Saluta,

I must try to put some thought into Glosa grammar, but I'm just so busy at the
moment.  At least the two week Christmas holidays will soon be with me -- 14
days with the inlaws and 14 days without a common language :-(

Subject: Re: Word Pairs and Terminal Vowels
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 15 Dec 98 23:2

    I will not try to address Robin's post point by point, as I think
that is unnecessary.  There are, to me, three major consideration:

1)  As to the Greek/Latin pairs, I think it is enough just to pick one;
I have no strong opinions as to which in most cases.

2)  Some things Robin brought out may just be disambiguation, such as
a(d)/topo, making clearer which is what.  (The Glosa documents do not
always make such things clear.)

    In these two matters it is more or less an issue of clarification
and selection from among existing material.  I am presuming that
Richmond should not have too much trouble with this.  (At least, if I
were in their situation, I would not.)  Perhaps, if there is some
agreement among (actual or potential) 'net users of Glosa, Robin would
be a suitable person to convey the intentions of such usages to G.E.O.

3)  In some instances, however, I think that Robin was trying to make
unnecessary distinctions.  There needs to be some limit to making
distinctions with nouns and verbs.  That's what adjectives and adverbs
are for.  Otherwise, let us abolish all adjectives and adverbs and have
a gazillion nouns and verbs, all of which make the most minute
distinctions within their own instrinsic meanings!

    This is primarily a clarification: 'a(d)' = "to, toward"; 'topo' =
"at (a place)".

> >akusti, audi  ...  akusti [listen to]; audi [hear]

    This I think is an unnecessary distinction.  Even in English it is
fairly subtle, and Glosa need not slavishly follow every subtle
distinction of just one language.  If Glosa is to be a relatively simple
language to learn and use, it should leave subtleties to qualifiers
(adjectives and adverbs).

> >aqa, hidro  .....  hidro [water] ... aqa (reasonable synonym)  +++

    Pick one or the other.  And was it Brother Irvine who suggested a
distinction between water in general and drinkable water?  Leave such a
distinction to an adjective or adjectival phrase.

> >artikula, artro .  artikula  ~~~~~ [joint; good enunciation]

    In this instance I will go with Robin.  I do think that avoidance
of consonant clusters, when the opportunity presents itself, is a
legitimate design goal for the sake of those people whose native speech
habits make consonant clusters difficult for them (unlike the habits of
us Germano-Slavic speakers).

> >bio, vita  ......  bio [life, living]; vita [life energy]

    Nope.  Just use one.  "LIfe energy" sounds too much like the
discredited old notion of "elan vital."  Why not just 'energi de bio'
instead of a separate term?  Again, avoid unnecessary distinctions when
a qualifying word or short phrase will do the trick.  Whenever possible,
lessen the learning and memory burden.

> >destru, nekro  ..  destru [destroy]; nekro [death]

    A reasonable split.

> >fascina, faskina . fascina === spelling difference only

    Yes.  However, this does bring up another matter.  In at least one
G.E.O. publication, there is the pronunciation rule of 'sc' = "sh"
(English), and yet 'sc' is hardly used.  Why 'skience' and not
'science'?

> >feki, kopro .....  feki  ~~~~~ [dung, faeces]

    I myself would recognize 'kopro' better, but that is a problem with
the whole matter of Greek/Latin pairs.  Recognition will depend in part
on a individual's background, and you can't please everybody.

> >frigi-tem, hiberna ... hiberna  ~~~~~ [winter]

    'Frigi-tem' saves an unnecessary word.  I am definitely in favor of
saving a vocable to be learned when a simple compound or phrase will do.
Why add to the learning burden?

> >gene, esce  ....  gene [gets, becomes]; esce [develops into, becomes]

    What is the difference between the two "becomes" in this instance?
As for "gets," maybe things are different in Australian English, but in
American English "get" is a very, very slippery word.  I vehemently
propose that "get" be dropped from ALL discussion in Glosa.  It causes
more trouble than anything else.  It is completely unnecessary and is
so ambiguous as to be a major source of problems of understanding.

    Why not just have 'fito-hema' = "plant-blood" for "sap" and be done
with it?  Again, it would save a word.  Here there are again unnecessary
distinctions which just add to the memory burden.

> >kapsu, kapsa, paketa, teka ... %%%

>      teka*, kapsu [box]; kapsa [parcel]; paketa [packet] (*-preferred)

    No.  Unnecessary distinctions.

> >konka, ostraka .. konka [snail]; ostrako [shell]

  The Greek 'ostrakon' meant primarily "postsherd" and only secondarily
the shell of certain life-forms.

> >lase, lice, permite .. lase [let]; lice [allow]; permite [give perm.]

    Unnecessary distinctions again.

    In the real-world of practical communications, what's the
difference?

> >metodi, mode  ... metodi [method (of doing)]; mode [mode, way]

    Again, what's the difference?  This is unneeded hairsplitting.

> >nuli, zero  ..... nuli [nothing, none, no];  zero [no (countables)]

    Some languages get along with one term.  Why not Glosa and save
effort?

> >pan, panto  .... panto [all]; pan (brief form)
> >pen, penta  .... penta [five (5)]; -pen- [(digit) five] (in compound)

    I think we should keep abbreviated compounding forms to a minimum.
Otherwise we risk winding up like Lojban with its sometimes baffling
combining forms.  I do not see the saving of a single syllable to be
worth the effort of wrestling with two words.  Make them 'okto',
'panto', and 'penta' and have done with it.

> >po, post  ...... posto[in rear,afterwards];post[afterwards];po[after]

   Ambiguous.  Are you trying to differentiate between time and space?

> >poli, multi  ... poli [many, lots of]; multi [many, much]

    Unnecessary.

> >qo numera?,qanto? qo numera[how many(countables)];qanto[h.m. uncount]

    My understanding is that not all languages distinguish between count
and mass.  Why should Glosa at the risk of added complication?

> >qo-mode?, komo? . qo-mode  ~~~~~ [how, which way]

    Abolish 'komo' as superfluous.

> >saluta, ave  ... saluta [greetings]; ave [salutations, respect]

    Is Glosa to be like some languages in which the words used depend on
the relative social status of the individuals?  Simplify, simplify,
simplify!

> >semani, signifi . semani[meaning]; signifi[indication,significance]

    Unnecessary.

> >strata, via  ... via [way, path, road]; strata [paved street]

    Abolish 'strata'.  Use 'solidi via' and save an unneeded term.

> >su, supra  ..... supra ....... su (diminutive & for compounds)

    One more unneeded and burdensome diminutive.

> >termo-tem, estiva . estiva  ~~~~~ [summer]

    'Termo-tem'.  Save four words for the four seasons.

> >tet, tetra  .... tetra [four (4)]; -tet- [four (in compound)]

    'Tetra' only.

> >topika, tema  .. tema [theme]; topika [topic, topical]

    What's the difference in a practical language?  Again, use modifiers
or phrases for subtleties.

> >ze, zero  ..... zero [nought (0)]; -ze [nought (as part of a number)]

    'Zero' or 'nuli'.

    However, this can be a tricky method.  What sounds good to your ear
and feels good to your mouth may not necessarily do so to mine.  Even a
person's native language may influence this heavily.  Unfortunately, so
far as I know, on this forum we do not have other-than-native-English
speakers among us.

    This will be good.  (By the way, there need to be enough terms to
allow discussing Glosa in Glosa.)

    I suggest that this deadline may be a mite to tight.  And I don't
even recall reading of it.  (However, that may be due merely to a faulty
memory.)

Cool. As are most of the choices. Good work, Robin.

Um, that's a terrible consonant cluster, "pt" ...

The general drift of the phonology is vowel-final,
so I would prefer all the consonant-final words changed.
This isn't the greatest example of it, but 'twill serve.

Latinish "-esce" isn't even a real word ...
"gene" is good, though.

Hmm. Glosa does have such pairs of full/abbreviated words,
but I don't like that feature; "kausa" is much better.
Same for "ki". There should be no such over-optimization
for short words in an auxiliary language; over time
some longer (5 letters is long??) might erode naturally,
but initially "kausa"/"kine" is more mnemonic.

That one is beautiful.

Another good one.

Good and necessary distinction.

Maybe March 1st is more realistic for adding the "missing" ones?

Hi Friends: Aaron responded quickly to the work on the Bartlett synonym

suggestions, here, and will encourage the formation of a concensus view:
keep those opinions coming in so that you can contribute to the concensus!

for 6000+, but is the distinction beyond the scope of the 2.5K Project?
    And which "water" serves in the interim: aqa OR hidra?

Subject: Glosa 2.5K?
To: glosalist
Date: Sat, 19 Dec 98 16:5

    I was off Glosalist for some time, so I have probably missed out on
some things.  Robin has referred, at least informally, to a "Glosa
2.5K," which is (or is to be) a list of about two and a half thousand
words/concepts for which there will be Glosa counterparts.  How was
this list constructed?  Apart from the cleanup selection of specific
vocables (terminal vowels, Gree/Latin pairs, and the like), is it the
intention that such a list be the (or a) basic vocabulary, for 'net use
if nothing else?  Has anything been proffered on the issue of dealing
with proper names and specialist vocabulary (e.g., science, law,
medicine, engineering)?

    Once there is some sort of agreed-upon basic vocabulary list, at
least for 'net use, has any thought been given to expanding the
"Mechanics of Glosa" with some samples of connected text?  (I might be
willing to help on this, time and energy allowing.  The "Mechanics"
would also need to be checked for standardized forms.)  Does G.E.O.
know that all this activity is going on?  If so, what is their
reaction?

Sorry Friends,

  I sent this post before completing it.  I continue here at the "***"
mark -

in replying to Aaron's comments.


>***

>>> >artikula, artro .  artikula  ~~~~~ [joint; good enunciation]

>>

>>Maybe artro ~~~~~~ [knuckle] ???

>>

*   After reading Paul's comments about possibly using an adjective for
drinking water, rather than a specific word for "potable water", I think
this principle is the one we should be persuing, for Glosa in general,
and for the 

2.5K list, in particular.  Perhaps using ~artikula~ for articulation,
generally, is in line with the hard-to-define concept language idea.

>>

>>I like sud, but we could avoid a final consonant by chosing austra, and
it

*   I would like a little more rigor in the discussion on ending words 

with vowels.  Although it is a stated Glosa goal, I am not sure if it has
to be an article of faith, or a principle followed in all 
circumstances.

>>

>>Prefer baka, sounds more beautiful for some reason.  Don't like the
final s on kokus.  I admit I'm being subjective here.

reasoning.  Id say ~baka~ is in - for reasons of beauty.

*   ~Feli~ in.


>>> >festa, libe-tem .  libe-tem  ~~~~~ [free time, holiday]

*   At present, I would prefer to concentrate on keeping the lexicon
short, and would rather not make ad hok additions to the lexicon.

*   Very possibly, but I don't think now is the time for it.  My feeling
is that the idea of getting information into a recorded, readable form is
enough for 2.5K.  We can be specific, if necessary, with ~rekorda~ for
sound and video.


>>> >hemi, semi  ....  hemi  ~~~~~ [half]

>>

>>Any use in having half-ish vs mathemtically 0.5 ???

>>

*   Yes.  But, later, after the dust settles, with the 2.5K circling the
globe, electronically, and the 6000+ happily stabilised.  There needs to
be a scheme for the addition of new lexical items, but that would be in
the next half-

thousand.  The authors created an _Advanced 5000 Technical Terms_, but
did not promote it when they found that most people were happy with the
shorter 1000 and 6000 lists.  


>>> >infra, hipo, sub ...  infra [under, below] ....  sub (synonym) +++

>>

*   Agreed.  Feedback from others needed.  My experience is from trying
to use this (these) concept(s) while writing Glosa: my brain separated
movement into two distinct groups;  it also helped when I found KI and
KINE listed one under the other , with slightly different meanings in the
'Glosa 1000 - English' section of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.  However,
I felt that it did NOT actually help towards further concept definition,
when I found, in the larger part of _Glosa 6000_

Kinesi moving

Kineti moving

 

>>> >malus, pomi  .... malus [pear]; pomi [apple]

>>Don't like the -s at all.  Sorry.

*   We can all agree on ~pomi~ but might keep a waiting brief on the
matter of all the rest of the world's eating pleasures .. at least until
a scheme is decided upon for the derivation of the common names of fruits
- possibly from their botanical Genus names.


>>> >mana, matina  ... matina [morning]; -mana (as part of compounds)

>>Is this complexity really needed?

>>

*   Possibly not; ~mana~ could be a quaintly formed dininutive for
compound formation, EG seti-mana [week (seven-morn)].


>>> >pan, panto  .... panto [all]; pan (brief form).

>>One or the other please.

>>

*   ~pan~ it is then.  Maybe ~panto~ can be revived in the Glosa++
edition to provide the emphatic, non-exclusive version of "all".


>>> >po, post  ...... posto[in
rear,afterwards];post[afterwards];po[after]

>>Don't like post.  Sorry.

*   Easy: ~post~ having a terminal consonant, and being one diminutive
too many, is out!


>>> >porta, janu  ... janua  ~~~~~ [door, doorway]

*   Well, in _6000_ it is JANUA [door, entrance], and in the
Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary it is <bold>Door </bold>ianua.

>>> >qo-horo?, qo-di? . qo-horo [when?, what's the time?]; qo-di [w.
day?]

>>> >qo-mode?, komo? . qo-mode  ~~~~~ [how, which way]

>>

>>Either qo or qo-.  Is qanto really needed??

>>

*   Probably right about the hyphen: it should follow a simple rule, and
I feel that it is better included.  The COUNT/UNCOUNT idea is definitely
in Functional 

Grammar, and seems valid unless it is only the British who are so
conscious of the difference between EG, flour (uncount) and bags of flour
(count).

  Qo-numera de spatula tu vo habe mi loka epi u tabla?

 (how-many  of  spoons you wish to have me locate on the table)


  Qanto sukra tu uti te face u mo kilo-gram plaka?

 (how much sugar you use to make a one kilogram cake) 


>>> >rubi-xanto, orange . rubi-xanto  ~~~~~ [orange]

>>I prefer orange.

>>

*   Well, OK.  According to the rules of pronunciation of Glosa, it could
be shown as: orange - (oran-gay), or, in Gaskell phonetics,
OR-r-AH-n'g-AY.

terminal vowels, and what not)?  If we were all playing from

    And pragmatically, per Pound Sterling spent on Third World vs. Internet

can understand their putting their limited resources where their best

*   Good question!  Just imagine a large database, somewhere with
candidates for the "2.5K" down one side, and 'votes' in favour of inclusion
- in columns across.  (The number of columns will depend on the number of
Glosalist participants.)

    We ought to add 'missing' words to the 6000 list first; then, after
we've decided on the 6000+ list, we can 'vote' on the words in it .. on the
basis that every second word, at least, should go.

    Paul Bartlett would much rather have us start from a reasonable Glosa
1000 list and add to it.  While I agree this might even be the better way
to go, I do feel it is worthwhile to see the larger list, so we know what
we are excluding.

    Because the whole 6000+ list will be a very large file, it might be
necessary to split the list into a number of parts.  I suspect that having
two computer screens side by side, and building up a composite list with
preferences-for-inclusion marked, I could produce tables of preferences
(assuming the list is split up) for posting to the Glosalist.

    I'd say we need to make our choices based on the percieved need to use
the words .. in the coming struggle for human survival.

    I disagree, which should be no surprise.  I have previously
expressed my opinion that Glosa 6000 should be used for nothing more
than a source-book to fill in any perceived gaps but otherwise whould
be put on the shelf to gather dust.  And I am still wondering about
the "Glosa 2.5K" Robin has referred to.  If every other word of "6000"
were to go, we would still be substantially above my size estimate for
a basic vocabulary.

    I will give a single example of what I mean.  Suppose some
reasonable group of people came to some sort of more or less amicable
agreement on the terminal-vowels problem and the Greek/Latin pairs
issue.  Then optimize the vocabulary to whatever size it might turn out
to be.  For the "Mechanics of Glosa" add some agreed-upon connected
text to the existing paradigmatic phrases and sentences (themselves
cleaned up, if necessary, for terminal vowels and Greek/Latin).

    That much done, which does not really seem to be so great, then 
on a time-available basis I would cheerfully update the Glosa Basic
Reference I have on the web.  But because it contains originally
copyrighted materials, would Clark&Ashby allow it?

Friends have web hosting (no dialup) at he.net
for approximately $20 per month. So, it is really
just silly NOT to have an official "www.glosa.org".
No need for fancy applets, just a *presence*
and some informative text and points of contact.
Many would contribute articles, sounds, etc.

I don't have strong specific feelings about lexicon.
So I'll designate as my proxy (pause while coin is
tossed -- wow, it balanced on one edge) that fellow
known as "Ailanto" to vote for me.

Well, it's a start. I've always liked Roget. Question:
is there a list of correspondences between Roget numbers
and the Glosa words?

I would take several well-known basic vocabularies and merge them.
The most essential 10000 (or less) would be bi-syllabic.
Then rely on "adjectives" or compounding to build most of the rest,
as Esperanto does successfully from a small core vocabulary (2000?).
Certain specialist multi-syllabic vocabularies could be defined
by experts if needed.

The basics should be compared with Roget (done!), Kanji,
Esperanto/Ido (with extra special attention to their
powerful word-building suffixes) and a few others.

Look here, RH has done most of the work already:

   If I ever stop answering Auxlang mail, I will get down to doing some

*   Thanks for the kind comments, Charles.
Method used:-
  . Decide approx. what I want to say,  
  . Check out all possible Glosa words for expressing the idea,
  . Consider the 'concept' meaning of each of the words, if poss.,
  . Try the sentence with what seems the most suitable of the possible words;
   & see what the sentence looks like,
   & hear what it sounds like,
   & observe what the sentence 'feels' like, kinesthetically, when it is
being enunciated,
   & assess the comfort rating of the tested sentence: accept if satisfactory,
  . Try the sentence with the other poss. words until one word passes the
test.

*   For a word that is frequently "compounded" a final consonant could be
reasonable.  But AUSTRA follows the 'terminal vowel' rule, though it has
both a vowel pair and a consonont triple - making it difficult for some:
 VVCCCV not VCV .

    I feel that such an achievement will be very worthwhile, even if not

    All of the recommendations and agreements will have to be collated in
one place .. probably physically, not virtually.  My suggestion is that the
final form be put into shape on my computer.
    This 2.5K idea is little more than that, at present.  How might it be
administered?
 . Starting with the Greater 6000, I might send a copy of the ammended
list, probably the Glosa->English version, to all on the Glosalist.  Then I
might ask subscribers to go through, either selecting their finalists or
eliminating their non-preferred words.  Posting these voting results back
to the list - or directly to me - a final melt-down could be made.  I
would, of course, democratically want to publish the results of subscribers
selections.
   From this result, a short list of 2000 - 2500 words could be selected,
and republished on the list for a final concensus from subscribers.

    There is no Net dictionary for Glosa in the Public Domain, at present.
This would represent the first Glosa dictionary that is freely available on
the Net.
    My understanding is that people wish to have a list that presents them
with few, or no, choices.  Yet they would like to have enough words to make
meaningful communication possible. 
    If the selection makes the language attractive enough, new learners are
likely to add to their vocabulary by getting the printed Glosa 6000
dictionary.

*   On proper names, the authors advise that a minimal change in lettering
be observed.  While "Africa" might become ~Afrika~ to conform with Glosa
pronunciation rules, "Mississippi" would remain ~Mississippi~ because it
cuts across no pronunciation rules, and looks more like the original than
*Misisipi*.
    With personal names, I have a little more trouble: There is NO Glosa
equivalent to the standard "J" sound of English.  In Glosa ~J~ is sounded
like the "Y" in "yond."  Probably we will have to say that "John" is either
~Djon~ or ~Jon~ (maybe ~John~) with that funny English "J" that is like
~dz~ - but not quite - plus a silent ~H~.
    The Glosa ~G~ provides a similar problem in that there is NO 'soft G',
so we get back to the mystery of the missing "J", again.  Will "George
Washington" be introduced to unsuspecting millions as 
gAY'ORrgAY wAHsEEn'tORn - with a silent G in the second word, but two hard
G's in the first?
   Are there any clues about handling this problem from other Planned
Languages?  Maybe we will just have to tell people that ~George Washington~
is pronounced "George Washington" because it comes from an ancient language
with very irregular spelling, and the English talk funny.
   Suggestions, anyone?

   On the question of specialist vocabularies, no: there has been no
activity.  BUT there should be some planning as to how to fit them in to
the existing structure of the language.
   We need to put effort into the basic use of the lenguage still, so have
no resources for specialist dictionaries.  also,such things need the
efforts of specialists!
   I can imagine that, one day, we will 'load up' additional vocabularies
to read specialist material using the terminology of one or more areas of
interest.  If the writer of an article uses teminology from specialist
lexicons, then he/she would indicate which vocabulary lists are needed if
people are going to word-process, machine-handle, or just plain make
dictionary reference.
   The analogy is given by Java programming: at the top of an applet, the
programmer calls up the subroutines he will need during the running of the
applet, EG p218 "Java Programming for Dummies"
 import java.awt.*;
 import java.applet.*;
 import java.lang.*;

   In a similar way specialist Glosa lexicons can be called up into RAM so
that they will be available for the word-processor, Machine-Translator or
dictionary-reader.  This would provide a limit, saying that while writing
the item, you were using words only from the stated list of lexicons.
Needless to say, particular terms outside the stated lists could be given
in an additional listing.

*   We all agree with the idea of a _Glosa by Example_ grammar book using
fully formed sentences to demonstrate the rules.  This can be worked on
concurrently with the creation of a Net Dictionary: there are scads of
words that are not in contention; these could be used to make up sentences
for a _Mechanics of Glosa_.
    In my mind, I have a list of the principles of Glosa's Syntax-based
Grammar, and I should outline them on this list so that other can comment,
ammend, etc.  Once such a list of principles is finalised to everyone's
satisfaction, then we could go to the next phase, of fleshing out the
principles with examples.
QUESTIONS:-
 . Is there a set of principles of Glosa's grammar?
 . If there is a set of Grammatical rules applying to Glosa can we produce
a definitive list?
 . Do people see a booklet (or webpage) with rules stated, then a series of
examples following each rule?
 . Or is there some thought of teaching by example only, without resort to
didacticism?

which the "Mechanics" are illustrated.  This would be more imaginative, but

that a grammar book would put people off, so discouraged action on this
some years ago.  Once we decide on the form of a "Mechanics" we should send
a copy of either the 'rules', or examples of some of the text, for checking.

    You have the idea.  Some sort of text narrative showing how it all
fits together.  For one thing, a connected text would demonstrate that
it is simply not necessary to mark everything under the sun all the
time as western European languages do.  There may be people whose
native languages do not mark tense all the time, and they may wonder
why Glosa is inflected like Latin if tense and aspect are always being
marked.  If they leave out the markers when they are not strictly
necessary, those who have become over-accustomed to marking everything
may have trouble understanding.  Also, a text narrative would give more
of the feel of the language than just isolated phrases and sentences. 
As for being "harder to do," if it is too hard, then that would mean
that it would be too hard to use Glosa at all.

I was thinking about this a little, and *IF* everyone wanted
to participate through the web using a browser, it would not be
difficult to write a little Perl/CGI script to display the
list with comments interspersed. Something like ...

>: (Glosa word 455) ...
>: (Glosa word 456) - (English translation)
>:    comment 1 - this word is excellent!
>:    comment 2 - this word is terrible!!
>: (Glosa word 457) - ...
...
>: Add your comment here: .........

If this is desired, I could make a mock-up page.
It could be kept "secret" so only our cabal sees it.

As I commented on AUXLANG, this problem really must
get resolved, and soon. The grammar is dangerously
under-specified. Is a given word to be a "verb" by
default? Then its dictionary entry had better say so.
Otherwise you must mark it. Mixed strategy is common,
but in Glosa it isn't even decided what the rules are.

Well, Peano did it in a famous address, changing Latin
to Latino Sin Flexione on the fly ...

Another way is to take the "GUM" and translate each idiom.

    For myself, it would be easier to have a flat ASCII file I
could download to my PC and consider/manipulate at my leisure. 
My web access is a little primitive, and last month my phone
bill was higher than expected due to greater online time.  I
could handle it several ways: a file sent out by email,
something stashed in an ftp library somewhere, or a bare
<pre>...</pre> web page I could print to a file and download.

    This is perhaps due to Clark&Ashby's individual predilection. 
They seem to have an aversion to anything that smacks of formal
grammar.  Witness their absurd claim (perhaps not made of late) that
"Glosa has no grammar."  From a communication I once received from one
of them, I got the idea that they -deliberately- do not participate
in IAL exchanges such as AUXLANG and don't even try to satisfy the
wants of "formal scholarship."  They seem to think that informality
and non-specification will carry the world.  Sorry, but I don't buy
it.  I have to some extent changed my thinking on something like the
paedagogy of Glosa (or whatever), but I agree that the grammar is
under-specified.  There seems to be the dangerous unritten, unspoken
precept, "Otherwise do it as in English."

    I wonder if this is so in all cases.  Contemporary English swaps
words around among parts of speech, and the marking is a little flimsy
at times.

    To some extent I agree.  I do not think that the basic structure
needs to be changed.  I just think that it needs some cleaning up and
better specification.

    Quite a long time ago, Robin sent me a grammar specification
he had worked up.  I sent it back with comments, but as I recall
I generally thought it was a good start.  Unfortunately, my copy
has apparently fallen to long-ago disk housecleaning.  But if
Robin still has it (especially with my comments, of course :-) ),
it might be something of worth.

It isn't that I mind their flying in the face of linguistic
scholarship that really bothers me; it's the practical issues
that arise, such as your desire to minimize the pseudo-articles
and such, and are not plainly answerable except by force of
numbers ("let usage decide").

I found what appears a very reasonable description of how
lexical categories are marked (or not) in real languages:
*** http://www.epas.utoronto.ca/~dbeck/lextheory.HTML ***
and I would like to know which of the 4 possible language
types Glosa wants to be.

Any one of the basic types would be OK, but would have
implications. Then we could be secure in our understanding
of how "u/plu" should work, etc. This would be A Good Thing.

It is accounted for neatly by the theory (URL)
above. English is both "Head/dependent sensitive"
and "Predicate/object sensitive", so it has distinct
lexical classes of noun, adjective, or verb for all
the open-class words. By default, a given word is, say,
a verb, but can become an adjective by adding a suffix
like "-ing". In contrast, Tagalog is negative on both;
so function must always be marked. EXCEPT that when
"obvious", elision is possible -- all langs do that.

Or we could "let usage decide", which isn't going
to work out well, since influence of the native lang
will decide it differently in each case. And if we
default to English, then every word must be default-
marked as to part of speech in the dictionary;
I think nobody here wants that. Or ... ??!?!!

Yes, I can agree with that statement, except that
the word "just" is the nastiest word in English.
In other words, it really has to be done, and
might not be easy at all.

    My position has been that markers should be used only when
necessary for disambiguation.  However, I am open to it being
demonstrated that markers may be necessary more frequently than 
I have hitherto thought.

    One problem I have had is that without a more consistent,
agreed-upon vocabulary (including one sufficient to discuss Glosa 
in Glosa), I have been reluctant to put more effort into "original"
composition and discussion thereof.  And for me, wordlists pretty 
much need to be manipulable offline with an editor (not, e.g.,
restricted to the web).

Thank you for that vote of confidence! And also thanks for all the
URLs you've been passing on to us.

Paul has remarked on the overuse of markers in English and the tendency
of this overuse to migrate into Glosa. We agree that markers should not
be used when the information is redundant. For example, above... since
I'm replying on 26 Dec. to a message that charles sent on 25 Dec., it is
sufficient to say "charles skribe" rather than "charles pa skribe".

As I've said before, one of the things I like about Glosa but probably
want to push further than the authors had in mind is this idea of concept
words. But if a word can be a noun, verb, adjective, whatever, then the
use of markers can be of even greater importance than they might be in
other languages. Consider the sentence "A B C D E F G". Even knowing
that it's in Glosa, headfinal and all that, if each of those words A
through G could represent any part of speech, how could we possibly know
where the subject ends and the verb begins? But we also know that even
in Glosa there are words that will never be used as verbs (though I will
certainly try!), so, as charles noted, knowledge of which words can and
cannot be which parts of speech would certainly aid in the parsing, and
I'm sure that much of this will come relatively simply and automatically.
But if these words and their allowable parts of speech must be learned,
would this not be a hindrance to learning and usage, and does it not
tarnish the idea of concept words?

My feeling is that while truly redundant markers should and will
disappear, some others will pop up to resolve ambiguous situations,
and in so doing may appear to introduce redundancy in other ways,
though their true purpose is not redundancy.

Just a quick comment on synonyms. Though it's been a while since I looked
closely, I do recall that there were many words in the lexikon which were
synonymous if their parts of speech were ignored. We should probably be
paring down these synonyms too, though this process would be pushing us
closer to my ideal of the concept-word language, and might thus actually
cause more trouble with parsing.

And I'll also point out one example that simultaneously intrigues and
disturbs me...

   U tri feli...   The three cats...

   U feli tri...   The third cat...

Intrigues, because it's so concept-wordy. Disturbs, because I don't think
I would have come up with a "catty third" on my own. (And I'm still not
sure that I like this form. It doesn't seem quite robust enough but I can't
quite say why. Anyway...) Maybe with practice, and certainly with a hint -
but no way would I have come up with that on my own! We *do* need a grammar!

*   In a short answer: no there is no reason why an interested Glosa-pe
cannot take over some of the Glosa work on the Net!
    On this, I personally am guided by the existing range of words in
existing, printed Glosa dictionaries.  If a word is there, but is part of a
range of spellings, then, when a good case is given for preferring the one
over the others, it becomes the chosen form.
    Regarding synonyms, it is obvious that both words are usable, buti it
just becomes a matter of selection, to choose the most suitable one for use
in the Net dictionary.
    I try to avoid inventing words that are not in the printed
dictionaries, or have been printed at one time.  EG ~utor~ [employ] this
word was derived by me from the Latin dictionary; and, considering that I
wanted to use the concept "employ", which was not covered by the Glosa
6000, I simply derived the word using the same process that the authors
would have used.
    A more difficult case is the logical function-word "that": I and others
use this 'archaic' form in our thinking and speech, EG "It was so cold that
he died."  In Glosa this used to be ~ke~ [that], but this Esperanto
'loan-word' was dropped, and Wendy pointed out to me that I was using Old
Glosa.
  EG  U meteo habe ta frigo; ke un andra pa morta.
 glos. the weather had so much cold, that the man did die

   This usage was shortened from  ~ ; ke ~  to  ~ ; ~ .   I did not enjoy
this death of a word, nor of the sounding of the concept.  I have seen in
some Glosa the use of ~u-la~ to express the logical function, when it means
"the there".
   I miss this word and wish to see it re-instated in the Glosa dictionary.

a few words, can you describe the final effect that you wish to achieve.
    And yes, the Glosa authors are not rushing in to set up a whole
narative demonstrating all of the points of Glosa's grammar, so, if you or
I don't do it, it is likely not to get done.

    If Fred prints the "Xingalong Dictionary" and Harry photocopies it and
reprints it, as it stands, then Harry has infringed Fred's copyright.
Even if Harry retypes the Xingalong List exactly and sells it or gives it
away, then Fred probably has a case in court against Harry.  But once Harry
starts creatively playing with the Xingalong List extending it, or
shortening it, then Fred's lawyer might warn him that he is likely to lose,
if he takes Harry to court. The rule might be that you can copyright a
dictionary, but you can't copyright a language.  
    One last thought.  Fred needs to pay his lawyer: without the ^green

*   Q1: No.  But there aren't many others doing things.  I, for instance,
asked to be Glosa agent for Australia, and they suggested "Glosa Agent for
NSW".  
     I suggested a Glosa Supergroup comprising the activists, wherever they
were: the main response was that the authors couldn't work out how to
administer such a group.  I was on Conlang and Auxlang for some years
before I decided that I should try to establish a Glosa Mailing List.
     "Delegation of authority" has been a theme in my letters with the
authors, but they seem to have been a bit slow responding to this idea.  I
have strongly recommended that they set up a clear Management Structure
together with a solid Business Plan for Glosa, and there was some movement.
 I have slowed down a bit because of health, but am picing up speed again.

    But it is agreed, Clark and Ashby do not own Glosa, and anyone else can
set up a Glosa publication, Webpage or Mailing List.  But, I have seen
nothing of other administration in Glosa beyond mine and that of Banobi
Herbert of the Mountain Gorilla Park in Uganda.  Originally an Oden Smith
did run a good structure of Glosa groups in Uganda, but sadly
he died, and no-one has taken up his mantle.
    As far as I am concerned, Glosa can start breaking out like grass-fires
all over.  There should, by now, be a network of Glosa Mailing Lists: I
wish there were.
    Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby might be a genii, but they still have things
to learn about running a business.

*   When I originally registered "Glosa Communication" as a trading name,
they were a bit surprised.  The Bahai, Paul Easton, released the Glosa
Classified list (1000 words) because it seemed the sensible thing to do.  I
agreed that his action was correct, but had been asked not to release Glosa
6000 on the Net prior to this.
    There are restrictions but they are based on pre-electronic publishing
principles.  One reason for my starting the Glosalist was to gather a
concensus for releasing a Glosa Internet Dictionary.  It is an idea whose
time has come, even if the Glosa authors do not know it.  At 62, and with
one stent, I have decided to do the right thing rather than the allowed
thing: having spent twenty years with Glosa, it is no wonder that I
sometimes lapse into Old Glosa.  Also, I could retire from active language
promotion ... or could keep promoting Glosa: I might as well give it my
best shot, considering I don't know how long I can continue doing so.

*   Please Paul, you do take me too literally: I was using "every second
word" in ^round figures^.  I have no idea what size an optimal dictionary  
would have until I start looking.
    One thing that is, however, certain is that I was unhappy with Glosa
when I was restricted to the shorter, Glosa 1000 dictionary.  It was only
after the Glosa 6000 was published that I discovered the elegance of Glosa,
and found that I could express myself as I wished.  So, for my own
purposes, I do not know how much of the 6000 list I could comfortably do
without.  If you add to Glosa 1000, and I cut from Glosa 6000, we will meet
somewhere at the median point.
    And here's the cruncher.  For economic reasons the authors prefer to
disseminate Glosa via the Glosa 1000 list.  If others felt the same
restriction that I got from this list, it might easily suggest that others
failed to get satisfaction from this shorter list, too.  I dreamt of using
DTP to create further copies of Glosa 6000, and now with the P2 and an
Epson Stylus 440, I might be able to do this ... for free dispersal to Africa.

>>>> So, I hope that others set up Glosa groups all around the world.
     The Ownership of the 1000 and 6000 lists is with the Glosa Educational
Organisation, which is a charity in U.K.
     A Net dictionary will be also marked with the GEO copyright, but this
will have little real effect, since no-one will be inclined to send a
"Registration" to Richmond, UK, though an invitation to this effect will be
extended.

A wonderful way of putting it! I doubt there are very many people
around who would think of it that way. Well, probably many more in
this language community than elsewhere. Anyway, though I haven't
done much with my AEP, see http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/aep.htm

I think you're right about that legal distinction, dictionary vs.
language. But the real question is, what's the right thing to do?
Quite frankly, while I'd never hesitate to violate a Microsoft
copyright (considering what they've done to my computing world)
I wouldn't want to work against Ashby and Clark even if I had the
legal right to do so.

Maybe it's time to do a Loglan/Lojban type spinoff. We could almost
claim a new language simply by defining the grammar!

So it's back in, because "ke/that" is indispensible for clear
writing and speech. I would eliminate ";" instead.

So a new dictionary is OK to produce and distribute,
even if it disagrees with the A&C canon.

Yes, exactly.

Ack! you mean "dialect". Yes, the "internet dialect" of Glosa.
More chance of growing rapidly on the net than in Uganda,
no offense to Third World countries intended.

Nope.  The IAL world does not need more fragmentation.

    How do other languages handle this sort of subordination?  "It 
was so cold that the old man died."  Here, "that" is a conjunctive
expressing result or causation.  Elsewhere in English, "that" often
merely introduces a noun clause.  English "that" is a slippery word,
just like the abominable "get."  I do not think we should introduce
these ambiguities into Glosa.

Klima es ta frigi; seqe-co gero-an gene morta.

Forget 'ke'/"that" in such a case.

    Why should they have to administer such a group at all?  My
consideration is that the best think Zamenhof ever did for Esperanto
was to take his hands off of it.  He remained the exemplar of good
usage and answered a lot of questions, but he unequivocally put it 
the public domain.  A very, very wise decision, in my estimation.  
And he did not get rich off of Esperatno, either.

    Management Structure?  Business Plan?  Why not just let is spread
without a lot of bureaucracy?  James Cooke Brown tried to keep a
stranglehold on Loglan and succeeded only in running up large legal
fees in a messy court battle he eventually lost.  Eiffel, I am told,
was a relatively good computer programming language, but the author
tried to keep a stranglehold on it, and now it is probably pretty much
dead.  As harsh as it may sound, Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby are going 
to have to realize that if they tie Glosa to their personal lives,
including their personal finances, its future is bleak at best.

    I agree.

    Plausible notion.

    Except that there is -NO- "Glosa 1000" list.  Their published lists
of "Glosa 1000" are inconsistent, which has been a point of mine all
along.

    This sounds like a blurring between copyrighting a language and
copyrighting a document.  If a language cannot be copyrighted but much
of its content -- vocabulary lists -- can, then the practical effect
of the language not being copyrighted is largely vitiated.

    Keep the existing paradigmatic phrases and sentences in the
Mechanics of Glosa (perhaps conflated from its various forms, as I
tried to do on the www pages).  They are fine as far as they go and
usefully demonstrate a lot of usages.  But taken in isolation they do
not give a subjective "feel" for the language nor demonstrate how it
fits together on a larger scale.

    Nice to hear that you are not anxious about the dictionary.  But to
keep everyone happy, we may as well fix on a standard vocabulary with
regular spelling.  After recovering from dictionaritis, we will be able to
get on with the task of using the language creatively.

*   No, words were never intended to BE parts of speech, but to function as
different parts of speech, depending on their syntax, and it has always
been so.  
 EG An ki habe u kurso.  ........ kurso  [run] 'noun' = functions as noun
    An kurso longi u via.  ...... kurso  [run] 'verb' = functions as verb

   Some words by their very semantics find it hard to function as anything
else but a verb, and others as a noun, but the rule is just as fresh today
as it was twenty years ago:- 
  "A word may, within reason, function as any part of speech, depending on
its syntax.

*   Hello Ron and Wendy,
     I won't know if you get this message, but Ido hope your computer is
now operational again.
     Charles mentions that there are a number of "free sites" around the
Net, and that there are some minimal cost deals, as well.  I would pay
half, if necessary, to ensure that you could put out a Webpage.

    The "2.5K" idea is for the setting up of a Net dictionary that is put
into the Public Domain, so that it is freely available to allcomers.  I do
like the 6000 word-list, but Paul Bartlett and a few others prefer a
shorter First Dictionary, so we will do a compilation of 2000 - 2500 words
to get the Cyberions in.

    It looks like it will be a bit tricky to work through a
cyberspace-committee to reduce the Glosa 6000 to a third of its bulk.  But
there were three things suggesting the need for a recast:-
  . spelling irregularities throughout the 6000 and various 1000 lists,
  . a surplus of synonyms - or simply the presence of synonyms,
 &. the stated desire for a Starter Dictionary shorter than the 6000, but
longer than the 1000.

    These matters have prevented the Glosalist subscribers from actively
writing in Glosa up to now.  Well, agreed, they didn't stop me, but I must
be tough or thick skinned.  If the Glosalist subscribers are any measure of
the affluents in cyberspace, then we must be doing something wrong, because
very few of those connected to the Net have transcribed stories into Glosa:
I have seen none from other computer-owners yet.
     Considering the Internet is an open forum, and anyone anywhere with a
Network connection can trawl the Net to find my Webpage, I would say that
the members of Auxlang, and especially the members of the Glosalist, are at
the leading edge of World Language Reform; so, we ought to be able to
'catch' some of them, at least.  If these open-minded souls are acting shy,
then we have little hope of drawing in the less-interested majority of
humanity ... with the present offering.
     "Standardisation" is the catch-word behind the "2.5K" idea.  I now am
convinced that there is much less ''suspension of judgment'' around than we
had hoped for.  It looks as if the educated intelligentsia using the
Internet has effectively been taught to dot all it "I"s and cross all its
"T"s, and to reject work that fails to measure up to this prescribed standard.
     I am trying hard to distil a shorter Net Dictionary, with no spelling
irregularities and virtually NO synonyms: hopefully such a dictionary will
allow our potential Glosa-pe on the Net to discover their creativity, at
last.  
     For myself, I still recommend Glosa 6000 for creative purposes, and I
enjoy the luxury of being able to call "water" variously ~aqa~ or ~hidra~;
but, my values are not those of the majority of Glosalist subscribers, so,
for the sake of results, I feel it necessary to bend my effort to the
concensus view.

Saluta, 
 Robin Gaskell
  P.S. Wendy, how has the house-selling gone?

vocabularies ... and you would aim to find the bi-syllabic "conceptual

words with either  CVCV or CV-CV structure?  The latter technique was used
to define the various consonant-vowel doubles that were the building blocks
of the Huna language (CV-CV-CV-CV).

    Thank you for this inspiration, Paul.

    Quite frankly this is an ideal opportunity for Glosalistas who would be
Glosa-pe to get started.
 
    Now, there are a number of features of Glosa grammar that could be
demonstrated in the body of a text | narative | description | etc.

    It might be possible to introduce and repeat a grammatical principle in
one installment, and then introduce and repeat another in a subsequent
installment, and so on.  Is this idea of a serialised story what you had in
mind, Paul?

    The alternative device is to treat quite different situations in
subsequent texts, choosing situations in which one grammatical principle
can occur a number of times.  This is the more standard Grammar book trick.
 And it would suit us on the Glosalist if different people chose to create
various texts featuring this, or that, grammatical principle.

    For reasons of group spirit, I would prefer it if we could work,
co-operatively, on the various installments of a connected narative, using
the same heros and heroines who keep cropping up in different (grammatical)
situations.
    Having happy memories of the other-ness of French culture from Franch
lessons, at school, I imagine a Fifi and a Herbert (pronounced in Glosa, of
course) being our major protagonists.  We'll need another couple of
Cosmopolitans to flesh out the plot, and then we'll need a reason for
telling the tale.  What action do we want in the story: a bank robbery, a
traffic accident, a traumatic lottery win, etc, OR all of the above, and more?

    Paul, did you imagine this as primarily a Mailing List sequence, or as
something that would fit an episode onto a page for printing and mailing ..
or both?  I still have to learn how to use the Word97/Epson440
pair in DTP mode, and if I abbr. my blips I might get time to study the new
equip.
    I have imagined that the various grammatical principles can be noted in
a margin left for such comments.  If this ran down the RHS of the page, it
could even be marked off with a vertical line.  If used, would we wish to
give the Grammar its Glosa name, or would we use English?  I favour Glosa
on the page - with a key at the end of the book giving English equivalents,
and leaving space for the pen additions of language-X equivalents.
    
   Right, gang: we need more names, and situations you might be happy to
write grammatical sequences about.

Hedo Nov-anua,
 Robin Gaskell
   P.S.  Hands up all those who would like a thumb-nail sketch of the
points of Glosa grammar that ought to come up in our Demo-narative.
       If we like doing the first one, we might do another, etc.

Time is the problem, indeed ... the only one worse than money.
I could donate a share of the cost too.

They allow you to install "Smartlist", which looks pretty good:
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/SmartList.FEATURES
But I have not tried it myself.

I don't think fancy features are needed, but here they are:

With a hosting service, the costs are not hidden;
and no ads, and high performance (unlike Geocities).

I think it *is* very important, but I trust you guys to do it.
I'm not strong on lexicon myself; I'd just pick Ido words.
They did a very good job ... look at this:

    Uh, no, as a matter of fact.  I was thinking of just a long
paragraph or two is all.  I generally like the overall purpose of 
the existing booklets.  I only think that they need to be expanded
somewhat: enhanced and regularized vocabulary, perhaps with the
categorizations at the end (which might, of course, entail some
repetition) together with the Mechanics expanded to include a connected
paragraph or two.  Pretty much like the current Glosa Basic Reference
on the www.  It could still be printed up as a booklet -- in various
languages, of course -- only somwhat, but not greatly, larger than the
existing booklets.  They would be relatively cheap to produce (compared, 
say, to a book, even paperbound).

    To the best of my knowledge, SmartList is one of the simplest
mailing list servers to administer (compared, say, to Majordomo, 
Listserv, or Listproc).

Glosa has 2 major advantages over other IALs;
it has SVO analytic type (known to be the easiest)
and it uses CV phonology (ditto). CV implies there
will be approximately 100 distinct syllables,
so there can be a maximum of 10000 bi-syllabic words.
That should more than suffice for an easy-to-learn
yet complete vocabulary, assuming that users can
easily compound or "adjectivize" (use modifiers).

This is the one that collects essential word lists.
It ought to save you a lot of time and energy ...

No, these are the basic phrases needed for real-life speech.
They could serve as the basis for a useful phrase-book,
a non-"grammatical" approach like (but more rigorous than)
the paltry Glosa examples given currently ...

xxx IS A yyy ............ a tomato is a plant
THERE IS xxx ............ there's a bug on the tomato plants
xxx'S yyy, yyy OF xxx ... the plant's fruit, fruit of the plant
xxx IS CALLED yyy ....... this tomato is a Hogben's Folly

And so on. These are the basic idioms of *any* language.
Unless they are specified, it will be "as in English",
which is not a serious option at all!

Again, using previous research is not a tedious chore,
it is a labor-saving device and ensures success.

Every language has the ability to use words of one class
as another, by some mechanism. It is OK to avoid the terms
"verb" and "noun" in teaching, but it would be silly to claim
Glosa does not have them; there are NO languages without them.
Some langs do not have true adjectives; I think it is clear
that Glosa DOES, as in English but unlike Chinese.

Then, word-order determines class. This implies
that particles must mark the phrase transitions,
like the dashes in "subject-verb-object".

Also, hyphenation is the way of modifying modifiers when there
are more than one (otherwise word order is insufficient).

I disagree ... And it is poor strategy,
making Glosa lean on a natlang for support.

> There are the function words which act as prepositions, interrogatives

So really, like Chinese, Glosa has 2 classes of words,
the open class of verbs/nouns/modifiers or "full words",
and the closed class of particles or "empty words".

    But there is a real problem of how we collect and collate opinions.
If it does run through the Mailing List - is not too big - then I can
imagine using Galaxy macros to rule up a table ... 6000 rows long (?!?)

    So, if some Glosalistas sent in tricky sentences - in English or Glosa
- where the need for "disambiguation" is arguable, I would have a go at
maintaining their non-ambiguity with 'elegance', by rendering them into
what seems passable Glosa to me ... with, or without, the "U" and "PA".

other appraoch when writing children's stories in Glosa: I knew the
word-lists were inconsistent, but decided to get something out, so I could
'test' the language
beyond the dictionary level, anyway.  _Cinerala_ for example, might have
some odd spellings, and could contain a bit of Old Glosa, but basically it
can be understood well by the average educated person armed with a Glosa 6000.
    You want to write from a position of subjective certainty about the
medium you are using: I respect this.  Maybe others on this List are also
hanging back for the same reason; I must expedite the 'standardisation'
process!

    It is the logical nature of English sentence construction that might be
a criterion for Glosa. 
   But it would now seem that the style of Glosa's grammar is ^loose, and
flapping^, and needs to be tied down securely.
   I guess that I saw this problem coming, back in 1994, when I attempted a
description of the grammar.  And it looks as if it's time to revive such
thoughts (V1.3 sent to Glosalist).

    If your system prevents the reception of "Attachments" but you want
this file, I will find a way of getting it to you.

   SBG V1.3 is simply a description of how Glosa is supposed to work,
syntactically.  I have added a few items that are not official "Richmond"
rulings.  However, because the Glosa authors have shied away from
publishing a Grammar-Book, the SBG.GLS is something that I had to compile
from distributed data in the Glosa publications and from personal experience.

   Re Old Glosa: The authors introduced a number of features , which have
since been discontinued.  Two, that I am loathe to see go, are the 'logical
"that"' ~ke~, and the Past Perfect tense particle [= had] ~pra~.  On

can hash it over on a time-available basis.  In the meantime, I will
respond to one paragraph.

    I am not at all clear by what you mean by a "logical" 'that'.  In
English, 'that' has a multitude of uses.  Which one or ones are you
talking about?  Most frequently when I have seen you use it, you were
using the equivalent of a 'that' which introduces an English noun
clause.  However, in the example which came up the other day, 'that'
was used very differently and in such a way that I think an entirely
other construct should be used in Glosa.  'That' is about as slippery
as 'get', and idiosyncratic English usages should -not- be ported over
with all their confusions into an auxlang.

    As for 'pra', why does Glosa have to ape the confusing English
tense structure, which also tends to confuse tense and aspect.  Just
listen to a lot of Russian adult learners of English and their
dfifficulties with English tense structure.  Russian, to the best of my
knowledge, differentiates much more clearly than does English between
tense and aspect.  The English past perfect tense tends to blend a
perfective aspect and a past tense.  I am -not- in favor of 'pra'.  Are
you letting yourself be unduly influenced by English again?

This gets into ambiguous modifiers ...
The infamous "pretty little girl".
Then: "a pretty little girl school".
It can get even worse in German.

I suppose the answer is to use hyphenation plus
genitive particles plus conjunctions. A definite
article might help if there were any, but there
aren't. That's OK with me, one should be able to
use "some" "same" "any" and that sort of more
specific quantifying modifier to much better effect.

I think the result is going to be that any noun
phrase over 3 words long will need a heavy pause
at the end. If we had any French speakers, they
might prefer to use a more theme-rheme style here:
"The pretty little girl school, it is big." ...
versus "The pretty little girl school is big."

Then there is the multiple preposition phrase:
"I saw the man chasing the cat with a broom
in underwear".

Then there's the direct/indirect transition:
"I sent it to him but he gave her something else".

Now one of my favorites, "He was red, she was a Red".
Well, you said no part-of-speach marking allowed ...

(These are just warm-up, practice problems.)

Relative clauses do need to be defined or proscribed;
pidgins often don't have them. Rick Morneau says:
ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/r/ram/conlang/Syntax
(and actually, he says it all ...)

I think you are correct, but I don't have a good URL
that describes the near-universal pidgin aspect system.
Glosa's is already more complex than that. Certainly
past and perfect should not be combined in one particle.
Ido, after much resistance, did eventually add both a
passive (like "gene"?) and perfective suffix/particle, IIRC.

I was thinking of accumulating all the comments
in a separate file, like this ...

	BAZAR	CAG	cool
	BDELA	CAG	no way
	BAZAR	RG	keep
	BASANO	RG	too abstruse

But on the web page, the comments would be merged
into the selected set of words, and formatted nicely;
there would be a form at the bottom like so:

	Glosa word(s): .............
	Your comment: .....................
	Your initials: ....

But, too many people don't want to sit around on-line
in the browser. I have unlimited cheap access so
for me the browser is *the* interface of choice.

Maybe the thing to do, then, is just have people
mail Robin directly with their "kill/keep" lists.
It would be nice to list one word per line so
it is easily sortable by the "sort" utility
(which I believe still exists in M$DOS in some form).

    Definitely.

    However, in Ido they are distinct suffixes, '-ab-' for 
perfective and '-is' for past.  Glosa already has a sort-of 
inmperfective particle, 'du'.  One could, I suppose, use the 
opposition formant 'no-' to create '*no-du' as a perfective 
particle, although I am not overly thrilled about that.  Some 
conIALs use an adverb meaning roughly "already" as a sort of 
quasi-perfective.  Glosa has 'pre-nu' for "already," but the 
'-nu' conveys some meaning of currentness of time, so I wouldn't 
think it would be all that suitable as a perfective.

    I occasionally use a freeware sort for DOS which is much 
more powerful than the clunky sort that comes wiht DOS itself.

But "ja" is aleady taken and has the wrong sound.
How about "za" ... ?

    Whenever possible I am in favor of trying to use already existing
resources instead of making words up.  As for the aspect particles
generally, I plan soon to post some comments about Robin's grammar
statement.  I have to give fair warning that I am not gentle with the
overall verb system -description-, not most of the verb system as such,
which I think can be generally workable if concepts are sorted out.  In
fact, I think that a perfective marker is the only major thing lacking
in the Glosa verb system.

    SYNTAX-BASED GRAMMAR  OF  GLOSA        with no Part-of-Speech markers)

{ Strictly speaking, no part-of-speech markers as components of words
{ themselves.  'U(n)/plu' mark substantives.
 _________________________________________________________________________

_____>>>  1. Basic Structure

      A. The phrase is the unit of the language.

{ I thought that words are the units of a language (except in so-called
{ polysynthetic languages in which even the concept of "word" is a
{ little blurry).

         i. There are:- noun phrases
                        verb phrases
                        adverbial phrases &
                        adjectival phrases

        ii. Within a phrase, a word is modified by its precedent, and
             there is a gradual increase in significance, i.e. the
             first word is least significant, with words increasing in
             significance to the last word, which is the most significant.

{ What about the particles 'u(n)/plu'?  They may appear in a multi-word
{ phrase but apply generally to the final word of the phrase, not to the
{ immediately succeeding word.

      B. Phrases combine to form a sentence (major clause) comprising:-

{ In normal terminology, a sentence may consist solely of a major
{ clause, but "sentence" and "major clause" are distinct.  Most
{ importantly, does Glosa even NEED an elaborate clause structure?

               a. one clause (the Major Clause) OR

               b. clauses (Main & Subordinate Clause[s]) (= Major Clause)

{ What is the equal sign referring to here?  Why does "(= Major Clause)"
{ even appear under this item?

         i. Subordinate clauses may be:- adverbial clauses &
                                         adjectival clauses

{ Why no noun clauses?

        ii. Within a clause, the sequence is:- Subject, Verb, [Object].

             A Major Clause comprises:-

               a. Noun Phrase - Verb phrase - Noun Phrase
                                                  - with a transitive verb

{ In some languages, such as English, a noun phrase can follow a
{ verb without being an object: the so-called predicate nominative,
{ which complements the verb but refers to the subject without being
{ an object of the verb.

               b. Noun Phrase - Verb Phrase
                   OR   Noun Phrase - Verb Phrase - Dependent Phrase
                                            (usually an Adverbial Phr.)
                                               - with an intransitive verb

{ Could be an adjectival phrase as a predicate adjective:  "The house
{ next door appears red to me."  "U para-domi feno es rubi per u vide."
{ "Red"/'rubi' is a single-word predicate adjectival phrase as a
{ predicate modifier of the subject.  (In these instances I will agree
{ that 'u' is appropriate.)

      C. Phrases and clauses can be combined to form a Major Clause.

         i. An Adverbial Clause follows immediately after the verb or Verb
             Phrase it modifies, with a colon (:) marking the start of the
             clause, and a comma(,) indicating its completion.

{ This is the first time I recall seeing use of a colon in this context.
{ The whole issue of punctuation in Glosa may need to be revisited.
{ The written form of a language is a crystallization, so to speak, of
{ speech.  Lojban has "verbal punctuation," but I don't know how to
{ speak some of this punctuation in Glosa.}

        ii. An Adjectival Clause follows immediately after the noun or Noun
             Phrase it qualifies, with a semi-colon (;) marking the start
             of the clause, and a comma (,) indicating its completion.

{ See above for predicate adjectival phrases.

       iii. Clauses and phrases, if elided (with function words omitted),
             are still treated as the full phrase or clause .. for purposes
             of syntax analysis .. and the necessary punctuation is used.

_____>>>  2. Precedence
              RULE: A word or phrase is modified by its precedent.

{ This is merely a duplication of 1.A.ii above.

      D. i. In the Major Clause, there is a tendency for the first noun
             phrase (subject) to modify the verb phrase, and then the verb
             phrase modifies the second noun phrase (object).

{ I have never heard of subjects "modifying" verbs, nor of verbs
{ "modifying" objects.

        ii. In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-
             determinant - number - quantity - modifier(s) - noun
              Note. the concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

{ Incidentally, concept and word are NOT the same thing.  Using them
{ interchangeably just contributes to the notion that the presentation
{ of Glosa is sloppy.  And a sloppy presentation will cause a lot of
{ people not to take the language seriously -- and not just professional
{ linguists, either.

       iii. In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
             tense particle - negative - modifier - auxiliary verb -
                                              verb OR verboid + amplifier

{ Why not negative before tense particle?  As for "verboid," I have
{ never encountered this term outside of Interglossa and Glosa.  It
{ seems not to be well definded.

              Again. the concept/word used as a verb is the only element
              of a verb phrase that is essential.

_____>>>  3. Function Words
              These introduce clauses, give logical relationships between
               clauses; negatives, interrogatives and conjunctions.

{ What about 'u(n)/plu', which in recent discussions have been referred
{ to as function words?  The terminology needs to be tightened up some
{ here.

      E. Clauses that follow the words they qualify:-

         i. An adverbial clause following a verb (: ke).  [[Old Glosa]]

{ I have also seen, as best I recall, 'ke' introducing a noun clause
{ in the Gaskell-Glosa dialect.  And again, I have never encountered
{ this use of the colon before.

        ii. A relative pronoun after a noun introduces an adjectival
             clauses (; qi).

      F. Adverbial clauses can start with a range of function words:-

         i. Logical comparatives e.g. anti-co.

        ii. Time words e.g. kron.

       iii. Location words e.g. topo.

        iv. Conjunctions e.g. te.

         v. Spatial relationship words e.g. dia.

      G. Interrogatives

         i. Simple question: "qe" followed by positive statement (Qe, -.)

        ii. `What' questions use "qod" (Qod es .. ).

       iii. Specific questions e.g. Qo-lo habe u .. .

      H. Negation

         i. Negating a verb place "ne" before it.

        ii. No thing or none of a substantive (nuli).

       iii. Negative statement (No!)

        iv. Opposition (anti)

{ Normally 'no-' forms opposites: 'ne-frigi' "not cold (but not
{ necessarily hot"; 'no-frigi' "hot".

         v. Neither .. nor (ni .. ni)

{ You might want to include "either .. or" for completeness.

        vi. An empty value (zero)

      I. Conjunctions combine equivalent elements of sentences

         i. Phrases e.g. e .

        ii. Clauses e.g. , sed .

{ What about subordinating conjunctions, if they are used at all?
{ They do not combine "equivalent" elements.  Note that I say "if they
{ are used at all."  There might be some rethinking about the whole
{ matter of using clauses in Glosa.  Pidgins could provide some insight
{ here.

      J. Prepositions introduce phrases

{ Some phrases are introduced by prepositions, but some are not.  This
{ statement might erroneously imply that prepositions introduce all
{ phrases.

         i. Noun phrases e.g. de u .. .

        ii. Verb phrases e.g. vice akti .. .

{ In such a case, the verb would probably be functionally equivalent
{ to a gerund or substantival infinitive, in which case we are still
{ talking about a substantive phrase.

      K. Generic terms affixed with a hyphen alter lexical categories

         i. Single term affixed e.g. ergo-ka  (=work room)

        ii. Two or more terms affixed e.g. vora-ru-lo (cutlery drawer)

_____>>>  4. Concept clusters
              For the expression of complex concepts, two or more
               concept/words with equivalent function can be grouped -
               analogous to the forming of complex characters in
               Chinese through the combining of radicals.

{ Combining radicals is an aspect of -written- Chinese, not necessarily
{ the spoken language.  I suggest finding a different analogy.

      L. Equivalent concept/words functioning as substantives

         i. Separated words follow a determinant, with modifiers in an
             accompanying clause e.g. un elektro magneto dina; akti a latu, ..

        ii. Forming a super concept using slashes (/) to join words.

{ How, pray tell, do you speak a slash?  More attention needs to be
{ given to the spoken language and NOT to rely too much on written forms
{ which cannot be spoken (unless you want to adopt Lojbanesque spoken
{ punctuation).

       iii. Three or more grouped words can be bracketted, showing they
             are part of one compex entity, using `pipes' (|.... ....|

{ No.  This is only getting worse.

      M. Words of mixed function forming a single concept

         i. Concept/words and function words hyphenated e.g. mero-de-voka

        ii. Generic terms combined with concept/words e.g. plu akusti-pe

_____>>>  5. Verbs used to convey the equivalent of TO BE
               Many different relationships are conveyed
                using different concept/words and function
                words where they would all be conveyed
                using a form of 'to be'in English.

{ An example of each usage would be helpful.

      N. Being as nature

         i. Is in essence, has the same nature ( es )

        ii. Is equal to, measures ( eqa )

       iii. Has the property of, impersonal quality ( habe )

      O. Becomes - being as process

         i. Is becoming ( gene )

_____>>>  6. Verb Types   [i.e. concept/words functioning as verbs]
               Verbs have different functions depending on whether they
                can stand alone with noun phrases before and after them,
                whether they might take clauses rather than noun phrases,
                or if they are always intransitive.  Also there are verbs
                that qualify other verbs, and those that usually take
                complements to form compund verbs.

      P. Primary verbs that usually take take noun phrases before and after

         i. Verbs of action or affect that sometimes take a clause
             instead of one noun phrase e.g. bate

        ii. Verbs of abstraction and feeling that often take clauses
             before and after them e.g. kogita

      Q. Auxiliary verbs are verbs that usually modify primary verbs

         i. Those that always modify a primary verb, preceding it, but
             following adverbial modifiers e.g. an posi kursi ci

        ii. Those which can stand alone as a verb, but which are
             intransitive when they do so e.g.  Fe pote.  Fe pote akti id.

       iii. Those which when standing alone can take a direct object
              e.g.  Fe hedo id.  Fe hedo fago u vora.

{ In which case they are no longer auxiliaries.

      R. Verboids are words that usually take a complementary word after
          them to create a compound verb

{ Again, the whole notion is "verboid" is amorphous and ill-defined.  I
{ do not find a whole lot of clarification here.  Is the very notion of
{ "verboid" even necessary just because Hogben used the term?  What is
{ the difference between a "verboid" and an auxiliary?  I suggest
{ dropping the term "verboid" altogether.

         i. Verboids that usually take a function word as their complement,
             and are intransitive when used alone   e.g.   An pa ki.
                An pa ki ad an domi.  Fe fu ki ana u monta.

{ If a verboid can be used alone as sole verb, then why is it a verboid
{ rather than a verb?

        ii. Verboids that take noun complements, and are transitive
             when used alone  e.g. An dice u verba.  An pa dice qestio fe.

{ Again.

       iii. Verboids that take a modifier as their complement,and are
             transitive when used alone  e.g.  Geo akti gira id axi.
                Fe pa akti id.

_____>>>  7. Particles
               These are the function words placed at the start of
                Noun Phrases.  [These can be ommitted when the meaning
                is clear from context, but their inclusion is at the
                discretion of the speaker.]

{ "Particle" is used more generally in grammatical discussions than
{ as just markers at the head of noun phrases.

      S. Singular coultables

{ Countables

         i. A, the ( u ) [ u(n) before vowel ]     e.g. u bibli

{ NO!!!  It is a VERY BAD MISTAKE for Clark&Ashby to have rendered
{ 'u(n)' (and 'plu') as "a" and "the."  It is logical nonsense for
{ the same word to represent both indefinite and definite articles.
{ Describe it however you will, but scrap "a/the" as grossly misleading.
{ Glosa does not have articles.

        ii. One, one of ( uno )  e.g. uno-pe

      T. Measurables

         i. Some, a little of ( u pusi de )  e.g. Bibe u pusi de lakti.

        ii. Some of, a piece of  ( u mero de ) e.g.. Habe u mero de pomo.

      U. Plural countables

         i. The (plural), more than one  ( plu )  e.g. plu bibli

{ See above.

        ii. A number of, several  ( plura )      e.g. plura andra

_____>>>  8. Tense of verbs
               Nine short function words, used singly or in
                combination produce all necessary tenses.
                [Absence of a tense particle implies the simple
                present tense.]    A tense table is included in
                the examples.

{ THIS IS A TERRIBLE HASH!!!  It confuses tense, aspect, mood, and
{ voice in a hopeless hodge-podge mistakenly called "tense."  A lot of
{ the difficulty may arise from confusion with that mess called the
{ English verb system.  The English system is -such- a mess that Glosa
{ should -deliberately- avoid trying to mimic it.  The whole description
{ needs to be reworked and not called "tense" willy-nilly.  (Sorry for
{ the strong language, but I honestly do think that both the verb system
{ and its description really do need attention.)

      V. Tense particles

         i. Past events ( pa )

        ii. Future events ( fu )

       iii. Perfect past events ( pra )   [[Old Glosa]]

{ Junk it.  It is a confusion of past tense and perfective aspect.
{ There is no reason in the world why Glosa verbs have to mimic
{ the messiness of the English verb system.  Keep it clean and
{ simple.

        iv. Continuing events ( du )

{ Imperfective aspect, not a tense.  Glosa also needs a perfective
{ aspect particle.  'No-du' might work, although I am not too thrilled
{ by it.  Some auxlangs use an adverb roughly meaning "already" as a
{ quasi-imperfective particle.  Glosa has 'pre-nu' for "already," but
{ to me that seems to convey a bit too much of present time rather than
{ aspect.  However, I am not in favor of inventing a particle if that
{ can be avoided.

         v. Presently-occurring event ( nu )

        vi. Conditional event, would occur .. if ( sio )

{ Mood, not tense.

       vii. Desired event, ought to, or should occur ( debi )

{ Mood, not tense.

      viii. Execution of an event: passive voice ( gene )

{ As I read the documentation, passive voice is rendered 'es ge-X'.
{ This has been discussed before but not, as I recall, resolved.
{ I am not in favor of the redundant 'gene ge-X' as a standard passive
{ form.  And leave "got" out of the picture!  It is not even standard
{ throughout the English-speaking world, apparently.  Do not import
{ yet another mess into Glosa.

        ix. Verb as adjective: participle ( ge- ) e.g. u ge-akuto seka-ru

{ Actually a passive participle.

         x. Verb as noun: gerund [No particle; syntax indicates function.]

{ Here is one instance in which I think 'u(n)/plu' IS suitable.  In
{ my example in 1.B.ii.b (? the outline format is very difficult to
{ follow), I deliberately used 'per U vide' as "by sight," forming a
{ gerund or substantival infinitive by use of the substantive marker
{ 'u' with a word otherwise used as a verb.  (Some languages, such
{ as Interlingua, do not have a gerund form as such.)

      W. Reflexive forms, action affects the subject of the sentence

{ Example?  'Auto' and 'se' have never been well distinguished for me.
{ In some languages, reflexivity is a matter of voice, not tense.  I
{ heartily recommend scrapping the term "tense table" and replacing it
{ with something more like "verb forms."

_____>>>  9. Punctuation
               This indicates the clausal and phrasal structure
                in the written form.  [In uninflected language,
                this is a significant part of the grammar.]

{ Again, the whole issue of punctuation needs to be revisited.

      X. Internationally used forms

{ What is "international" about these usages?.  Some of them seem rather
{ idiosyncratic to Glosa to me.

         i. Separating phrases, if necessary, separating clauses joined
             with a conjunction, and at the conclusion of clauses ( , )

{ Unless, of course, a clause is at the end of a sentence.

        ii. Introducing adjectival clauses, placed before `qi' ( ; )

       iii. Introducing adverbial clauses, placed before `ke' ( : )

        iv. Listing clauses after a major clause ( Xx: xxxx; xxxx; xxxx. )

         v. Questions are terminated with a question mark ( ? )

        vi. Emphatic statements are terminated with an exclamation mark (!)

       vii. Direct speech is surrounded with quotation marks ( "Xxxxxx." )

      viii. Literary references marked with single quotes ( `xx xxx xx' )

        ix. Titles of books and documents marked with underlines ( _xxx_ )

{ Usually with italics in printed works.

         x. Statements in parenthesis either marked with commas or
             brackets ( , xxx,  OR  (xxx) )

{ Parenthetical statement are enclosed in parentheses; appositives
{ are set off by commas in English usage.

        xi. At the completion of a sentence (major clause) or to show
             an abbreviation that finishes on a letter other than the
             terminal one, a point is used ( .  OR  X. )

      Y. Further marking off of phrases, additional information,
          or asides in syntax-based grammar - to assist in the
          understanding of structure

         i. Additional information within a clause is separated off using
             dashes ( xxx - xxx xxxx - xx )

        ii. Additional information at the end of a sentence separated
             using a single dash ( xxx - xxxx xxx. )

{ For these two, some typographical conventions use a double hyphen or,
{ in printed matter, the em dash.

       iii. For emphasis, or to add contrasting information, within a
             sentence, three points are used for separation ( xxx ...
             xx xx ... xxxx )

{ Not good.  Three points usually indicate an ellipsis.

        iv. An alternative means of separating information, that is not
             part of the normal syntactic sentence, is the use of double
             points ( xx xxx .. xx xxx .. xxxx )

      Z. Non-literal language is marked using either one or two
          carats (^), which indicate the word used stylistically, or
          phrase that has been imported from a national language
          [This is especially relevant when the syntax-based
          language is being used as a `pivot' language for
          translation between national languages.]

{ Special written marking of figurative language seems to be a
{ Robingaskellism I have never encountered anywhere else.  Besides,
{ how do you speak a caret?  (A carat is a jeweler's unit weight of
{ 200 milligrams. :-) )  Skip any special marking.

         i. For simple word replacement, such as metaphor, a single
             carat is placed after the word used non-literally
             ( xxx xxxx^ xxxx )

{ Great care should be exercised when using metaphor and simile at all.

        ii. For idiom, carats before and after the usage - that is
             brought in from a national language - separate it, and mark
             it for special treatment ( xx xxx ^xxxx xx xxx^ xxx )

{ ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!  IDIOMS SHOULD BE AVOIDED ALTOGETHER, in which case
{ there is absolutely no need to mark them with punctuation.  I am not
{ the first to remark that idioms should be avoided in an auxlang like
{ the plague.
