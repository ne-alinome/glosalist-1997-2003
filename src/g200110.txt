I have several goals for my word list (which I will
describe more fully later). One of them is to avoid the
"accidental" multiple meanings inherited from the Romance
languages.

A perfect example is kanceri, for "crab" and "cancer". My
word list will NOT have one word mean both of those things.
(I'm leaning towards kanceri = crab, mali-amorfo =
cancer).

If I wanted a Romance IAL, I would choose LFN or Romanova.
One of Glosa's appeals (to me) is that it is slightly more
fair to non-Romance speakers.

Ok.

I've noted both meanings, but decided this word is too rare
to be in my core list.

My current thinking: decimali should not be a Glosa word,
since it really should be dekamali. So, instead, I have:
deka-sistema for the decimal system, and mero for a
fraction. There should also be terms for integer,
real/non-integer (floating point), etc.

Ok. It won't be in my word list, because it is a dupe of
duce.

Hmmmmm. But diskusi sounds like discussion, which would be
a more informal conference. But there is also diskursi
which means discussion. This one is still open for me.

I might be able to live with this having two meanings.

Here's my current version:
hedo;fun (feeling)
ludo;fun (play)

Again here I've noted both definitions, and also marked the
word as being too rare for my core list. They didn't have
planes, cars, or computers back then either, but our
language must adapt to the times.

Understood. However, as much as possible I want each Glosa
word to stand for one clear concept, not several concepts
that are related in one culture. I also want each concept
to be represented by only one core word, so translators
don't have to make ambiguous choices.

I already responded to the other person who replied.
Fortunately, there was a fair amount of agreement between
the two of you. My notes below cover areas that my earlier
response didn't.

My list has direkti as meaning "direction", which I took to
mean a compass point. Does it really mean to direct?

Still not sure here. I need to think more.

Very helpful.

Does fokali also refer to mental focus, or should it be
strictly physical? This is one where the abstract and
physical _seem_ closely aligned, although it may just be my
own cultural bias.

So should I just omit koncerne from my core list?

Ah. the british RAH-thur. I'll just leave that definition

I've included fuse (weld) and weld as defining words.

Ok. Lisi does not mean smooth.

Agreed. Rubi-xanto is the color.

I would use ~via~ for compass point direction.

Yes. They cover the same concept for me.

How about ~ikoni~, the Greek equivalent?

I would say that "focusing your mind" was a metaphor, 
and that "focusing your eyes, or your camera" was the
central concept here.

All the meanings seem to be covered. So it could be omitted .

Doesn't appear to me to be a core concept.

Thinking about this a bit more, I think only the melting
element of "weld" would be covered by ~liqi~. So I 
should consider using a "joining" word ~juga~, 
~konjuga~, ~konjunkti~, ~fusio~,  ~nexi~ or ~zigo~.

~fusio~ is combining by heating/melting so would be my 
choice.

Saluta,
Nick

    No.  Still attachments.  I admit I don't have any understanding 
of what the problem is, as I don't know what software you are using,
unless it is some sort of proprietary nonsense from America Online --
who, like Microsoft, seem to think that they are above such petty
things as industry- or internet-wide standards.  However, I have not
seen such a problem from other AOL users.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 7 Oct 2001 21:18:08 -0700 (PDT)

In putting together my own personal Glosa core words list,
I am changing the following:

akti-verbi -> akti-verba
deskribe-verbi -> deskribe-verba
nima-verba -> nomina-verba.

"verbi" is not a core word, but "verba" is. "nima" is not
core, but "nomina" is. One of my (many) goals is
consistency, so hyphenated core words can only consist of
other core words. I strongly recommend the keepers of the
GID to adapt this same policy.

I plan to leave "poli" out of my core list, since it is
redundant with "multi". Given that, and the above policy, I
will be changing:

poli-pe -> multi-pe

As always, comments are welcome.

Kevin

Mi du ergo de mi verba lista, e mi du habe multi questio.

As always, I would like to hear opinions from everyone on
these...

mite;send
How is this send different from bali?

morali;moral
Is this moral/good, or the concept of a moral which might
be relativistic? I assume the former (unfortunately) due to
the Western European culture, but want to be sure.

es la;exist
existe;exist
onto;exist
Is there any real difference between these? My current plan
is to remove "es la" and "onto", leaving just existe.

kontra;opposite
opositi;opposite
Is there any real difference between these? If not, I'll
probably leave out opositi and keep kontra.

petita;pet
Is this a noun or verb?

place;please
I plan to cast this as a request, and not tie it to the
concept of something being pleasing. I know that's where
the roots join, but I think they're separate concepts.

ponda;pound
Is this a pound of weight? If so, I'll drop it since we
have the metric system. Similarly if it's a pound of money
I'll drop it. I assume it's not the verb to pound.

primitive;primitive
I assume this refers to something being one-of-the-first.
Is it really different from proto? I'd like to drop it.

procesa;process
I assume this is both the noun (a method), and the verb (to
execute the method on something). 

promise;undertake
Most of the meanings of promise have to do with promises,
so this meaning doesn't make sense to me.

provide;foresee
Most of the meanings have to do with providing. How does
this relate to forseeing?

recepta;receipt
Is this the act of receiving? Or the piece of paper that
indicates it was received? It shouldn't mean both.

regula;principle
Most of the meanings have to do with regulating. Why is
principle here? It seems to be a side effect that regulate
-> rule (v) and rule (n) -> principle. I don't like it.

safe;manifest
I have no idea how this fits.

sensi;attitude
This meaning doesn't seem to belong

sibila;whistle, soothsay
Huh? I plan to make it whistle, and drop the soothsay
meaning.

sperma;pip
I thought a pip was a dot, like on a die. Sperma is seed.

Kevin

I prefer to think of it as a clarification project, rather
than a reform project. Sometime soon, I'll write up all my
goals so it will become more clear. The end product will be
a Kevin Core Glosa list that I can use for my own writing
purposes. If anyone else chooses to use it, that will be
fine with me, but it's not my motivation.

Whenever possible, I am staying within the GID, and
preferably the GID core. In a very few cases, I will be
including some words in my core which are not in the GID
core. An example would be that there is no word in core for
"sink (n)", which seems pretty core to me.

I doubt I will make up any new Glosa words. I think I can
fill out my core list with words from GID basic, or by
hyphenating core words.

For my own sanity, I am greatly enhancing the english word
mappings to the Glosa words. In some cases this means
clarifying which English meaning was intended. In some
cases, it means adding more English words within the same
concept, so I can more easily find the Glosa word I want.
In some cases, it is omitting English words which don't fit
the "one" concept of that Glosa word.

Also for my own sanity, I plan to eliminate most or all
Glosa synonyms. Each of my core words will represent a
single concept, and will be the ONLY core word to represent
that concept. I am also leaving GID core words out of my
list for a variety of other reasons, each of which I will
document.

Note that I am not eliminating any words from Glosa. I am
merely creating a subset list that people can choose to use
if they wish--if they agree with my choices. I believe the
loose vocabulary of Glosa is its weakest point right now,
and this is my own personal solution.

As I said, it's mostly so I can create my own tool, and all
my aims and goals will be spelled out when I post the
list(s) on my website.

Thanks for asking :-)

Kevin

There is a (draft) list of those synonyms on 
     http://www.glosa.org/gid/cosyn.htm . 

The Glosa authors certainly prefered "poli".  It can be found more 
often in their publications.

Interesting. On the positive side, "poli" seems to be more
Greek, and since Glosa hinges on Greek, I tend to favor
Greek roots when there's a choice.

However, my big concern about "poli" is confusion with
unrelated words like "polica", "polisi", and "politika". I
believe this confusion comes from the other Greek root of
Pol, roughly meaning person.

I do feel, somewhat strongly, that only one of the two
should be in any core list. At this point, I guess I still
lean towards keeping "multi" because it is more distinct.

Kevin

I have posted a somewhat lengthy description of the goals

This document, as well as the list itself, is a work in
progress.

I am especially interested to hear from Robin, Charles, and

interested to hear feedback from pan glosa-pe.

Thanks,

Yes. I think you are right about ~verba~.

The more usual Glosa terms are
~klavi-verba~
~qualita-verba~
~nomina-verba~

~Poli~ is certainly the preferred form.

But neither of those are GID core (or basic). Akti-verbi
and deskribe-verbi are.

Klavi-verba doesn't make sense to me..."closed word"? "key
word"? I also think "describing word" is somewhat better
than "quality word".

Same meaning in Glosa. One word is Latin and the other Greek.
I would prefer ~bali~.

~morali~ is from ~more~ [custom]. So it's what's good
for you in your society/period of history.

No difference. I prefer ~existe~.

No difference. I would say ~anti~ also covers this meaning.

Noun. I would use ~domi-zoa~.

~place~ seems only to be used as polite request marker.

~petitio~ ask/request.
~gluko~ pleasing/nice/comfortable.
~sukro~ sweet tasting.

Money.

Yes. I'd prefer ~proto~ too.

Seems likely.

"undertake" can be "pledge to do something".

Literal meaning. ~pro-vide~ seeing ahead. ~pro-~ = forward, is
an official "useful prefix", but I don't think they fit well into Glosa.

~cepti~ is act of receiving.

~regula~ is rule/principle.
"regulate"/"control" should be ~krati~.

An "attitude" is a general feeling about something.

Latin sibilare, to hiss and Greek sybil "prophetess".
Can't have both words in Glosa.

Apple, orange and pear (etc) seeds are called pips.

True. But that could be a mistake!

Key. The most important word in the sentence, and so
the key to its meaning.

That people's tastes differ, is one of the reasons that
Glosa has so many exact synonyms. The other reasons
being Greek and Latin sources, and the problem of having
to keep using the same words over and over when 
writing. The extra words don't  put a great strain
on the memory, as we all recognise many more words than 
we use. It seems that's the way memory works.

Poli saluta,

Ah, but I don't think the concept of "key" as in unlocking
something (klavi) is really the same as "key" as in
important. So if you really mean the most important word,
it should be something like gravi-verba.

If you mean the word that unlocks the meaning of the
sentence, then klavi-verba would make sense. But that still
seems like a stretch to me.

Also, I'm not sure the noun really is the most important.
Some sentences don't have nouns, or only have objects and
not subjects. The distinction (to me) is still that a noun
names or identifies something. I guess idio-verba would
work for me, too.

But at this point, rather than trying to figure out a
better word for it, I'm inclined to go with the (corrected)
GID core word for noun: nomina-verba.

True within reason. But I still want a core list that has
one word per meaning. Even if it's not my favorite.

Thanks for your input on this. I'm enjoying the discussion.

Makes sense. I trust that although the roots are similar,
that the words "more" (custom) and "morali" (morality)
should remain distinct concepts. I suppose "ne-morali"
would be amoral, and "no-morali" would be immoral.

I wondered about that. Thinking further, "kontra" has
unfortunate similarity to "ko", given its opposite meaning.
My only concern about "anti" is that it has connotations of
hostility, whereas the others seem to be passive (or
objective?) states of opposite-ness. Perhaps "opositi" is
the right choice.

Hmmm. To me, undertake is to actually begin to do
something. It goes well beyond a mere promise. I'll ponder
this more.

Then I suspect I'll drop this meaning.

So "recepta" would be the confirming document. I'm not
thrilled that gluing "re" on the front turns it into a
document. But unless there's a cool hyphenated word that
means receive-confirm-document I'll probably leave it.

Interesting. "Krati" currently seems to have strong
government overtones. We also have "sistema" for
organization. More thought required.

Ok, manifest (adj - obvious), as opposed to manifest (v
-cause), or manifest (n - list of contents). Sounds like a
job for "klari".

Which really has little to do with the core concept of
sensing and perceiving (in my mind, at least). It's closer
to a belief ("kredi") or opinion ("doxo"). Not to mention
"mode" which currently lists attitude as a meaning.

Right, and since whistles are much more common today than
soothseers (or prophets), I'm inclined to stick with
whistle. Unless there's a great Greek word for whistle we
could use...

Itera grati!

Via is road/path/street, so I can't see also using it for a
compass direction. If I could find the word for
orientation, I would see that as also being a compass
direction. Any ideas?

[ GID says: 
[ bali - cast (throw); fling; hurl; post (mail); send; throw;  
[          toss 
[ mite - send; transmit 

mite is from Latin mitto - to send, to throw. 
  Latin learners know the sentence a lot of chapters of Caesar's 
  "Bellum Gallicum" start with:  "Quibus rebus ductis legatos mittunt."
  (After this they sent diplomats.) 

ballo is from Greek ballo - to throw.
  (ballistics, ball, 
  devil=dia-bol-os= one throwing things into confusion). 

I think, we can use bali and mite as synonyms, but I would like 
the distinction to be perMITTEd 
  bali - (mainly) to throw; 
         to send (object is a thing that cannot move on its own) 
  mite - (mainly) to send (object is a person or a thing, delivered 
         by a person)

... and keep both in Core.  If only one, then bali is prefereable.

I should have explained that ~klavi-verba~ is Glosa for
"verb".

Yes. You are right - key doesn't equal important. And
actually ~klavi~ used as a verb would be "to lock", so 
even "unlocking the meaning"  cannot be the idea.

I've often thought about what the "true essence" of Glosa
(or Interglossa) really might be, and attempted some "reform"
projects on a small test scale.

Hogben wanted to use Greek and scientific international roots.
I suppose this could be accomplished, but there are not many
such roots, and the vocabulary would be inadequate without
a more powerful derivational system than simple compounding.
Ron/Wendy used Latin/Romance to fill out the vocab in a highly
inconsistent manner. Unfortunately, so many roots conflict in
meaning between Latin and Greek that the result is confusion.

So, Glosa enthusiasts have been trying to clean up the vocab.
But without clear agreed principles, and lacking a charismatic
leader or significant financial investment, ...

POLI and PLU are both from the Greek POLY; MULTI is Latin.
A definitive list of all the articles/determiners is needed
before attempting to reform any one, because they form an
interdependent set. In fact, they are among the 100 or so
crucially important words of an "analytic" language. A true
vocab reform would gather the entire set of functional words
(particles) into a rational paradigm, and review them for
completeness and efficiency in actual use.

The "semantic" (rather than "grammatical") words are another
issue, and should be kept separate. Ron/Wendy did try to
categorize words, and I think their effort should be updated.
My own esthetic ideal would be to make the primary separation
obvious by reserving one-syllable words for particles and
doubles for semantic words, but that may not be achievable.

The Latin/Romance word for dance conflicts with the Greek for throw.
Using "ject = throw", we get many more unambiguous derivatives.
For a minimal core vocabulary, "bal" and such are too troublesome.

I'm thinking that a purely apriori vocab would be preferable
to a mangled naturalistic one such as Glosa and Esperanto.

But better still would be a careful selection of the most useful
non-ambiguous roots from Latin (and latinized Greek) without the
mangling, so that Europeans do get a head-start but for others
the roots are no worse than pure apriori (in other words,
avoid importing the many european irregularities).

Those unfamiliar with Lojban/Loglan should also examine the
list of "gismu" for hints as to core vocabulary selection:

Good point. Do you think the Latin-derived words could be
removed from Glosa and so rely only on Greek? That would be
more esthetically pleasing to me than the current mixture,
e.g. both Latin "script" and Greek "graph" for English "write".

God knows if the Greek words aren't more unaltered than the Latin ones,
considering that we don't have to ponder about how they are in modern Greek.
But my knowledge of Greek or indeed Glosa is to small to permit me to do any
suggestions there. What one doesn't know one can look up in a dictionary of
scientific words. Like:
I don't pretend the following is Glosa. I just am imagining. Approximatly
something like this: "U antropo graph pro philos. > U antropo graf pro
filos. Ego xene en ti polis."

*  Friends, 

     For my part, I use ~nima-verbi~ to cover the NOUN concept, and 

             ~akti-verbi~ for the VERB idea.


     While the VERB might be the 'key word' in a sentence, defining the action, I am quite against the unnecessary use of metaphors in Glosa.


     This >concept-word<< element of Glosa's specification has the potential of being its most powerful feature, but, sadly, because we are all human .. and not analytical machines .. it could be Glosa's major downfall.  

     When my brother rattles off Esperanto at me, challenging me to reply in equivalent manner using Glosa, I cringe inwardly.  Esperanto is comfortable, and more or less translates into idiomatic form - as applies in most national languages.  But Glosa, because it holds out for ACTUAL meanings, not idioms and not metphors, works in a way that humans have not yet been taught to think.


     In old-world thinking, speaking .. by copying others .. is the natural thing to do, and has worked - up to now.

     Perhaps, in some future civilisation, people will learn to think first, then speak later: while for us - with our chilhood conditioning of using metaphors, cliches and idioms most of the time - speaking in Glosa can be painful, once we learn to *think in Glosa* the process of expressing ourselves using Glosa will become more automatic.


     Can we wait for civilisation to catch up with Glosa?


     On the base level of the lexicon, I would say the 'keys' and 'keyness' should be restricted to matters of opening and closing, and permissions to to enter.  Is a computer "key" something that gives you the 'permission to enter' a letter symbol?  Did John 'key' his letter into the computer, or did he 'press' it in?


   ~Jon pa kalvi in an grama, uti puta-me.~     [using the phrasal verb]

 ~Jon pa klavi an grama in u puta-me.~  [flows better & is better(?) Glosa]


         OR


  ~Jon pa presu an grama in u puta-me.~


         OR       


  ~Jon pa digita an grama in u puta-me.~


     Was it "fingered" or was it "pushed"?


     Ron Clark used to say "Play with the language."  My suspicion is that the Glosa-pe are not being 'playful' enough.


     The Golden Rule for Glosa seems to be: in seeking the answer to the question, #What am I really trying to say#?


     Do I seek the word that embodies the 'action' or the one that is the 'key' to the whole sentence.  Maybe this is too philosophical, or maybe, our old friend William of Occam can come to our assistance here.

     Cutting through to the essence of the concept, I would suggest most people would agree that 'action' is the keynote to the VERB concept, so ~akti-verbi~ could trigger the right associations in the minds of the majority of people.


     Similar reasoning would lead through NOUNS as 'names' to ~nima-verbi.~


     Of course, if we can get away with thinking words are labels, then we might seek the label that in the shortest number of letters, and with the simplest conceptual structure .. as well as being meaningful to the greatest number of people .. seems O.K.


     It is a bit of a juggle, three balls are in the air: wordshape, thought patterns and statistics.  Will the balls fall and make a mess of language, or will skillful communicators catch them all neatly - each time - to produce a string of serendipitous words?


Keep juggling,


Saluta,

  Robin

Robin was discussing the question how to make it easier to speak Glosa. I think this is a matter of practice. I cannot imagine that Glosa should be so much more alien than many other languages, it is just the pedagogic method that is not good enough. People can learn to speak Latin. You begin with simple things like "Nauta sum", and then you go on building it up: Nauta suecicus
sum. In urbo habito...." And then you go on, learning more and more. Problem with Glosa is that you need a lot of motivation. And then one has to get over ones prejudices about the language....

Ethnic languages just are there, and there is nothing for you to change or to have an opinion about. With - say - English you cannot just starting reforming it if you stumble on something that you don't understand, if you see my point. And this is just what often will happen, when people learn an auxiliary language. They stop for good, or they start reforming it. But a few of the
learners struggle on and learn.

Yes, with reservations about the Latin/Greek part. More on

I certainly can't answer that, but would definitely like to
see Greek roots as "strongly preferred". Someone said there
aren't enough Greek roots to cover all the meanings we
need, so Latin seems like the right choice to fill in the
gaps.

I would also like to see more hyphenated words, and fewer
imported long words (as I mentioned in my word list
rationale document).

I'm not fluent enough with Glosa yet to be able to agree or
disagree. When translating, I do find myself constantly
trying to burrow through my idiomatic English to find out
what the heck I'm REALLY trying to say. 

However, when I'm on a roll, and am creating original
material directly in Glosa, the thought process doesn't
seem that radical to me.

If you are correct about thought patterns, then Glosa would
work relatively better for written communication, because
you have time to think it through, and can go back and
revise it.

Excellent question. Somehow the word for a a physical key
got recycled into a piano key, and then a computer keyboard
key. Even if we "press", or "finger" something in, we still
need a word for those little bits of plastic we're hitting.

Perhaps something like litera-butona, or litera-ru. (By the
way, I'm using litera because grama (I thought) meant the
kind of letter you would drop in a mailbox, and not a
single alphabetic character). Assuming this is the case, I
plan to promote litera from basic up to core in my own
lists.

Excellent point.

My own approach to Glosa follows my approach to writing
computer programs, which is closely aligned with "Extreme
Programming", or XP. It is highly iterative, where you get
a skeletal version of something out there quickly (and with
high quality within the parts you release), and rely on
feedback to direct future development.

So for Glosa, I'm perfectly willing to accept the existing
core as a starting point. It's "good enough" for me...sort
of. I want to fix what I see as the errors (e.g. nima-verbi
-> nomina-verba), and strip out any parts that don't seem
consistent (high quality).

>From that starting point, I hope the language can grow
incrementally and organically. Individuals will, in their
own writing, coin new words. Glosa-pe will either accept
and adopt those words, or will reject them (implicitly, by
not using them). The language will grow and evolve
organically.

Assuming this organic growth is possible, I don't want to
do a lot of reform up front. I won't worry too much about
whether the core represents exactly the right set of
concepts or not, or whether this particular Latin root
might be better than that Greek one. Those issues can
resolve themselves in the long run.

For now, I want to get Glosa to a point where is is usable,
and then use it. And I want as many people as possible to
start using it, because that's the ONLY way we'll know if
it's a viable IAL or not. In my mind, most reform projects
are doomed because they are too dramatic, when incremental
would be more effective.

If we don't have a small community of people communicating
regularly in Glosa within a few months (?), I will most
likely lose interest and move on to some other IAL. Glosa
is my first choice, because of its unique syntax. But I'm
not here for a pure hobby. I want something that will
actually generate results in the world.

Glosa doesn't have to be the most popular IAL for me to be
happy. It just needs to be used for actual communcation by
a growing community of people.

Hmmm. It seems to me that "throw" and "send" really are
different concepts. However, rather than the distinction
you suggest, I would propose that bali would be to
physically toss or throw something. Mite would be to send
or transmit something. So:

Mi pa bali u paketa trans u kamera; a me fe-sibi
Mi pa mite u paketa trans u urba; a mi fe-sibi.

Mi pa bali u bola a Jo.
Mi pa mite u nota a Jo.

I wrote this in my own auxiliary idiolect in order to show what I wanted
to say rather than describing it in abstract forms that I am not capable
of getting across in English, I'm afraid. So I beg your pardon for not
having written in Glosa, as I know I should.

What you do when you learn a language is that you train your brain to go
from machine code to a speak and write program. So when you are trying to
translate back and forth between Glosa and English you're just stopping
yourself. When I am trying to write something in English I most certainly
don't translate it into English from Swedish, I just write it, because I
have the thoughts there and I try to express them. I may need a word and
then I look it up. The thought may be there, but it has a Swedish word
for it, provided I cannot find the English one. It is somewhat like a
multilingual wordprocessor I have. When I try to use its foreign language
fonts on my Swedish keyboard it shows the "international" letters and
substitutes the typically Swedish ones with, say, Russian! I think that
is how our brains work, as well.

So when we learn a language we should train our brains much as we do when
training a dog. We teach them to behave.

As the Glosa promotors have not thought about a didactic way of teaching
the language, I think we ourselves have to find the method.

But Glosa has the problem as any auxiliary language will have. The
learner will question whether the language is good or not.

For your amusement I could tell you a little story from my school time.
My English teacher told me that English was a world language. And I asked
her why then it had such a crazy spelling, you couldn't learn it. German
was plain and simple in comparison. Whereon she replied that "English is
nothing like these stupid language Ido or Esperanto...." (As a matter of
fact I was learning Esperanto at the time and found that much easier than
English).

I should - in order to avoiding misunderstandings - point out that I am
not, nowadays, a proponent of Esperanto. It doesn't answer my criteria
for an auxiliary language. So I am not secretly propagating it.

Provided that the inventors of Glosa really can speak it fluently, even
others must be able to do so.

Any language will generalize where other languages particularize. You can
select _clav, tast, tangent_ for the key that you press. An English-Greek
vocabulary would give inspiration I think.

Isn't _grama_ the product of something _"graf"-ed_? We have _phonogram_ a
_phonograph_ was a machine as it were "writing sounds". Then an e-mail
could be an "elektronografie" or "elektronogram" (made into Glosa
according to the rules necessary). The parts of those words do exist in
all European languages, as far as I know, even in Finnish. (Icelandic
being the sole possible exception). On the other hand an Icelandic
learner has studied English and has therefore learnt the International
vocabulary and has been taught what the international morphemes mean. So
international Greek might well be a mor concrete thing to him than it is
to us.

Right. However, I currently use Glosa in three distinct
ways:
1. Reading what others have written
2. Translating my existing English web pages into Glosa
3. Writing new material directly in Glosa (which I
sometimes later translate into English, but often do not)

When doing #2, it it challenging for me to figure out my
own idioms.

Am I to understand that as:

John lettered in a computer.

> Jon pa grama per puta-me. [John wrote-his-letter by-means-of (on) a

John lettered by a (via) a computer (the computer)

> Jon pa puta-me an grama. [John used-a-computer-to-bring-into-existence his
> letter.]

John computered his letter.

Is _an_ a possessive, like _his_?

If so this is a typical English usage. We had to learn that particularly that
when we waved the hand, put the money in the pocket and when he sent the
letter then the English would wave their hands, put their money in their
pockets, and they would send their letters!

The use of posessives is slowly creeping into Swedish as people read so much
English over here.

A funny thing is that we can say: "They shook on the head!" when English
speakers would say "They shook their heads!"

So as you can imagine I don't give much for Whorfff or what his name was...

Exactly.

An means he, him, or his, depending on its position. 

An du sedi. He is sitting.
An feli du sedi. His cat is sitting.
Mi pa sedi epi an. I sat on him.

Did I miss any?

How does Swedish handle the posessive case without
posessives? Just curious.

> A funny thing is that we can say: "They shook on the

heads!"

In Glosa, I would probably say:

Mu pa osci mu kefa. They shook their heads.

This would be legal, but doesn't make as much sense to me:

Mu kefa pa ge-osci. Their heads shook (got shaken).

The latter sounds more like someone riding a roller
coaster.

Of course, shaking heads is a cultural thing. I worked with
some folks from India who nodded "yes" by rocking their
head side-to-side (moving each ear toward the closest
shoulder). It took me a while to distinguish this motion
from the US gesture for "no" which is swiveling the face
back and forth, keeping the nose level.

So one of these would be clearer:

Mu pa indika "ne" per osci mu kefa.
Mu pa indika "ja" per osci mu kefa.
Mu pa indika "no-lauda" per osci mu kefa.

Yes. ~Litera~ is letter (A.B.C.) and ~gram~ is letter (post/mail).

~Ru~ (tool) seems to grand a term for a computer keyboard key.
How about ~digi-ra~, which parallels ~manu-ra~ (a handle)?

So posta would be the mail system, and grama would be a
mail item. We also have nota, which would serve for letter.
Do we really need all these terms? If so, what are the
distinctions? 

I think grama is already too close to other meanings--after
all, Glosa has gram for weight and gramatika for grammar.
Thus, I suggest:

posta = mail (collective), mail (v), mail (system)
posta-ra = individual mail item of any kind--letter,
parcel, postcard, etc.
nota = note, letter (mail)
litera = letter (a,b,c)
grama gets dropped out of core
grama-ve becomes posta-ve = envelope

Tools can be pretty simple, so I don't mind ru...

> How about ~digi-ra~, which parallels ~manu-ra~ (a
handle)?

This also sounds fine to me. I assume this would be any
kind of button or finger-lever. It could be confused with
thimble, ring, or false fingernail, but I can live with
that.

But a keyboard becomes digi-ra-fa, which sounds a bit odd.
Maybe digi-ra-mensa or digi-ra-taba? Or in-digi-ra
(input-finger-thing)? Of those, I like digi-ra-fa best,
even though it is strange.

Yes, but kratera is any bowl or basin. Over here on the
west US coast, we rarely call it a basin or wash basin.
It's a sink (especially in the kitchen). So it took me a
while to even make the connection to kratera.

Mi du uti u kratera pro vora mo.
Mi du uti u lava-kratera pro lava.

On a related topic, I'm guessing that lava-ka would be best
for loo/washroom/bathroom/water closet/head, but I'm still
trying to figure out the word for toilet. The best I have
thought of so far is merda-ru.

    If you think that you cannot express yourself adequately in Glosa

standard auxiliary, such as Occidental or Interlingua (as long as you
are discussing Glosa), rather than some idiosyncratic, nonstandard

~Nota~ seems to mean peice of paper with writing/printing on it.
So "bill" (money and restuarant check), "notice" (poster/sign/ad),
or written "record" of an event. A letter would fit into this category.

~Posta~ would seem to be letters in transit or at the start or end of their
journey.

Yes. Makes sense, if ~nota~ is not too general a term.

Thimble = ~alexi-digi~
Ring = ~zona~
False fingernail = ~falsi ungu~

Yes. I prefer ~digi-ra-fa~ too.

I don't see why it would be better. As long as it is understood as it is
intended. (My attempted glosaization might show whether that is the case).
I'm rather fond of Kjell's auxiliary idiolect, myself.

Yes, ~lava-ka~ is the preferred term for the room. The is also
~balno-ka~ for the room with a bath in it. And I would guess
~duca-ka~ for the room for the shower. ~Kloseta~ is the word
for the toilet itself.

But balno is not even GID basic, and lava includes "bath"
and "bathe" in its meanings.

Duca isn't in GID at all. I suppose pluvi would double as
both an outdoor rain shower, and a personal washing shower?
(Of course, pluvi is not to be confused with plu-vi!
Yikes).

> ~Kloseta~ is the word for the toilet itself.

Again, not even GID basic. And too close to the English
"closet" for my tastes.

I (for one) do not oppose anyone using whatever idiom they please.
But advocacy for competing IALs would be extremely rude.

As my auxiliary idiolect indeed just exists in my head I used it just in
order not to be suspected of advocating some other IAL. And if it was
understandable it saved me a lot of brainwork as compared to writing in
English.

I understood your statement above, though I read it at approx
half-speed compared to English. This is all that can be expected
of an auxiliary language. I have had enough experience in a very
similar dialect (Occidental) to be convinced of this, but:

The one great potential strength I imagine in Glosa is that
it would permit a simple and direct one-to-one translation of
morphemes. This is due to its "analytical syntax-based grammar".
In particular, it should be easy to go from Chinese or English
to Glosa, using only a 2000 (or so) word list. A web interface
can make this less painful -- e.g., my old experimental page:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/dict.cgi

It seems that most adults cannot learn an inflectional language,
so Esperanto by its basic design is absolutely impossible as an IAL.
Glosa removes almost all the morphology and approximates a pidgin,
which is the precisely correct typology for an adult 2nd language.

Edgar De Wahl designed Occidental to be easily "evolve-able"
in the analytic direction. Its verbal system is similar to Glosa
in relying on pre-postioned auxiliaries. A similar pattern formed
the basis of the Lingua Franca. But EDW was unable to solve the
problem of derivation *without* suffixes. I don't think Glosa
has succeeded there (derivation) either.

True, but they are noted with (1) and (G) respectively, in
the GID word list. For better or worse, I'm treating the
GID core (++) and GID basic (+) as being the most
up-to-date official sources, and neither of those made the
cut, for whatever reason.

As always, I'm not trying to dictate what is "correct"
Glosa, but rather am trying to find a solid and adequate
subset that I can use reliably.

Balno wouldn't bother me, other than having some
overlapping meaning with lava.

I don't like soma-va at all. It seems more like a coffin,
or perhaps a sleeping bag. Too vague.

Mi pa puta de plu-ci verba: anti, kontra, no, e opositi.
Pan-ci du 
semani pene iso de alelo. 

Mi nuli-kron amo 'no', kausa id es plus proxi a 'ne'. U GID
du 
ero inter 'no' e 'ne', mi kredi:

ne foto: Posi debi no-foto

no-dina: Debi ne-dina
no-funktio: Debi ne-funktio
no-kine: Debi ne-kine
no-profunda: Probabili debi ne-profunda
no-resista: Debi ne-resista
no-sati: In plu kaso, debi ne-sati
no-semani: In plu kaso, debi ne-semani
no-soni: Debi ne-soni
no-stimula: Debi ne-stimula
no-sura: Posi debi ne-sura
no-vide: Debi ne-vide

Tende evita konfusi, mi du tende uti 'anti-' vice 'no-'. Id
du 
es mega klari, e radi de Greek.

'Kontra' du es ne-boni, kausa id du es homo de 'ko'.
'Opositi' es 
meso-boni-mali, sed id ne du habe uno profito vice 'anti'.

Ko-co, mi du skema; fu apo 'kontra', 'no', 'non', e
'opositi' de

Akorda a GID, 'fosi' du semani ~dig~ alo ~pour~. Sed plu-la

~Dig~ posi es 'spata', alo 'uti spata', alo 'spata-akti'.

Kausa ~fossil~ du es kognati a ~dig~ in Latin, mi sio
ma-amo; fosi du semani ~dig~. Qe, u-ci du boni semani?

Kevin

===
According to GID, 'fosi' means dig or pour. But those
meanings are dissimilar. Which meaning should remain, and
which should change?

Dig could be 'spata', or 'uti spata', or 'spata-akti'.
Pour could be 'lase flu', or 'sti flu'.

Because fossil is related to dig in Latin, I would prefer
that 'fosi' means dig. Does this make sense?

    When I compiled the original Glosa Basic Reference which I
put up on the www with Clark&Ashby's permission, following some
correspondence, the intention was to distinguish between
opposition and simple negation.  They are not the same thing,
and some languages (nat and con) do not always distinguish them
well.  'ne' was for simple negation and 'no-' for opposition.

Clearly. However, I believe in several cases (see my
earlier email), the wrong one was chosen. 

Perhaps the most clear case, in my mind, is 'no-kine'
(motionless). It's not the opposite of motion; rather, it's
a lack of motion. Therefore, it should be 'ne-', and not
'no-'. 

The others range from obviously (to me) incorrect, to
arguably incorrect, to those which could reasonably be
'ne-' or 'no-', depending on the intended meaning.

This confusion seems to be due to a typo in one 
of the sources documents for the GID.
~Fosi~ is to dig, and ~fusi~ is to pour.

From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>
Date: Thu, 18 Oct 2001 12:35:00 +0200

Karo Kevin e plu hetero pe, 

I am glad about Kevin's activities to make a new Core dictionary! 
The discussion in Glosalist he has stimulated and the contributions of 
Nick and others are very interesting!  This all should be evaluated 
and the results should be built into the GID. 

You may know, that I once made a list of "Similar Synonyms".  It has 
about 400 items.  I have sent it to Wendy Ashby and got suggestions 
from her, which words are prefereable and which should be eliminated. 

This list must be built into the GID necessarily, too.  (If not, IMO 
Glosa has disqualified itself from beeing a serious attempt for an 
IAL.)  Unfortunately this is a very tedious work, that needs a bit 
concentration.  So I am very slow with it.  When it will be ready, it 
will have changed also the Core-dictionary of today. 

Because I do not want to hinder Kevin's work with my slowness, 
or that our parallel working results in bad contradictions and 
disappointment, I decided to update the GID as far as it is now 
  ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/index.html , hope, files are ok.).

The "Similar Synonyms"-list is on 
  http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm . 
New: now there are also Wendy's suggestions written, as far as they 
are considered, and the changes to the GID they caused. 

Wendy's suggestions are on 14 pages, 4 of them are considered.  The 
other 10 are scanned now and are temporarily on a website.  Links to 
these GIF-files (about 70 kB each) are also in the simsyn.htm ! 

Everybody, who wants to play with the Glosa words, may visit the 
simsyn.htm file, please. 

Saluta - Marcel

Hi Syd,
Actually now there's little attachments
that get added to an HTML message
from you.

A service that I've used recently
is very neat, you can read and
answer your mail from any
web-connected computer.

http://www.mail2web.com/

I'm not sure if it will work with
AOL but it's easy to use whenever
I want to check email from another
computer other than mine and maintain
privacy and security.

Hope that helps,
Jay B.

Subject: [glosalist] More word list work
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2001 09:08:31 -0700 (PDT)

While shifting several no-xxx to be ne-xxx, I came across
'no-semani' (meaningless). This seems to confuse two or
three definitions of the English word 'meaning':
1) dictionary meaning
2) philosophical purpose
3) conceptual consistency

Thus, I propose that nonsense, senseless, and meaningless
would more accurately be captured by 'ne-logika'
(illogical).

---

The recent GID changes (thanks!) did include some
unfortunate choices. The one that really jumped out at me
is: 'manu-pe' (manager). This arises from the confusion
between two meanings of handle:
1) physically manipulate something (with your hands)
2) manage, take care of, control

The two meanings are not closely related, and should not be
covered by the same Glosa word.

To me, 'manu-pe' sounds like a hand-model (someone who is
paid to photograph their hands for advertisements). I
definitely won't use this to mean manager. 

Management is different from leadership ('duce'). It's more
related to control. So perhaps 'regula-pe' would be
reasonable for manager.

---

'Tekno' has bothered me for a while. It covers both
technology, and skill/cleverness. And, if you include
'no-tekno' (clumsy) it also seems to cover physical
dexterity. I believe its meaning should be limited to
technology.

So we need other words for cleverness. Possible candidates:
'intelige', 'strategi'. Or perhaps 'vafro' from the basic
list. Or maybe 'versuto'? Are there others?

We also need physical dexterity. Probably 'agili' from the
basic list?

'Dina' means both power (n), and compel (v). To me, these
are quite different, and should not be covered by the same
word.

Since dynamic, dynamo, and dynamite all refer to the power
(n) meaning, it seems like that's the one that should stay.

So we need a word for compel, coerce, oblige, force (v),
enforce. We have 'koerce' (coerce) in the basic list, or
'domina' (dominate). Or perhaps 'uti-dina' (use force). I
think 'koerce' is the best fit.

Seeing her original text is quite helpful. Whether I agree
with her or not, it gives me more insight into the
intentions and process.

I'm not quite sure what you mean by this. I guess you mean
that the results need to be integrated into the GID, which
I agree with.

Thank you very much for this. My list has taken an
interesting journey, and it has a ways to go. I started
with the Glosa Basic Reference (GBR), not realizing that
GID core would have been a better starting point.

After working with that list some, I went through and
compared every word with GID core, adding GID words, and
noting words that were non-core. I have been working with
my list for quite a while, and will continue to do so. Of
course, I'll use the updated GID now that it is available.

I will probably publish an interim version of my list soon,
in case anyone wants to see the work in progress.

Later, I'll make another complete pass of comparing my list
with GID core, making sure I didn't miss anything, and
seeing how much I have really changed. At that point, I
might decide to publish my work as a list of changes from
GID-core, but I suspect not (because it would be quite
difficult).

It is a lot of work, but it is generally fun and rewarding.
Of course, one of my goals is to shrink the core list,
which means someone who works with core in the future will
have a smaller job.

Kevin

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2001 11:52:30 -0700 (PDT)

I'm a bit confused by the recent synonym changes to deko
and gru.

First, 'decent' was removed. I can see 'descent' being
removed, but to me 'decent' fits right in with 'seemly' and
'proper'.

Second, I'm trying to distinguish between 'deko' and 'gru'.
To me, 'deko' is related to decorum--a values judgement on
proper-ness and suitability. Contrast that with 'gru',
which to me is a physical or logical (objective) concept of
suitability.

Does that sound reasonable, or am I missing something?

Kevin

I'm trying not to ask questions here that can be answered
using Wendy's notes. [Note, however, that I can't actually
read the GIF files on my computer/browser. I'll try it on
my wife's machine.]

I assume 'organi' is like a bodypart organ, and not like a
musical organ?

I suspect 'radi' should just mean the root of a plant. We
have 'basi' as a conceptual root of something (plus 'origi'
for an origin). Perhaps radi isn't needed in core at all?

Is 'relatio' the generic word for any kind of relation,
relationship, or relative?

Does 'spaci' mean outer space (as opposed to vacant space)?

'Spekula' is listed for both mirror and speculate. Mirror
should probably be something like 'reflekti-ra' (promoting
'reflekti' from basic to core). 

Speculate could then remain 'spekula', except that it seems
reasonably close to 'divina'. Is there a significant
difference in meanings between 'divina' and 'spekula'?

Subject: [glosalist] Ceiling and floor
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2001 20:16:26 -0700 (PDT)

Although they seem like pretty fundamental concepts, GID
core/basic doesn't really do well with either floor or
ceiling.

Floor is 'pedi-lo' (foot-place). While this does work, it
seems pretty vague and cumbersome for something so basic.
I'm trying to find a word for platform (other than the
obviously imported "plataforma'). 
I had hoped to construct 'raised-floor', but 'leva-pedi-lo'
could be either 'raised-foot place', or 'raised
foot-place'. I suppose it could be 'leva pedi-lo', but I
would like to use a fully-hyphenated word, since it's a
complete concept.

Meanwhile, our word for ceiling ('tegu') is also lid or
cover. This leads to the extremely odd and jarring 'pedi-lo
tegu' (literally foot-place cover, but which could be seen
as 'foot-place ceiling') for carpet or rug. 

At a minimum, I would suggest using '-te' for carpets and
rugs...pedi-lo-te if we're stuck with 'pedi-lo'.

And I think the concept of ceiling is important enough to
warrant its own core word, apart from lid or roof.
Hmmm..perhaps 'sub-stego' or 'intra-stego' would be good
enough. I'd sure like something better.

Kevin

Many have said that the Glosa vocab needs some revision.
What criteria besides personal preference can be invoked?
Without a system, it remains as disorganized as it began.
Reliance on a user community evolving it has worked
(to some degree) for Esperanto, but Glosa does not have
100,000 users and 100 years to evolve credibility.

~tisu~ is 'tissue'. Is that flesh, or a kind of paper?

~titula~ is 'title'. I assume that would be a label, such
as the title of a book or the title of a person. Not a
document of ownership, right?

~tende~ has several meanings related to intention, but also
is listed for tendency. I believe the latter would be
covered either by ~norma~ and/or ~mode~. Any thoughts?

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 20 Oct 2001 20:56:50 -0700 (PDT)

~Tena~ currently has, as far as I can tell, three disparate
meanings:

1. hold, contain, keep, preserve, retain, stock (store),
conserve
2. grip, clutch, restrain
3. support, sustain, uphold

Actually, 'restrain' might be its own meaning, and perhaps
conserve might be its own as well. Perhaps grip and clutch
could be in with hold, but I see one concept of storage,
and another of posession.

I could see using ~manu~ for grip and clutch, exept that
one of the meanings of ~manu~ is currently 'hand over'. It
doesn't seem right to have one word have meanings similar
to both hold and release at the same time. 

So I guess I would see:
~stora~ contain, preserve, stock (store)
~tena~ hold, grip, grasp, clutch, retain, keep (retain)
~sofi-uti~ conserve
~???~ support, sustain, uphold

Help?

Kevin

An interesting way to put it.

If the ten (?) active people on this list voice their
preferences, then we can use a consensus to move forward.
Otherwise, it will be the editor of a given list who will
have to make their own (personal) decisions. At the moment,
for my list, that's me.

Glosa lacks a single, visible, authority figure. Actually,
having such a figure can be both a blessing and a curse.
Without that, I am trying to stick within what I understand
to be the intentions of Ron, Wendy, and y'all who have
worked on the GID.

Really, I don't see the disorganization as being a terrible
problem. I would expect Glosa (or any language) to become
less organized over time, with use. So we just have a
headstart :-)

As I said before, I would like to solve the problems
incrementally, rather than as a sweeping reform. In some
ways it is inefficient, but in others it is more efficient
(it's certainly easier and less painful). 

The incremental approach may not lead to the holy grail of
a perfect vocabulary, but then I don't think a perfect
vocabulary would remain so for very long, anyway.

That has never happened. Not even 5 of the 10. (See archives.)

I have no quarrel with that: Let 1000 flowers bloom!
(Or maybe "2000 roots".)

But it's unprincipled, and therefore doomed, IMO.

If not, why bother with an IAL? Or why not use one of
the neo-Latin IALs such as Interlingue? Incrementalism
is OK if it is constrained by good design (again IMO).
But who knows the method for Glosa vocabulary selection,
and who would want to follow it?

For me, Glosa's strongest appeal by far is its isolating
sentence structure. I don't like conjugations, and I like
the idea (whether true or not) that Glosa might be easier
for a Chinese person to learn than a neo-Latin IAL. There
are a lot of Chinese people in the world.

The vocabulary is secondary (to me). Learning a foreign
vocabulary will always be challenging. To whatever degree
the words can remind us of concepts by tapping into
commonly-used scientific roots, that's a plus. Beyond that,
it's more like a priori, where one of the main goals is
avoiding false friends.

I don't think Glosa's current vocabulary is substantially
worse than Esperanto's. Every language has flaws.

However, you are correct that if we can't build a small
community of people who care about Glosa and actually use
it, the language will not grow.

Date: Sun, 21 Oct 2001 23:16:07 -0700 (PDT)

I ran across mentions of Dutton SpeedWords as an IAL, and
noticed some similarities to Glosa. What really got my
attention was their list of 500 root words. I am still
struggling with the size of the Glosa core list, so I
thought I might learn something by looking at a small list.

It turns out the list is not bad, but certainly not large
enough for me to consider it as a good list of core
concepts. Dutton relies heavily on affixes to generate more
words, and the results are not represented in this list.

As an exercise, I mapped each of their roots to a Glosa
word. The result is available on my website, in a temporary
location (so please don't create any permanent links to it)
here:

Cute! You might consider expanding that to include
the top Ido/Espo roots or Lojban "gismu" or etc.
Another approach would be to use one or more of
the well-known "essential" English word lists,
as we discussed here a year or so back.

But I think the best system would be to take the list
of highest-frequency English words; 93% of all English
vocabulary by actual usage is covered by just 6000 roots.
You would need to list them anyway for your own use,
especially for semi-automated translation.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Mon, 22 Oct 2001 20:19:42 -0700 (PDT)

I was recently asked why I use "du" so much in my Glosa
writing. My response was that it's the only tool I know of
to indicate where the subject stops and the verb starts. 

As English speakers, we can usually figure out which word
is the first verb-like word in the sentence, but
technically, I believe it is ambiguous.

Take this example from the Glosa Basic Reference:
Na nece sti logi u demo.   

This could mean "Our need begins to understand a people",
or "Our requirement's beginning understands people". Rather
than the intended "We must make people understand."

So I would write "Na du nece sti logi u demo" or more
likely in this case: "Na fu nece sti logi u demo". 

Am I missing something?

You do need to use auxiliaries (or tense particles or something)
before verbs, and articles (or determiners or prepositions)
before objects, because like you said.

The answer is that the context gives
meaning to a sentence. Of all the
possible meanings a sentence can
have; what has just been said and
our knowledge of the world, limits
what is a possible meaning.

The brain sorts this out 
automatically, if it is given a bit
of practice. How often do you
even notice the ambiguities in 
English  sentences?

I had stopped noticing your use of
~du~. Why not use ~nu~? That
would not imply that you are 
always "still" doing things.

*   Saluta Mi plu amika,

    Quickly, in English, I would say that ~du~ is functional {continuous tense}, and not a necessary as a VERB PHRASE 'flag'.


    IF ... and that is a big word ... if the glosa is well (thought out and) written, then the start of the 'action' will be clear.


    Simply, there is a difference between,


      ~U kanis fago u sito.~    AND    ~U kanis du fago u sito.~

     [the dog eats the food]          [the dog is eating the food]

                                      [...  continues to eat  ...]


    I believe that harder than locating the start of the VP can often be defining the VP's end.  This difficulty occurs with 'phrasal verbs' in English:   The boy ran over the road.   The car ran over the boy.


   Who, or what, is "over"?  When is it a verb aauxiliary, and when is it a preposition?  There are even more outrageous constructions in English, but I haven't time to think them up.


   In Glosa we do have AUXILIARIES which are the bits you add after the 'verb', or VERBOID,  E.G.  ki in;   kade ex;   dice supra.


         ~Un alti, koleri gina celero ki in u kamera.~ 

        [the tall angry woman quickly moves into the room]


                             | VERB PHRASE |

         The tall angry woman goes quickly into the room.  .... 1.


    OR is ~ki in~  =  enter  ?    ... ~in~  being a verb auxiliary ???


        [the tall angry woman quickly enters the room]

                      

                             | VERB PHRASE  |

         The tall angry woman quickly enters the room.   ...... 2.


If there is a problem, and there seems to be one, is it an English language problem or a Glosa language one?


Is the meaning of the Glosa phrase much the same, either way?  OR  Do we need different Glosa renditions of the two resulting English sentences (1. & 2.), when we attempt to translate them back to Glosa?


My belief is that it is an English language problem (error/fault), and not a Glosa problem. 


N.B. In the Glosa sentence, the 'qualifier', ~celero~, is the 'flag' indicating the start of the VERB PHRASE.


N.N.B. In the first two Glosa sentences, there is a clear, function-word 'flag', ~du~, at the start of the second VP; but, with the first sentence, the VP comprises only one word, the substantive, ~fago~, and this word must be taken as  the 'flag' for the start of that phrase.


 Rule 1 in Glosa syntax is the NP-VP-NP, Subject-Verb-Object Rule.  Any self-respecting Glosa word finding itself sandwiched between two NOUN PHRASES has to acknowlege that it has the position of, and must have the function of, a VERB PHRASE.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

 P.S. I might do as Kevin suggests, and write in Glosa, but we are having a very difficult Federal election over here - what with war hysteria and the deepening recession/depression - and I am standing as the "No GST" candidate for my area.  So, time is at a premium.  Also, with the way that our conservative government is changing into a right-wing dictatorship, we mightn't need elections in four year's time .. after martial law is imposed.  So, this might be our last chance to fight for democracy, and I fear that we will lose!    R.G.

*  Forcing people to understand things is a difficult concept at the best of times .. look at education, advertising, propaganda and politics.  Maybe I contradict the basic reference, here, but I would push the words together into a clearly defined concept structure, by sticking in a hyphen.  Perhaps Ron Clark forgot to put it in, or as usual, he thought people were more intelligent than they are, and that they could read his mind.


   Needless to say, in context, and in the heat of the political debate, EVERYONE would know what was implied by ~Na nece sti logi u demo.~

  But it is  bad example for learners trying to learn Glosa - cold - without context. 


   Actually, though, ~nece~ could not be much other than a VERBOID, here.  However, without the hyphen to bind the words into one concept, your reading of ~nece~ as a 'noun' could be correct.

 

   [We needs must make understand the people]

   [Our need: to make understand the people]

   

~Na nece: sti-logi u demo.~"Our need (is to) make the people understand"

                           "We need (to) make the people understand." 


      The trick I use here is adding some punctuation: true, in speech, we cannot see the punctuation, but we can hear the vocal inflections.

    The difficult cases seldom come up in polite letter-writing, but there needs to be some rule for all cases, because, with Glosa, *we are all learners.*


    What you are missing is the somewhat elusive ''feel'' of Glosa: it is not boringly prescribed, but excitingly poetic.  However ther is a sort of magic portal you go through to feel at ease with the language.


    I must try to find time to write in Glosa, as well.

It is functioning as a tense/aspect marker, and because Glosa
places that sort of particle at the beginning of a verb phrase,
it also serves to flag where the preceding noun phrase terminated.
In other languages, such particles are agglutinated to the verb.

Just running together the major words without particles
results in confusing "headline English" that can be parsed
only with the help of context and ESP. We need to make
at least one "grammatical" part-of-speech division, to
distinguish between the particles and content-words.

Yes, that's another big problem. Some people (Romans) might try
to solve it by preposing and attaching the adverb to the verb.
If many people ever try to use Glosa, some will do likewise.

Yes! Importing more English into Glosa seems inadvisable.
I've written simple language parsers and can attest to the
difficulty of locating phrase boundaries when those little
"redundant" particles are elided. What makes a language easy
to learn and use is a clear separation (and definition) for
the 100 or so essential grammatical function morphemes.

And the authors of Glosa apparently realized this, because
they have separated the vocabulary into (somewhat ideosyncratic)
categories. They have not taken the final step of explaining
that every noun phrase begins with a quantifier or preposition,
and a verb phrase requires an initial TAM or voice particle.
But that's the way it makes sense and can actually work.
(Oversimplifying just a little.)

Good luck. But having dabbled in politics a bit here, I prefer
to solve human problems with technology. A good IAL on the net
would be worth many election victories.

Would this be "moves within the room" or "moves into the
room"? I would have expected it to be the former.

But couldn't this be "The tall angry feminine speed(thing)
moves in the room"? Or "The tall(thing) angrily and
femininely moves in the room"? I know these particular
words seem unambiguous, but would that be true of all words
in this sequence?

I keep trying to come up with an example, and haven't
really found a good one. Why? It seems that although Glosa
words can theoretically be used as noun/verb/adj/adv, most
of them really can't. Most words are really locked into one
or two parts of speech, by their definition.

I'll keep thinking about this.

Good luck!

By the way, your RTF posts are fairly inconvenient for me
to read. If you can paste the text to be inline, that would
be great.

The traditional parts of speech are not respected by
modern linguists, nor by generations of unhappy students.
But some division into rational word classes is necessary,
and makes parsing (and reading) less intractable.

The original Interglossa defined a small set of "verboids"
intended to constitute the entire set of verbs -- a radical
concept that could be rehabilitated in the form of "light verb
constructions". Ogden did something similar in Basic English.

Instead of "Bob kicks the dog", "Bob gives a kick to the dog".
Eliminating the heavy verbs can solve many difficulties!

    I myself think that this was one of the strong points about
Interglossa.  With the set of verbal words small and fixed, and their
their meaning developed by "amplifiers," the problem of recognizing 
verb phrase boundaries was much reduced.

Hi!

I'm a newcomer to this list and to Glosa in general.
A brief info about myself:
I'm an amatour in linguistics and am lurking through a few of
lang-lists here (conlang, auxlang, glosalist and such).
As to my knowing languages, I speak/read/write Russian (my native
language), English, a bit of Esperanto and German. And now I'm rather
impressed by Glosa :)

I hope I could be of use as a Russian speaker...

And I have a question. Lurking through this list's archive I've noted
that 'du' is used as a default verb marker. But in Glosa descripthions
that I've met in the net it was said that 'du' means continous
tense... Am I wrong?

Sincerely yours,
Mikhail Adigeyev

P.S. Sorry for possible mistakes in my English... :(

I found that I was often not sure of the meaning of glosa sentences because 
,mainly, of the difficulty of pinning down the verb phrase. I experimented 
with "du" although it was not quite orthodox. Other people have followed 
suite and I have found their glosa much, much easier to follow. However I 
agree that "du" is not really the best choice. We hav e"pa" and "fu" for past 
and future but nothing for present. As far as I see it, there is no or hardly 
any such thing as present tense - things start in the past and finish in the 
future so I wonder whether  "pafu", "pu", "fa"  might not be better. mi pafu

Lojban is not a good model for a real language, nor is Esperanto;
I would not trust any feature that isn't found in a great number
of natural languages, preferably a majority.

Nearly all human languages do use TAM morphemes or auxiliaries
as Glosa does to flag verbs (and something similar for nouns).
But in Tok Pisin there *is* a particle "i" used to separate
the subject from predicate (verb); however, it is disappearing
from common use. It works something like this:

Subject i verb. (intransitive)
Subject i verb em object. (transitive)

There are plenty of useful particles listed at the bottom of
the basic Glosa reference page, and they work better than
the TP method to flag the verb phrase without redundancy.
Not just the TENSES, but also the MODALS and VERBOIDS:

It's not at all unusual, especially in Asia. More like 33%.
Languages tend to cycle through analytical/isolating to
agglutinating to inflectional. Egyptian went around the
loop several times.

Read through the Glosa samples for instances of auxiliaries
such as "sti" used to introduce a verb phrase. Using an
adverb-of-time isn't the only or necessarily best way.

> ["Pote" and "bali" can act as the nouns 'capability' and

With some difficulty anything can be verbed or nouned ...
"u bali = a throw", but without such a clear indication
(or override) "bali = to throw" retaining its verbiness.

    No, you are correct.  It is only some of the active users here 
who seem to think that they need to use a default verb marker.  Not
everyone agrees.  'Du' is actually a continuative/imperfective aspect
marker.  One of the design principles behind Glosa, if I have
understood them correctly, is that as a strictly isolating language 
it is not necessary to mark verbs for tense, aspect, or mood unless
a particular situation actually requires it -- nor nouns for number.

P.S. I have found these concepts handy:-

        'verb' =  substantive word functioning as a verb.

        Sequential heirarchy in both VERB PHRASES and NOUN PHRASES, such

           that the least semantically significant words are at the start

Karo Syd,

    I do think that Glosa's Present Tense is very wide, and does not need
extra emphasis; only when wishing to specify a point in the present,
would it seem necessary to locate a ~nu~ at the start of the VERB
PHRASE.

   ~nu~ was added by Ron Clark after he sorted out the simple tense
particles, when he saw the need for pin-point a moment in time.

   The English tense construction "... will have ..." is given by the
Glosa construction, ~fu-pa~, and I am trying to recall any suggested
meaning for the ~pa-fu~ reverse construction, but can't.  However, I do
believe the hyphen is necessary to avoid the human speaker from sounding
it as one word, and also, for the mechanical reader (computer) to
recognise it as a construction of two words, and not as a neologism.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

   Ron did go heavily on the punctuation within Glosa sentences, suggesting
that as syntax is all about structure, perhaps we could demark phrasal and
clausal boundaries with colons (:), semicolons (;) and commas (,).

   Maybe the humble comma can be, where necessary, a NP starter 'flag.'

   As I recall, the idea was to indicate the start of phrases, where
necessary for clarity, with a comma, and for the start of clauses, a
semicolon would indicate the greater complexity of the 'flagged'
syntactical unit.
  EG (using English)
   The boy; who was running up the hill, unfortunately broke his 
          ^                            ^ 
          |                            |
          Adjectival Clause 'flag'     (end of clause)/'flags' VERB PH
           

leg, as he fell.
   ^
   |
   'flag' for Indirect Object = NOUN PHRASE


    In this example, there was no need to flag the Object "his leg." 

   As I have said before, English is a 'bastard language' having both
syntactic grammar and inflections.  However, in it, the use of punctuation
has proved very handy over the years.  Have a look at you favourite
novelist's work: select an action scene, and read analytically to see how
many commas and semi-colons have been used.  In the excitement of reading,
these punctuation marks did not impinge on your consciousness; but, they
certainly helped by ensuring that you got the full meaning of the action
scene, and rapidly so.
  The same applies to Glosa, which has the syntactic grammar of English,
but lacks its inflections.  Probably, the use of punctuation is even more
important in Glosa than it is in English.
  A difference, here: you have not had the experience of reading action
scenes in Glosa novels.  This suggests that there is a need for Glosa-pe to
write some racy short stories in the language.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S. In my attempt to abstract the syntactic structures from the words
(GAS System), I used single spaces for gaps between symbols representing
words, double spaces between the symbols of different phrases, and triple
spaces for the gaps separating clauses.  I did not show any punctuation.
So, I suggest that there are creative ways around all problems: perhaps the
Glosa-pe can agree on the most suitable, and possibly most creative, way of
'flagging' phrases and clauses.  R.G.

*   This is the rule stated very clearly.

    However, what IS missing from Glosa because of this 'lean' structure is
the idea of "redundancy."  If a Glosa message could get garble through an
imperfect communication channel, then it is very possible that some element
of redundancy would be introduced.

EG (English)   a boy/ the boys   .   goes/ went; did go; was going

   (Glosa)     u ju-an/ plu ju-an   .   ki/ pa ki; pa du ki

   Obviously, redundancy has come into English for a good reason; and, the
need for it can perhaps be discovered in Glosa: possibly there is no such
thing as a perfect communication channel, but the Glosa authors simply
assumed that it would be there.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

Agreed (in principle). But where is the unambiguous list of
words that indicate the start of a verb-phrase?

Which leads me to expect any Glosa word list to clearly
indicate which words are ok to use as nouns, which are ok
to use as verbs, etc. Or, at least, what the "default" part
of speech is for each word.

Forgive my bad attitude (I haven't gotten enough sleep this
week), but I thought one of the key features of Glosa was
that any non-particle word could take on any part of
speech.

Interesting history...but I'm not sure where it leaves us.
It sounds like Ron had something in mind, but chose to
leave (or pull) it out of what became official Glosa.

Personally, I see hyphens as a great tool to indicate
compound words. I'm not sure I like using them to group
entire phrases.

I'm still trying to figure out how to know (not guess)
where a verb phrase starts.

Hasn't been made, only implied. The categorizations done
by the authors for the glosaref and glosa-classified
are helpful but not entirely satisfying.

I haven't noticed any lack of politeness or reasonableness.
Indeed, the authors have attempted to erase the differences
between nouns, adjectives, and verbs. But the only way it
seems possible is to regard the 200-or-so grammatical particles
as a class of "clitic" morphemes, that coerce the open class
of "generic roots" into their proper grammatical functions.
Like little tugboats or something.

They don't :-) Russian is heavily inflecting language, with free word
order. Thus, it's an 'antipode' for Glosa.

Thank you for your explanations, Robin. I will surely visite your
site.

There are some features in Glosa that I consider, eh, not so nice.
If you wouldn't consider if too saucy, I'll tell what thay are:
1) 'x' makes spelling irregular. This letter makes Glosa words
recognizable by people, who know Latin or Romance languages (or
English, which accepted Latin roots without transformation). But for
future generations (when Glosa will be accepted as IAL :)))) ) this
will be just an odd feature...
2) 'q': well, I dont know exactly, how many languages have this sound
claster? Russian doesn't. This sound was included in Glosa just for
simplifing Latin roots' recognizability, wasn't it?
3) I have troubles trying to pronounce words with vowel clusters,
especially in the end of the word. Why not use, say 'qesti' instead of
'questio'?
4) I think, that forming imperative by using bare verb is absolutely
euro-centric... Do other languages do this? Why not use special
particle for this purpose?

One more thing with pjonology: as far as I know, both chinese and
japanese languages don't distinguish 'l' and 'r' (chinese has only 'l'
and japanese has only 'r'). I think, chinese and japanese speakers
will have troubles speaking Glosa...

And I have a question about stress. Some sources say that penultimate
syllable should be stressed, others advise to stress the vowel before
the last consonant? Where should I stress the word 'quesio'?

Thanks for answers.

Interesting example. I would want to say something like
~kani maxi-ami pe~, which would be "dog(s) maximum-friend
person(s)". In this case, I think (?) ~pe~ is clearly the
object, 

I think we could omit the initial u/plu without losing
much. However, that does bring back your other question
about the imperative. How do we know that ~kani~ is the
subject, and not a command. 

It goes back to whether we can "know" that a given word
defaults to being noun-ish, verb-ish, etc. I don't have an
answer for this one.

It's definitely not clear where the verb starts, so I feel
a need to insert some verb-start indicator. 

So I guess I might say:

  uno-kani pan-tem maxi-ami a pe
  any dog(s) always best-friend to person(s)

Do you find Glosa to be easy and fun? Or strange and
difficult?

Grati! I'll respond, and hopefully be in line with the
official answers.

This certainly would be easier if we changed 'x' to 'ks':
  ~akexi~ -> ~aleksi~ 
And for words starting with 'x', change to 'z':
  ~xeno~ -> ~zeno~
(since I have a hard time pronouncing it as "kseno" or
"kzeno" anyway)

Personally, I would be willing to give up the visual
recognition of 'x', since it's not used that much. But it
would be a significant change to the language. 

Is there any support for allowing alternate spellings? I
don't think I would like that option, because usually I
feel that options in a language make it _more_ difficult.

> 2) 'q': well, I dont know exactly, how many languages

recognizability, 
> wasn't it?

Probably. Again, it would be easier if we changed 'q' to
'kw':
  ~quadra~ -> ~kwadra~

Or we could just drop the 'w' sound entirely, and either
pronounce 'q' and 'k' the same way, or spell everything
with 'k'. But we would hit several major conflicts:
  ~qo~ -> ~ko~ !!!

Again, I'm not that fond of 'q', and it's not used that
much, so I wouldn't mind switching to 'kw'. But again, it
would be a big move for the language. And, again, I would
probably be opposed to making it an option.

> 3) I have troubles trying to pronounce words with vowel

> 'qesti' instead of 'questio'?

Agreed. There aren't too many of these, but we should see
if we can gradually shift to the easier versions, like the
one you mentioned.

> 4) I think, that forming imperative by using bare verb is

Why not

Interesting. It certainly is common among Auglangs. But,
then, most of them are Euro-clones anyway! I assume Russion
probably inflects the verb. Glosa would probably use a
particle to indicate an imperative, similar to 'qe' for
questions.

I have noticed a bit of ambiguity, because the first thing
may be a verb. To be consistent, I should at least stick a
verb marker at the front:
  Du lava  tu    manu
  Wash    your hands

But it is still ambiguous sometimes, as in:
   Pluvi.
   (It is) raining <or>
   (Please) rain

> And I have a question about stress. Some sources say that

I

Vowels that appear together are treated as a single
syllable, 
so those two rules are saying the same thing. It would be:
  ~QEST-io~

Thank you again for bringing up some interesting
discussions.

I should mention that there are a several letter
combinations in Glosa that I have a fair amount of trouble
pronouncing:

~excepti, excepti, excite~
~equs~
~frustra~ (not quite sure why)
~gnata~
~hiao~
~leuko~
~meio~
~psiko~
~ptero~
~punkta~
~ritmo~

mi du audi ko mi oti,

Is there a good reason to have (or not have) different
words for the organ and the action? Would it be beter to
have:

mi du audi ko mi audi ALO
mi du oti ko mi oti ALO
mi du audi ko me audi-ra

Or do we need different words for "nose" and "smell (v)"?
We have ~rino~, so should ~nasa~ be "smell (v)"?

Also, is there really a difference between ~skope~ (look)
and ~vide~ (see)? In English, it's idiomatic that seeing is
more like being aware of something, whereas looking is more
passive. But how would you describe the difference(s) these
two words to a non-English speaker?

Saluta!
It's very good that there is one more glosa-pe in Russia.
But, do you really believe that Glosa isn't very similiar to Russian in some
things? The most common thing is, of course, conceptions that were selected
for Glosa vocabulary. Glosa is the only IAL that have different translations
for "úÁÞÅÍ" É "ÐÏÞÅÍÕ".

(uses...word order)

"Which" would probably be better than "who", here, and
instead of doer you could say simply "does". I assume you
meant to type "changed". "Maked" isn't a word...perhaps
"created". "Affected" would be a great word, here. So this
could become:

It means that first we write a thing, which does an action,
then we write a verb and after that another thing, which is
affected/changed/created by the action.

> E.g. Mi vide u feli. Mi= I, vide=see, u = one, feli =
cat. 

Actually, ~u~ is "a" or "the", as opposed to ~mo~ which is
"one".

This would all be so much easier if English weren't part of
our world!

Right, qo-te (from tende) for intention, and qo-ka (from
kausa) for cause. It is an unusual distinction, but does
improve precision.

I agree, and Glosa's phonology could benefit from a revision.
The more letters removed, the better (easier pronunciation),
and worse (less visual and aural recognizability).

> ~excepti, excepti, excite~

It's CEPTI=accept, and EXCEPTI=except. The pattern is obvious.
Latin EX is Greek EK, so that's one possible fix for this case.
There are thousands of internationally recognized words using
the pattern of Latin EX, AD, CON, RE, PRE, and etc, as prefixes.

The first design choice is whether to allow them in Glosa or not,
and the authors have chosen the affirmative. But then they also
chose to spell "phonetically", which means that the boundaries of
pure compounds will undergo certain unfortunate changes (sandhi).

Imagine actually pronouncing "eks-chepti" or "eks-chludi"!
It's enough of a mess to demand a reform -- EKSEPTI that
no solution is going to please anybody.

Q should be eliminated by KU, I think. X should be KS.

Bad consonant clusters, GN and STR. For easy and consistent
spelling and pronunciation, all CCs must be removed. But,
most Latin/Greek roots would change beyond recognition.
Perhaps a careful selection could turn up enough roots
of the simple CVCV variety for a useful vocabulary?

Diphthongs are just as bad as consonant clusters.
Maybe just a few like AU and AI would be OK?

Perhaps clusters are acceptable when separated by
syllabic boundaries, like RIT-MO. Which leads to
other questions about terminal vowels etc.

In my own core list, I've eliminated most of the "exc..."
words:
excele -> fo-boni
excepti -> exklude (not great, but better)
excesi -> plus
excite (still there so far)

This is a good example of where I am willing to let the
language evolve over time, rather than attempt a big
reform. The drawback is that existing material with 'x'
would become obsolete, and the longer we wait, the more
existing material there will be. 

But that approach has worked well for natural languages, so
why not use it for an IAL as well? (Or, at least it has
"worked". Whether it has worked "well" is a matter of
opinion.)

Generally two-vowel diphthongs are ok for me (of course,
I'm used to them in English). Those three-vowel
combinations are really hard. I guess they would be
something like:
  hiao = "h-yeow"
  meio = "mayo"

Of course, I've removed meio from my list, by combining it
with mei, and hiao is basic, not core.

    It is confusing, both in the original Glosa documents and
elsewhere, to refer to 'u' as meaning 'a' and/or 'the'.  In other
words, the same little word could mean either definite or indefinite! 
Several years ago, in a paper mail, Wendy Ashby agreed that 'u' is
really a noun marker rather than the confusing 'a/the'.  (The same
holds, obviously, with 'plu'.)

Ok. I can see that if you really want to say "a book" you
could say ~mo bilbi~. How would you say "the book"? 

I guess it depends on whether you mean "the (only) book":
~solo bibli~ or "the book (that is further identified)": ~u
bibli epi u mensa~ ???

And why don't we have an equivalent verb marker? :-)

How to translate these examples?

Austin is *a* city
Austin is *the* capital
Austin is beautiful

The vowels should be pronounced separately.
~hiao~ like "hee-ah-aw" (UK Southern English).
"18 Steps" say ~leuko~ is pronounced "layookaw".

I agree, they are noun markers. 

But in practice this also means that they correspond to 
"a/the" in English. The confusion this may cause is not 
general. For example, Russian manages to get by without
this definite/indefinite distinction!


And speaking of Russian...
I too would like to welcome Mikhail Adigeyev to the list.
It's great to have people on the list whose native language
is not English, like Alexander, Marcel, Kjell  and Henry. 
Contributions from their perspective are very helpful to 
getting a view of Glosa free from the distortions caused 
by looking through "English spectacles".

Saluta,
Nick

The Glosa word lists give the verb meaning for part 
of the body "X" as "to use X" ~akti per X~.

~oku~ = peep
~nasa~ = smell or sniff
~oti~ =  'bug'
~pedi~ = kick
~pugna~ = punch
~denti~ = grin
~glosa~ = lick
~kubita~ = nudge
~palma~ = slap
~manu~ = pass/hand over or smack
~beka~ = peck
~peri-braki~ = hug

For me, there is not a significant difference in meaning.
I would say it relates to degree of attention paid to the
visual sensations.

Subject: [glosalist] Word List Progress (and a question)
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 27 Oct 2001 18:11:05 -0700 (PDT)

I'm getting fairly close to a first release of my Glosa
word list. I've "promoted" about thirty words from "basic"
to "core". I have not had to invent any new words, nor
import any non-basic GID words. 

I've replaced quite a few long imported words with compound
words made up of core roots, and simply omitted quite a few
words because they are redundant or not truly core words.

Anyway, one of the biggest single changes I've made
involved several words. I'd like to get the group's
feedback on whether I've made any bad decisions in this
area. I'm certainly willing to adjust my definitions as
needed.

Here are my current entries:

* insignia: Removed from the list
* makula: spot (stain), stain (spot), mark (stain), blot
(stain), smear
* marka: mark (blemish), blemish, scratch, nick
* nomina-signi: signature (newly added)
* sema: sign (n), signal, gesture, beckon, token
* signatura: Removed from list
* signi: sign (brand), mark (brand), badge, brand, symbol
* signi-te: flag, banner, pennant (newly added)

Do you agree that they "hold together" as a group, and
follow the "one concept=one word" philosophy? Are they
reasonably compatible with the existing intended (GID)
meanings?

Kevin

Well, ~oti~ = 'bug' just makes no sense at all. I'm not
putting that in my core list.

For several of the others, it seems really weird to me to
have the word for a body part have a very specific, often
rare, meaning as a verb. Why would ~oku~ be "peep", and not
"see"? Why would ~denti~ be "grin", and not "bite"?

~pedi~ could be "step on". ~pugna~ could be "pound",
~kubita~ and ~palma~ seem ok, but somewhat idiomatic.

Maybe it would be better to disallow using body parts as
verbs. Or perhaps only use them in completely unambiguous,
non-idiomatic cases: eyes see, ears hear, noses smell, and
tongues lick.

I don't know what to do.

Kevin

"Use head." I mean, ignore such silly notions.
Glosa is replete with nonsense like that,
most from Hogben but some from Ron & Wendy.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>

~pulsa~ currently has two distinct meanings:
1. pulse, pulsate, throb...
2. push, shove, thrust...

Unfortunately, I can't find any other Glosa word for
*either* of these definitions. The best I've thought of so
far is:

~pulsa~ push, thrust, shove...
~itera-pulsa~ pulse, pulsate, throb...

Any other ideas?

I have just published a new Glosa-English word list. I

The third column indicates if each word was taken from

The categories of words ("Colors", "Animals") need more
work.

Please tell me, is it good? Or not?

Subject: [glosalist] Words that I removed
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 28 Oct 2001 12:59:16 -0800 (PST)

In case anyone is curious, I have a list of words that I
removed from my word list before publishing it. That's
about 650 words (so far). Words were removed for several
possible reasons, which are tagged as follows:

1. Another word was better for that meaning
(x-core->newword)
2. The word was too rare to be in core (x-core-rare)
3. The word wasn't in core to begin with (x-basic)
4. The word didn't have clear Glosa roots (x-core-noroot)
5. The meaning of the word was unclear (x-core-unclear)
6. The compound word was obvious and unhelpful
(x-core-nohelp)

I think that's all the reasons. Note that in many cases I
split a word into two meanings, and then marked one of the
meanings as being removed. For example, ~porta~ was
retained as doorway, but the meanings of "port", "haven",
and "carry" were removed.

Anyway, the page is up in a temporary location, so if you
are really interested in it I suggest you download a local
copy. Also note that I'm not done removing words yet, so
this list will continue to grow. Currently, it is here:

  http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa/removed.txt

Eventually, I'll remove it. Assuming I have time, I hope to
incorporate all this information into a detailed document
describing all my word list changes (adds, omits, etc.).
For now, if you're really curious where your favorite word
went, this should answer it.

Kevin

Austin es civita.
Austin es kapitala.
Austin es kali.

    Why is it necessary to use any kind of article at all?  Latin
managed for a millenium and a half without articles.  Russian friends,
am I right that modern Russian has no articles?  Those of us whose
native languages use articles are sometimes puzzled that a language 
can function without them.  My own opinion is that an international
auxiliary language is better off without articles at all.  Even 
languages that have articles do not use them in the same way, as can
readily be ascertained when a non-native speaker uses articles in ways
that sound odd to native speakers.

No, that loses the significant differences.

> Why is it necessary to use any kind of article at all?

You can replace the function of articles, *but*
you shouldn't just ignore or forget those functions.
Others will say you can delete the copula, as in Russian.
Sure, but you still need to be able to translate the
ideas accurately, from any language. Baby, bathwater.

Yes, you are right. As far as I know, Russian never has articles at
all. We use words like 'that' to explicitely show that the object was
mentioned before.
I think, special particles could be more flexible and useful to
express definiteness of objects.

And if we introduce compulsory definite/indefinite atricles, we have
to state a number of rules of using them in cases which are not
evident (like geographical names, organizations, matters, etc). This
will complicate language a good deal, IMHO.

I recently wondered if we could use ~u-co~ instead of ~id~.
Do you agree? Do you like or dislike [the idea]?

Kevin

P.S. ~u-co~ means "the just-said (used as a
subject/object)", which seems (to me) to be what ~id~ also
refers to. I'm no language expert, so I could be way off
here. It just seemed like an interesting way to reuse part
of the language, increasing consistency.

Saluta!

The main Glosa site (www.glosa.org) has info in several languages, but
not in Russian. I think that translating it into Russian (at least
main info pages) would be useful.

I could do such translation (based on English version of glosa site),
though I cannto promise this will be soon (I'm always short of time
:(( ). Perhaps, Alexander could join me? Or he already works on this
task?

Is it possible to add Russian variant of the site?
I think, it is Marcel Springer, who can do it?

~-co~ refers to the whole of the previous sentence or paragraph,
while ~id~ usually refers to just a previously mentioned noun.

~Id~ also acts as an empty pronoun, with no referent as in:
~Id ne pluvi.~ = "It's not raining."
to distinguish the sentence from
~Ne pluvi.~ = "Don't rain!"

The translation seems good to me.
Can you explain what the significant differences are?

The indefinite article means "one of possibly many,
and one which has not been discussed recently".
You can figure out the definite and the adjectival uses.

In languages without articles, these distinctions must
be marked on the verb or idiomatically or with the
addition of many more words.

1. About my mistakes in text, sorry, but you can see that all this mistakes
have Glosa origine...
2. It's a very good idea to translate glosa.org into Russian.
3. I'm sure that my program will be able to change the international
communications in the internet. It works better than UTL, it is free, an it
can destroy "Babel" in the Internet.
4. I invite those, who speak foreign languages translate the corrected text
for my program.
5. Russian had articles in ancient times, but after evolution the language
need np articles any more.

Some people have article-phobia and I don't wish to scare them,
but there is a whole set of words usually called "determiners"
to handle all the necessary functions in Glosa. One of those
functions is to show where noun phrases begin, just as tense
particles and auxiliaries mark the start of the verb phrase
(mainly, the direct object; other cases have prepositions).

I question the adequacy of the set of determiners in Glosa,
because it seems nobody can adequately translate the 3 most
common uses of English articles. Of course it could be easily
fixed by adding a particle or two if lacking. All natural
languages have some means of expressing these things ...

I haven't really formed a strong opinion, so I'd like to
understand this further.

When we say "Austin is *the* capital", we really mean that
it is the capital _of Texas_. There are certainly many
capitals in the world, so if we leave Texas out of the
sentence, it is actually more accurate to say that Austin
is *a* capital (~Austin es krati-urba~).

Now, if we really do want to say that Austin is *the*
capital of Texas, how do we say that in Glosa? ~Austin es
mo krati-urba de Texas~? That makes it sound like it's one
of many. ~Austin es u solo krati-urba de Texas~? I guess
that works. It does require two extra words. 

I don't think we could say ~Austin es solo krati-urba de
Texas~ because that would mean (to me) that Austin is
merely the capital of Texas.

For the third, ~Austin es kali~ or ~Austin du kali~ works
for me. 

Kevin

That would be great.

I would like a translation of
  http://www.glosa.org/brevi/english.htm
most, in any language one of you is able to translate into.

The English/German/Glosa main site has links, I could not update or
maintain in Russian, - unfortunately.

(Some parts of) "18 Steps to Fluency"
  http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm
would be nice, too (luxury I dream of).

Thank you very much for your offer !!!

A nice possibility, besides recognisability, is that you can pronounce
it KS or KZ without having to alter the spelling of words. Also
pronouncing it Z is allowed when it occurs as the first letter in a
word for example ~xeno~.

This also has possibilities for variations in pronunciation, KW or
KU. I think that even pronouncing it KV, would not make words
unintelligible.

The shortening of words in Glosa, is still an on-going process. So,
such a change would be in line with what the authors have been
doing up till now.

I believe that Mandarin uses a would meaning "invite" for this purpose.
Also I think, Hogben proposed in Interglossa that ~petitio~ (Glosa for
"invite") should be used. But I may have mis-remember that.

~Sti u lampa.~
~Place sti u lampa.~
~Petitio; tu sti u lampa.~

If you eliminate all sounds that are hard for people to pronounce, you
end up with only about 10 consonants and 3 vowels. I think it's better 
to tolerate some variation from a standard model pronunciation, 
than to end up with all your words looking and sounding very similar 
to each other.

Thanks, yes. A couple days ago I realized what use of 'bug'
was intended. And I did end up including it in my list. In
fact, each body part lists whatever actions I could think
of. Examples:

digi: finger, toe, press (use finger), tap (use finger)

oti: ear, bug (eavesdrop), eavesdrop (use ears), hear (use
ears), listen (use ears)

pedi: foot, paw, kick (use foot), tread (use foot), stomp
(use foot), step on (use foot)

That's what I was talking about. There's no graceful translation.

It also doesn't work to say "this" (demonstrative) to simulate
a true "the" (definite). Oddly, Glosa has both "u/un" and "mo"
but still lacks any true articles. Using "u/un = the" and
"mo = a/an" is much too ugly ...

Me too, and it illustrates something about terminology.
In many languages there are no adjectives, and "es kali"
would function as an intransitive verb. The particle
"es = is" isn't really even a verb in English, it's more
of an auxiliary or "copula". Another way to say it in
Glosa might be "Austin habe kali = Austin has beauty",
but again the putative verb is more of an auxiliary.
It gets even worse if "Austin kali" (deletion of the
copula) is allowed ...

The pattern that I think represents the True Spirit of Glosa
is something like this because it can't get much simpler
(optional stuff in parentheses, and ignoring pronouns/etc):

noun-phrase = (preposition +) determiner + (adjective +) noun

verb-phrase = (tense +) auxiliary + verb

intransitive-sentence = noun-phrase + verb-phrase

transitive-sentence = noun-phrase + verb-phrase + noun-phrase

I have updated my website, and created a new home page for
my Glosa activities. If you are linking to my site, please
now link to:
  http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa

I now have both alphabetical and category-based word lists,
and will continue to update this part of my site.
Eventually I will be removing various older Glosa files
from elsewhere on my site.

By the way, my word list currently has 1671 entries, of
which 400 are compound (hyphenated or two words), so I
currently list 1271 root words.

Kevin
