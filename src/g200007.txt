Subject: [glosalist] MAIN GLOSA AUTHOR DIES
From: Robin Gaskell <rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au>
Date: Wed, 05 Jul 2000 01:07:19 +1000

To All at Glosalist and Auxlang,

  Sad news.

  I just received news that Ronald Clark, who had a heart attack last year,
died of a second recently.

  A light in this darkness has been extinguished.

  Now, Wendy Ashby, currently without a Net connection, must decide how,
and if, she will continue the work of promoting Glosa without Ron.  She
needs all the support she can get, and letters of condolence can be sent to
    Wendy Ashby
    PO Box 18, Richmond
    Surry  TW9 1WD
    U. K.

  Ron wished to make a difference to the world, in showing that a Common
Second Language works and is already within our grasp.  I believe he did
leave his mark on history, and also that his "Glosa" is a world class
Auxiliary Language.  Ron Clark will be remembered, but a question mark
hangs over the social invention that he wished to give to the world.
  Will Glosa become a major component of the Better World we all seek?
  Through renewed effort, those who value the language, and share Ron's
dream for a Communicating World, will work with Wendy to create a new
chapter in the Glosa saga.

  Ave Ronald.

Robin Gaskell

    Syd, I offer to send you a floppy disk with much of my Glosa info on
it.  Please send your land address.

    I send you my best wishes for progress with the Net.  Simply ask, if
you have any problems, and many will quickly post you answers.

Saluta,

*   Dear Alexander,

    Thank you for your e-mail.  This IS the right question.  Unfortunately, I do not have a completely satisfactory answer.


ANSWER:

 1. My URL  www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell  has a lot of stuff on it, but no

instruction book, as such.

 2. I will send by separate message a Redirected message carrying other URLs for Glosa.

 3. As an attachment to this e-mail, I add the "Glosa Classified" file;

this has words grouped into collections with similar function.  It is an old file with some out-of-date addresses.

 4. I offer to send you a printed copy of "18 Steps to Euro-Glosa", which is a very basic introductory instruction book, written by the Glosa authors - please send your land address if you would like this.

 5. I will send an IBM 3.5 inch floppy disk with various Glosa files on it, if you would like it - again, land address needed.

 6. There is one cassette that I have made up using spoken Glosa together with printed Glosa/English sheets.  I would rather send this as a sale item: cost = replacement cost of blank cassette; minimum payment an Australian $5 note from a Russian bank; but if this is not possible, FREE.


 #7. I have been planning, for some time, to prepare a Glosa instruction course based on a successful English-language course, that uses cassette

instruction.  Your request might signal the need for me to start this project.  If you are interested in Alpha-testing such a course, I would treat you as a part author in the project; the cost of postage of materials, to you, would be bourne by me.



  So, I welcome your request, and it could stimulate me to action.  Setting up a cassette-based instruction course for Glosa is well overdue.

  It would, however be paper/cassette based and rely on normal postage for distribution.

  In theory, a suitable introductory instruction course shuld be available through the Internet: I will have to think about this!


Bien-venu a Glosa. Saluta,

[Welcome to Glosa. Greetings.]

                        INTRODUCTION

        * During the past 2 centuries Scientists have created a
world-wide technical Vocabulary.  As Modern Technology transforms
everyday life what was once the Vocabulary of the Laboratory becomes the
Vocabulary of the Street Corner.

        * Glosa has no grammer.  About 20 particles do all the work of
Tense, Number, Comparison, etc.

        * Below Glosa 1000 is divided into useful categories.

        * It is important to understand that this is no mere `get-by'
language, but a complete language able to deal with any theme as
demonstrated in the periodical PGN, Plu Glosa Nota.

        * Glosa words suffer no inflexion.  You take them straight from
the Dictionary and put them into sentences.

        * Glosa is a semantically based language. i.e. a group of words
which share a common element of meaning should show this in their form.
For example, an aviary, library, cattle-shed, theatre, stable, and
church, and many others all have a common element, in that they are all
buildings.  The Greek and Latin for a building contains the root DOM- as
in DOMestic, DOMIcile.  In Glosa any building ends with the generic -DO a
shorter form of DOMI.  In Glosa a library is a BIBLI-DO, a book-house, a
theatre a DRAMA-DO.  These Generics are listed below and enable you to
build up a very large vocabulary without having to memorize a great
number of words.
        Similarly, opposites in Glosa are formed by pre-positing NO- or
NON- before a vowel.  Thus ALTI, high as in ALTItude can be brought down
in NON-ALTI, low.

        * It is important to understand that each CONCEPT word stands for
an idea, and so corresponds somewhat to a Head-Word in Roget's Thesaurus,
standing for a great number of English words sharing the same idea.
Context gives precision.  The IndoEuropean languages all have far too
many homosemes, words meaning roughly the same.  This puts a great load
on the memory of a student; and this mistake is not repeated in Glosa.

        * All words in a Glosa Dictionary are to be found in any good
English Dictionary such as OED or Websters.  They also of course occur in
all other Euro-Dictionaries, French, German, and Russian, and outside
Europe in most oriental dictionaries such as Japanese and Malaysian.

Thank you, but In the biggest Russian banks my family lost almost all our

Please find the synonym.

dear Robin
have been thinking about a Latin/Glosa dic for a while. Instead of sending
word lists in umpteen different languages, we could use Latin as most
european people could get hold of a latin/own tongue without too much bother
and could move from own to latin to glosa. I suggest that this applies only
to G1000..... and that further dictionaries would have G8004 etc defined in
G1000. I did start one so I'll try to rake it up. I think G1000 is perhaps a
bit restricting although the idea is good and we might perhaps aim for
something like G3000. There seems to be a site about dictionaries but I
haven't dabbled yet. If someone has already done something in latin I'd be
interested.

So many of the roots are already Latin, Syd!?

But if you want a glossary with a lot of
international Latin roots visit my dictionary
pages at
http://adam.cheshire.net/~jjbowks/iglos/
They're all in ascii format and you may
edit to your heart's content :-)

thanks for your reply. I was very surprised indeed.
What/where is Ameslan?
What I was trying to do was to see if I could send a picture by e-mail (I'm a
fairly new recruit) so that I could send diagrams/illustrations about some
stuff I'm doing in Glosa, I presume you got a picture of a fist! (not meant
to be agressive). It was a random choice.
The shape was part of the letter "g" in fingertalk which is something I'm
working up to help poor blokes like me who are slightly deaf but hopeless at
lip-reading even after about 6 or 7 years at it.
I'm interested in alphabets and so on so I'd like to hear more.
saluta.....

Ameslan is American Sign Language.
I'm one of the two translators at our Kingdom
Hall on Sundays that helps out our deaf friends
enjoy the program.

The fingerspelling alphabet used in Ameslan
goes back many centuries and is based on
French and Spanish monks who used it
to communicate as they had taken a vow of
silence, imagine that, and now deaf people
all over the United States use this manual
alphabet to fingerspell.

I have a couple of fonts for windows which
you can use in any windows wordprocessor
to spell out things with hands on your screen.
It's pretty neat stuff. I've also used the signs
to teach Spanish pronunciation to my students.

If you'd like the fonts I'll email them to you
privately on a message, so as not to get the list
on a tangent :-)

Since,
Jay B.

Hi Alexander and other Glosalist-pe,

  Alexander your Glosa is understandable, and will get into proper form (syntax) as you go along.

  You are using the ^jump into the deep end of the pool^ method of learning Glosa.  And this is possibly the most valid ways of adding Glosa to your thinking.

1. ~Mi pa du vi URLs.~   ... "VERB" missing: vide = (to) see

Essential:-

a. ~Mi pa du vide vi URL.~

   [I did continue to see your(<<- plural) URL]

    I have been seeing your URL.

Alternative:-

a'. ~Mi pa vide tu plu URL.~

    [I di see your(<<- singular) (more than one)URL]

     I saw your URLs.

    >> This corrects for number, and puts the action out of continuous tense and into the simple past. <<<<


2. ~Na du mi trenta gene sko u lingua.~   ... spelling corrections

Essential:-

b.  ~Nu mi du tenta gene sko u lingua.~

    [now I continue to try to learn the language]

     Now I am trying to learn the language.

Possible:-

b'. ~Nu mi tenta gene sko de u lingua.~

    [now I try  to get learning of the language]

     Now I (will) try to learn the language.


3. ~Qe mi Glosa es veri?   ... concept-word selection: veri = (to be) true

   [question: my Glosa is true]

    Is my Glosa true?

Better:-

c'. ~Qe, mi Glosa habe korekti?~

    [(does) my Glosa have correctness]

     Is my Glosa correct?


  So, there you go Alexander.  This is quite a good effort for starting on a new language.

Overall Hints:

  ! Aim to 'think in Glosa' as soon as possible.

  @ As a "concept language" you can ask yourself:

      * is this the right word to convey my idea?

      * am I translating an idiom from a national language?

  # Check for "feel"; when you read yor sentence out loud:

      * does it bring your originally intended meaning back into mind?

      * does the srtring of words sound pleasant?

      * is the written sentence appealing to the eye?

         % If the answer to any of these questions is, "NO", then it is

             probably better to recast the sentence.


  By the way, I am happy that you have discovered Glosa, and that you are

checking the language out through practicing it.

  As your Glosa fluency improves, I will ask how you compare expressing yourself in Russian and in Glosa.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

Very interested idea,syd, but:
1. Latin has very hard grammar and orthography, and maybe necessary a "Other
artificial language"-Glosa dic? I have seen in Internet Ido-Glosa
dictionary, but Ido is not most popular artificial language in the world.
In the future after Russian/glosa I want make Esperanto-Glosa.
2. All Europeans can understand the meaning of any Latin sentence, but also
all Europeans can understand the meaning of any Glosa sentence.
But you right for regional Glosa dictionaries necessary the Basic
dictionary, because English has many homonyms. And translating of dictionary
is difficult.
Alex.
p.s. maybe in the letter my English is bad,  I am sorry, I hadn't time for
this letter.

I made the Ido-Glosa comparison, to demonstrate/discover
that their basic roots are quite similar. It is at:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/idoglosa.htm

I think the idea of a multi-lingual dictionary is good.
Occidental and Novial both have such dictionaries
(really they are just fancy word lists) but neither
is on the web in a complete state. See:
http://www.cs.brown.edu/~dpb/novial/nl.html

I have made many such word lists by combining others
found on the web. Here is a sample, words beginning
in "but..." in English, Glosa, Ido, and Lingua Franca:

glo     buta            eng     purpose
glo     butalis         eng     nightingale
eng     butcher         glo     macela
eng     butcher         glo     trucido
lf      butia           eng     bottle
ido     butik           eng     shop, store, boutique
glo     butina          eng     booty
glo     butiro          eng     butter
ido     buton           eng     button
glo     butona          eng     button
ido     butr            eng     butter
eng     butter          glo     butiro
eng     butter          ido     butr
eng     butter          lf      mantega
eng     buttercup       glo     ranunkulus
eng     butterfly       glo     lepidoptera
eng     butterfly       glo     papilio
eng     butterfly       ido     papilion
eng     buttocks        glo     pigi
eng     buttocks, rump  glo     glutea
eng     button          glo     butona
eng     button          ido     buton
eng     button          lf      botone

I think such lists are useful in designing an auxlang to
avoid "false friends" and pick tuly international words.
So, I think adding Latin and Greek equivalents would be
a very useful thing to do.

Taking as an example "butterfly", there are at least
two other good international words other than Glosa's
scientific choice "lepidoptera": "mariposa" and "papilion".
I have come to think this is unavoidable and OK; it does
increase the vocabulary so it is more difficult to learn.

But it is more honest and Glosa has done a good thing by
classifying words into categories, something that only
the Lingua Franca Nova auxlang has emulated or pioneered:
http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/lfnintro.html

I would propose that we do something like this:
make a 3-column list in several languages.
When multiple words are equivalent, list each
on a separate line, so that a sorted list
is easier to use, and columns are kept narrow.
There should be 50 to 100 different "categories".

category    Glosa          English
==========  =============  ===========
animal	    lepidoptera    butterfly
clothing    butona         button
occupation  macela         butcher
occupation  trucido        butcher

Then, such lists could be merged/combined by a program
to make customized lists, such as Glosa/English/Russian
or Glosa/French/Latin or Glosa/Ido/Novial/Latin/Greek,
posted on the web, and frequently corrected and updated
by all who wish to contribute their efforts. There are
some web-updated multi-lingual dictionaries already,
but not for auxlangs, and they are not systematic.

*  Okay folks,
   Finger/hand/sign language is not something I had thought of up 'til now,
in relation to Glosa.
   Did Ron and Wendy publish a particular set of hand signs?
   I can't recall seeing it.

   In the back of the Sydney phone directory there is a page headed,
_Learning to communicate with the deaf_, and it uses the same set of hand
signs that I learnt as a boy, and that my brother suggested for army use
(with telescopes), when radio communcation failed.
In it:
  G - Right fist hitting onto Left fist.
  N - Index and Middle fingers of Right hand on open palm of Left hand.

   So, a set of hand signs exists; in fact, a series of sets of hand signs
exists, and I have the sensation of ^going down for the third time^ ...

   Will the selection of the best/most-suitable/most-well-known set of hand
signs, for use with Glosa, be as much of a problem as the selection of the
IAL, from among the different languages?

   Would someone please put me in the picture.  Thanks.

   Soon I will have a Hewlett-Packard 5200 Scanner, then I will be able to
copy the page from my phone directory, and include it as a  .JPG  attachment.

   However, the question of finalising a 2500-word learning dictionary for
Glosa is considerably higher up my priority list.  The work, to date, sits
in floppy disks atop my computer waiting for me to make time to do it.

Saluta,
  Robin

   to bear: to be able to carry, or hold up. "bourne" is the participle.
   Are you using an English:Russian dictionary, or one that is entirely in
English?  Does your dictionary give etymological information [telling where
the separate parts of a word come from and what they mean] EG
      television: (tele Gr.=far; visio L.= seeing)?
   Concerning the posting of Cassettes, it will probably be a largely
one-way traffic: from me to you.  However, you can give feedbck, comments
and criticism over the Net.

*   Alexander added that Glosa, like Latin would act as a rough
communication medium for Europeans who knew only their Euro-language.
    And both Jay and Charles have been working on translating lists to
allow translation between Euro-languages and Auxiliary languages.

    It has long been my thought that Glosa, or an abbreviated sub-set of
it, would function, quite well, as a META-language for information booths
at international events .. like the coming Sydney Olympic Games.  But don't
worry, I have not approached the organising committee with any such
suggestions.

    But, for me, such do-gooding ideas are far in the future, considering
how long it is taking just to make headway with the Language, Glosa, on its
own.  I have no time to go off at tangents, at present.  Basically I am
working hard at the political level to prevent Australia from suffering a
fate, similar to the one that Alexander reports, as having befallen him in
Russia.

*   Agreed, to avoid unwanted homophones, this is a good idea.
    Sorting through dictionaries to find "commonality" was something that
Ron Clark was doing - selecting Glosa vocabulary - in 1977, when I met him.
    So, long prior to my joining discussion on the Net, I had already
assumed that the sorting work had all been done.  It was only when I
''reversed'' the Glosa 6000 dictionary (converting the Gl.-->Eng. list to
one showing Eng.-->Gl.), that I found Ron and Wendy had included many
unnecessary Classical synonyms, mainly Greek ones.
    Had the situation not gone beyond one Glosa word from the Greek, and
one derived from Latin, for single English words, I could have coped.
  EG water:  hidra G., aqa L.

*   This to me is a clear-cut case, and not one where fashion, or word
frequency, plays a part in the selection of the Glosa word.
    In my introduction to Glosa, I was told that it was a language for
science, and I still feel this to be fundamentally so.  Some centuries ago
scientists chose "Lepioptera" as the group name for butterflies, and it
would seem counter-productive to suggest breaking this Glosa/science
association now: I know that ~lepidoptera~ is longer, and less melodious,
than ~papilio~; and, though both words are in _Glosa 60000_, I still see
the scientific name as the prime word, with ~papilio~ as the synonym
available for stylistic and poetic purposes.

*   Yes this was a neat idea: I feel that Ron could see people were having
trouble in letter-writing, having to sort through the dictionary,
alphabetically, for every word.  The grouping of the various categories of
function words was, I feel, a particularly smart move.

*   However, to do this for every Glosa word would, I suspect, be
unnecessary, sometimes misleading, and possibly restrictive.
    Where homonyms occur, in either Glosa or English, I would see such
function/category statements as useful,  EG
       bear (to hold) -        tena
            (to give birth) -  nati
            (animal)  -        ursus

*   In the days of Early Glosa, Ron Clark (c. 1979) did form a multi
language dictionary with English, French, German and either Spanish or
Italian.  Nowadays the Glosa would not be the same, because it underwent
numerous small changes in the 80's.
    For the moment, I have no time or energy for the suggested compilations
Charles suggests, even though the Cyrillic and Greek scripts are catered
for in multi-lingual word processors.
    Finding agreements between the various Planned Languages, in the long
run, could be the hardest task of all, because their lexicons can appear
like ^shifting sands^.
    However, with retirement looming, and the fuuture somewhat uncertain, I
will concentrate all of my linguistic efforts solely on the promoting and
use of Glosa.

Saluta,
  Robin

Thank you for your grammar explications.
But  I cannot understand difference between gene sko, APRENDE, and MATI, all
these words meaning "learn", but what is difference?

I think you would accomplish much more with Glosa than politics.
Many people are working on the one, very few on the other.
Glosa now is threatened with extinction as a credible auxlang.

Local politics are irrelevant, only global economics matters.
Building a networked community that is international but
non-corporate and non-governmental, would be a possible solution.
The politics of opposition only result in deadlock or worse.

We need clever technological solutions that bypass the
politicians. We need to be active and do the work ourselves.
So, I say we should organize the world's first (or best)
multilingual auxlang vocabulary according to semantic fields.

A simple list cannot be learned at all by 99% of people, and a
fat fake dictionary like Gode's Interlingua cannot even be read.
Look at LFN's scheme and imagine how that could be improved:
http://www.ship.edu/~cgboeree/lfnvocab.html

I have made experimental web pages with forms with pull-down menus,
one for each semantic field. This could become a 1-page active
reference-thing in a way similar to that of Ogden's Basic English,
but containing thousands rather than hundreds of items.

It requires some time and energy and creativity and enthusiasm.
Or else, just let Glosa die with its authors. Sometimes a bad idea
blocks the path of good, like Esperanto did to better auxlangs.
If the few remaining Glosa leaders won't lead, followers must look
elsewhere. The idea of morphologically simple creolistic grammar
is good, but a senile/moribund Glosa can only block progress.

Esperanto does *not* look similar, Ido does because much work
was done to make the roots naturalistic. Glosa departed from
recognizable roots in the direction of phonetic spelling
and easier pronunciation for non-Europeans. So I expected
far less similarity than I found.

The dictionary needs some work. Who will do it?
The language needs some leaders. Who will lead?
Today it is easier to organize vocabulary material,
and to communicate internationally and quickly.
Here is the ideal project to build the community
of users and new leaders.

That is a false and hopeless direction.
Scientists use Greek roots non-systematically,
simply to generate near-meaningless random names.
The only true language of science is mathematics.
Greek is not useful for an auxlang, Latin is best;
only the Latinized Greek bits are any good.
Hogben was wrong on this point, and times changed.

Nobody will ever say "lepidoptera" in real life.
Too long, too formal, too silly. But I now suggest that
instead of removing any words, better ones be added.
After a fair sample of actually-used Glosa writings
from at least 100 users are accumulated, *then* notice
which terms are most popular and mark them in BOLD TYPE.
Let the ugly words die of disuse. Let people generate
lots of Glosa dictionaries. Make a controversy, see
if anyone *cares*, let evolution decide the winners.

I have changed my opinion on restrictiveness. Inclusiveness

English bare/bear/born/etc is unsatisfactory.
By cutting Glosa words too short, similar problems arise.
But long words like lepidopteras won't fly either.

What you're talking about Robin is the
two handed English system. The Ameslan
system, or Manual Alphabet system uses
one handed signs. Not that this has anything
to do with Glosa, but... it is interesting to
note that there is no international manual
alphabet of sorts. que no?

Hey Jay, I wish I could tell you more about it, but my deaf cousin Anne (who has
some limited auditory capacity yet prefers to use signing for direct
participation in the Deaf community, which she identifies with primarily in
spite of her option to "pass" as an " moderately impaired normal," and more
power to her!) is a natural at learning languages, but they are all sign
languages (A-ha! - what's the neurolgy behind _that_, I wonder? - same
as/different from mental processes of gifted spoken or written language
prodigies?) has told me about an "Interlingua" of signed languages she is
evangelizing for, that is based (like Interlingua) on signs and gestural syntax
patterns common to the largest Deaf communities globally (insofar as it is
possible) and named - at last! - its name at last! - "Gestuno" - a clever
coinage, si? - but that's as much as I know about it.  It seems to be fairly
contemporary in the sense that it has inspired a "cult" of sorts, that has
access to books with the signs the hybrid system uses, which supports a network
of practicioners in the Americas (at least) who maintain written contacts with
one another (online and intermittent newsletters,) as of last summer in any
case, when I learned of it from her.  Maybe further info can be gleaned by a
search engine poke at the embers ... I would have followed up on it myself, but
as usual my plate is 'way too full!  Happy hunting, if you are so inclined, and
until next time, keep the faith with your Interlingua site and email list! -
With best regards, Joseph Carson

I saw the Gestuno book in a library once some years ago, but there were only about

The Gestuno alphabet is just like the American one, hence:
http://where.com/scott.net/asl/abc.html

An alphabet for signed Esperanto seems to exist at: http://abc.signuno.com


(BTW, although interesting, I don't think talk of sign is in the scope of this Glosa
list.)

I think that auxlangs must have own answer on the question: Why I must learn
the language? For example:
Esperanto: Has many adepts in all over the world.
Interlingua: If you want learn any European language, you should learn
Interlingua.
Loglan: You can test Sapir-Worrf hypnotise. And your world view  without
restrictions of your native language.
And Glosa: ????????????????????
If we don't find the answer our language has not chance in the future IAL's
committee.
Saluta,
Alex from Russia.

Glosa claims to have no inflexions.  Isn't 'ge-' a past participle
prefix as in German?  Isn't such a prefix an inflexion?

Middle English had this inflexion (actually y- or i-, e.g. "Sumer
is i-cumen in", where there is a past participle prefix and a past
participle suffix as in "gekommen").

Since all germanic languages except the notoriously primitive
modern German have abandoned it it's queer to see it return in
an IAL.  Why is such a strangely reactionary inflexion
needed?  Is there an alternative, i.e. can it be dispensed with?

Look at "plu".  It says, the following word is plural.  If we would
write it with an hyphen ("plu-feli" instead of "plu feli"), then we
have another prefix/inflexion.  You do not want "ge-"?  Take "ge "!

The "no-inflexions-no-grammar"-purism is important to those who want
mainly a curiosity ("Oh, a language without inflexions. How
bizarre!").  Glosa's destination must be higher.

Anyway, primitive is *good* for a 2nd language!

Imagine an auxlang based on Germanic roots rather
than the notoriously boring Greek and Latin.
English/Afrikaans syntax, sorta like Glosa.

German was too innovative in the area of sound changes
from the earlier common Germanic. Let's reverse the English
sound changes (i.e. use instead some kinda Scottish),
and use the spelling system of the 1600s.

All Nouns must be capitalized, and the final "silent" -e
Grapheme must be pronounced as it was before, as a Schwa.
We should also reinstate the Saxon's Plural since it fits
so well into the adj-noun Order of Things.

Since the Vowels do not mean much of Anything, as in
Gode's Interlingua, we will have no Need to terminate
every Word with a silly romantic Vowel.

As for modern Terminology, we simply adopt all
such Terms as they are used today in Iceland.
As for its Name, it should give an Impression
of reformed hypermodern retro-English.

Sounds like a Winner!

I usually don't post here because I have let my Glosa get so rusty it's
useless and probably won't get better until someone makes a hard copy
dictionary.  But I have to ask: since when do we judge languages are
"primative?"  Primative by what standard?

This is obvious ethnocentricism.  Makes me sad.

You must be joking otherwise what doesn't amount

Bruce Gilson can tell you about some Germanic
Auxlangs. I for one don't see the internationality
of going North Germanic, sounds an awful lot
like the WeDe (Welt Deutsch) of the Nazis.

You misunderstand me.  I didn't say it was bad, but that it hadn't
evolved.  Like Icelandic (which presumably also retains the past
participle prefix) it has avoided the evolution that has
simplified the grammar of English, Dutch and the Skandinavian
languages.

It has cases/declensions, conjugations, grammatical gender and
other trappings of an ancient language.  Such languages, because
of their grammatical complexity, are difficult to learn.  Charles
is obviously joking when he says primitive is good in a 2nd
language.

Still, I didn't mean 'primitive' in a pejorative sense.  I was
asking why Glosa or any modern IAL would revive a particle which
disappeared 600 years ago from the inventors' language.

It is amazingly easy to write things that seem clear as to attitude,
which are then misunderstood and lead to argument. Maybe we need
to use "attitudinal" particles as in Lojban. But I find them
as distasteful as smileys :(

You correctly identified my attempt at humor, but I was also
refering to the difficulty most adults experience learning a language.
So I hijack the word "primitive" to mean "cleverly simple",
as in Lingua Franca or Chinook Jargon or etc.

Glosa has adopted a creole style of syntax, which Occidental's
author also saw as the syntax of the future (though he did not
think it acceptable to eurolang-speakers of his time).

I agree that the fewer complications, the better the language.
Glosa's set of "-bo" "-pe" etc suffixes offend me.
Perhaps it would be better simply not to use them?

That might be the beginning of a response to Alexander
E. Kirpichev, whose question remains unanswered: what is the
distinctive advantage of Glosa compared with other IALs, and why
is it worthwhile to learn it?

I too would be interested in a complete answer.  In "The Loom of
Language", Bodmer/Hogben claim that all planned languages up to
Novial (the latest, to them) are distinctly inferior to English as
an IAL, but that one distinctly better than English is possible,
and, it is hinted, is coming.

On the first point, their arguments and language, when discussing
particular IALs, do not inspire enormous confidence in their
intellectual integrity.  Or maybe I should just say, the debunking
sometimes misses its mark or is thin and dubious, and cumulatively
the treatment makes one suspect that a covert advocacy is going
on.

On the second, Interglossa is a failed language, abandoned by
Hogben.  This suggests that it was not a decisive improvement over
its predecessors.  Was it, or is Glosa, such at distinct
improvement as to make good the second part of the claim?  If so,
how?

Michael Talbot-Wilson

> what is the distinctive advantage of Glosa compared with other IALs,
> and why is it worthwhile to learn it?

I have tried them all. They are all too hard to learn but one,
and that one may vary for each person. Language is inherently
and inescapably *very* difficult. Even one's native language
in which a lifetime of practice is invested, even that language
fails to express what we really mean, and is not clearly
understood even when crafted by the best speakers and writers.

Many of the best minds have attacked the problem of designing
a better vehicle for thought and international communication.
Descartes, Leibniz, Plato, Lao-Tse(!), Jesperson, Saussure;
philosophers, logicians, mathematicians, linguists.
They cast a small light among giant shadows ...

But we could all benefit greatly from a practical auxlang
right now. This is the critical moment in history, and we
are divided (and conquered, i.e. politically controlled)
in uselessly competing/conflicting ethnic/language factions
just at the point where global cooperation and understanding
is most needed. Small world, huge danger!

English isn't working to solve this problem of division,
there are too many barriers, in its archaic spelling that
not even its native children can master, its widely variant
pronunciation non-standards, its heavy reliance on idioms,
its myriad subtleties of word connotations.

A few auxlang ideas seem to work well. My own favorites are
Ido, Glosa, and Occidental, but none is best in all respects.
Boiled down to a few technical points:

* light part-of-speech marking
* small but powerful set of roots
* subject-verb-object phrase order
* consistent affixes/compounds
* mostly CV, no consonant clusters
* recognizable mnemonic vocabulary
* few rules and no exceptions

I've been able to successfully read/write/speak only Occidental.
It can be understood by the Novial/Ido/Interlingua people,
so I had hoped for unification there ... But minor details
often separate more effectively than major ones, it seems,
because mankind is unkind, quarrelsome and short-sighted.

> In "The Loom of Language", Bodmer/Hogben claim

> their arguments and language, when discussing
> particular IALs, do not inspire enormous confidence

Also, Mario Pei's "One Language for the World" was a major
influence on me. I agree that their arguments were leaky.
But they certainly inspired a lot of people (I think) in the
right direction. Today we understand more about how people
learn language, and it is clear that pidgin/creole languages
*are* the easiest for adults to learn, and that they are
sufficient in expressive/communicative power/efficiency.

Most people hate grammar, with a passion. Hogben and his
anointed successors have produced the least grammar-bound of
auxlangs. Glosa really should win therefore, unless it were
cluttered with unneeded frills and sloppy vocabulary, and was
not published in the one obvious place and manner (the WWW).

If people began to use such an auxlang in an actual ongoing
global speech community via the internet, a rapid convergence
would occur to purify the language beyond any individual's
ability to design it. Snowball on hill or in hell?

> Interglossa is a failed language, abandoned by Hogben.
> This suggests that it was not a decisive improvement

Lingua Franca *did* work for approximately a millenium.
I think the key is to discover the language, not create it.
Research into creoles, and the interlinguistics experiments
of the 1900's, all seem to point back to the LF approach.

I think Glosa is dying, despite so much interest and potential;
then a new project along these same lines might succeed.
Or else wait for machine translation, or use Occidental now.
I would like to see Wendy relinquish control of Glosa now to
someone more dynamic and visionary, who would open-source it;
maybe this list-owner, for instance. Glosa needs a version 3.

Languages don't evolve; they change.  This change is neither an
improvement nor a debasement.

I suspect that the ge- prefix (and I agree that it's a prefix; nonsense to
say a language without grammar -- it's like saying "a skeleton without
bones") comes from gene, the verb most often used in passive
constructions.  This is easy enough to remember.

You mean an ancient language like Chinese, or Hawaiian, or . . . wait,
none of those have cases, conjugations, or other "trappings."

In truth, I doubt that a lack of declensions improves the learning curve
all that much.  For every noun case you absolish, you provide a
preposition or word order rule that must be learned.  We simply are more
used to showing case with prepositions than with declension -- so it seems
easier to us.  The very definition of ethnocentrism.

1.  Perhaps the ge- doesn't come from that particle, but from a
contraction of gene.
2.  It's easier to provide some particle to show participial relationships
than to make rules for circumlocution of participles.  The particle ge-
disappeared from most germanic languages because the participle was often
adequately marked alreay witha  suffix.

Dear Jay,

I was wondering if you would direct me to an example of the Nazi-promoted
"WeDe"-sprache of the interwar years in Europe.  The one commendable use for
it I'd heard of was the bridge it could provide for speakers of Plutdietsch or
any of the other hybridizations of "pure" German used in Europe, Russia,
Canada, Australia, Africa, America and South America at the time, and help to
consolidate 'Aryan' identity on a global scale.  This 'Aryan' consciousness
part is deplorable, of course, but the dream of an Ursprache to reunite all
the scattered speakers of Proto-Teutonic in the pre-Christian era of Europe's
history is an attractive one.  If Bruce Gilson is your "expert" of choice in
this regard, is it possible to get a web-link to his home page, for further
investigation?  Thanks for mentioning "WeDe" in any case; it will stimulate
follow-up elsewhere on this subject again at least, so til next time, With

I quite agree that the changes that happen to a language over time
are totally devoid of moral significance.  I'm not absolutely
certain that they are without aesthetic significance, but it is
fruitless to discuss the point.  I'm not sure what else you might
mean by "improvement or debasement".  A language may be improved
in a particular pragmatic sense, e.g. improved for ease of
learning, by such changes.  I tried to make it clear that I did
not regard being primitive, or the reverse, as being either
improved or debased in any moral or comprehensive sense.

But philologists (I am told - don't mistake me for one) suffer
from the delusion that the changes that happen in a language over
time are not quite random, but on the whole move in particular
directions as time passes.  They think they have identified
characteristic changes which can be found in all languages.
Under the influence of this delusion they successfully predicted
the character of proto-Greek before Linear B had been deciphered.

It seems not totally unreasonable to refer to the changes that are
characteristically associated with the forward direction of time
as "evolution".

No.  I mean one that has not evolved as far as modern Chinese.
In fact ancient Chinese writings have complex grammar.

I suggest that you read Bodmer's "The Loom of Language".  I don't
think you quite appreciate the reality.

Word order is not a problem in languages that have shed such
complexities.  It isn't something that has to be learned, it is
the only way you can do it.  Or to put it in another way, you can
order words in any way that works, although some ways may be more
popular with native speakers.  English, French, Ido and Glosa all
have a similar word order.  German is totally different, and in
classical Latin such a thing hardly exists.

> > 	Til seint Iame beo i-souht   that I schal a-signe,

While I'm waxing lyrical (I'll recover in a minute), probably the
best remembered and loved example of the y-, i- prefix is in
Chaucer's description of the Wife of Bath,

	Upon an amblere esily she sat,
	Ywympled wel, and on hir heed an hat

And now, as someone has already said (in a funny word order), this
is way off topic, and I'm bowing out.

In which case, what's your objection to the ge- again?

The changes in a language are not, by any means, random.  Do not, however,
take this fact and run with it to asume that there are, in fact,
characteristic changes "which can be found in all languages."  We were
able to determine the character of prot-Greek because we're quite familiar
with the processes of linguistic change in Indo-European languages -- but
apply the same set of sound changes that have affected, say, Greek, to,
say, German, and you'll end up with something incomprehensible to both.

> It seems not totally unreasonable to refer to the changes that are

Most people hold connotations of improvement in their definitions of
"evolution," but okay, assume not.  My point is, languages do not "evolve"
toward greater simplicity any more than they evolve toward greater
complexity.  They merely change.  After all, Old English was a *lot* more
regular than modern English -- just as Latin had more case endings than
Spanish.

> > > It has cases/declensions, conjugations, grammatical gender and

Let me also point out that Finnish is hardly an ancient language, and it
has all of the above.  You've got this strange linear view of history that
simply isn't tenable.  Most Indo-European languages have tended to drop
their declensions -- but that doesn't mean this is a universal through all
language groups.

Again you have this sense of forward movement that *simply isn't there*.
Languages don't evolve "far" or "not as far."  They change.  Period.

Pray share with me what reality that might be.  I'm three hours from a
good university library right now, and can't get the article.

"it isn't something that has to be learned."  Surely you can see the plain
stupidity of that statement?  Chompskian linguistics aside (far aside,
please), it's obvious that *all language is arbitrary* and therefore *all
language must be learned.*  This includes word order, declensions,
orthography, phonology, and all the nicities of grammar and structure that
you find so "primative."  Glosa is easier than natural language not
because it lacks declensions, but because it is *completely regular*.
Therefore, learning one rule is good enough for every word.

Let's try an example.  In Latin, the genitive of a noun ending in -us is
-i (assuming of course it's masc. -- there's a class of neuter nouns in
-us whose rules sometimes differ).  In Glosa, the genitive of a noun is
formed by prefixing the preposition [de].  Now, if all Latin nouns ended
in -us, and all Latin nouns formed their genitives by adding -i, then why
would that be inherently any harder to remember than the preposition "de"?
It simply would not.

The only reason you find languages with decleensions "harder" is the fact
that they are foreign to you.  This is ethnocentrism.  And the fact that
you consider languages with characteristics of your native language to be
more "evolved" than other languages is pure chauvinism.

    There definitely could be something in it for all of us.


    Sign Language has progressed far beyond the simplicity of spelling on your fingers, and could in fact be the most suitable a-cultural medium for communication across the cultures.


    In a similar vein is the new Langenscheidt's PICTURE TALK - Global Communication at Your Fingertips.  This is a small, pocket-book for the traveller who passes through many lands: the book has no words, and not even any page-numbers - because these would imply a cultural bias; instead, it has pictures grouped wiith things and situations you might wish to communicateover, during your travels: the communication is achieved by fingering the relevant picture and making the right associated gesture, pointing, questioning, angst, beckoning, etc.


   It's all going non-verbal and non-literal, folks!


   Signed communication can never reach the speed of reading, but would be comparable with the speed of speaking; and using the "Picture Talk" as a prop for communication might be a shade slower, again, but would get you out of tricky situation, with virtually no learning curve, and no need for specialised linguistic ability.


   Where does Glosa fit into this scenario?  The learning of a 2000 sign vocabulary could be comparable with getting the Glosa basic vocabulary under your belt, and the learning curve for using Glosa's syntax might be comparable with doing the same thing for signing's sytax and inflection.  However both Glosa and signing require the two people, in the communication pair, to be reasonably fluent in the communication system.  With Glosa, one can make up and deliver sentences, while checking for the odd unknown word from the dictionary .. similar to hunting for the right pictures in Picture Talk.

   And, of course Glosa has the advantage over signing, that a person can communicate across space by using a telephone, and across time with by using written notes.


   Perhaps in some future time the seasoned traveller will learn Glosa (or whatever the IAL is) and signing, and use one or the other dependiing on the skills of the person with whom he wishes to communicate; but also, he would carry a picture book to allow him to communicate with people who had neither literacy or signing.


Saluta,

> The learning of a 2000 sign vocabulary

I have never seen an auxlang basic vocabulary with
less than a 1300 or more than 5000 roots.
Gode's dictionary of 27000 words has around 5000 roots,
same as the Occidental Radicarium or Novial Lexike.
Adam Kilgariff's lemma-list for 93% English coverage
has 6000 items of which not all are roots.

It should be possible to merge a few of these lists
and have a sure-fire effective and practical vocabulary.
The equivalent roots can be added for a number of auxlangs,
particularly Glosa, which most desperately needs a
systematic full vocab. All synonyms should be included.

Then out of the full list of 6000, it should be apparent
that some roots are far more essential than others.
They could be scored by frequency of usage and stratified
into "top 1000", "basic 2500", and "full 6000".
In basic lists the less-favored synonyms can be dropped.

This would be an achievable and valuable project,
and could be shared among several auxlangs, I imagine.
It is a killing task for 1 person, but if several people
would work together it can be done in a short time.
Anybody here interested? Any ideas for improvements?

Glosa roots (= words, usually) tend to a CVCV pattern
with the final vowel being meaningless 99% of the time.
Lingua Franca also had meaningless Romance euphonious
or etymological final vowels that were insignificant.
Ido roots are easily obtained by removing their final
part-of-speech vowel or verbal -ar suffixes.

So as an example, the English word "basket" is 3983th
in frequency in the Kilgariff list. Even if Glosa had
no previously defined word for it, one could easily be
found in LF or Ido, but actually Glosa has 2 of them.
So, I would like to have a table of Kilgariff roots
crossed with auxlangs sorta like so:

Kilga   LF     Glosa        Ido   Novial  Occid  Latin
basket  gorba  korba,mirso  korb  korb    corb   corbis

There might be a fair number of roots present in Glosa that
do *not* appear in K's list. Of course they would all be added
as well. What I am proposing is like Rick Harrison's list,
http://www.geocities.com/Athens/5383/uld2in.html
which should also be merged into this root table/database.
I think his other list is entirely subsumed by K's,
but might help define the "basic" vocab subset.
http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html

Having such a list available on the web would *not* violate
anyone's copyright etc. It *might* lead to a convergence.
At least it would be interesting, and *useful* in filling
the gaps in our favorite auxlangs or conlangs.

I see no evidence that the ge- is unnecessary.  It helps to avoid
ambiguity -- much like the ambiguity of your second sentence.

Incidently, _The Loom of Language_ is 56 years out of date and written by
an amateur.  You might do well to take your facts from something written
within the decade, at least, and by an expert.

It is easy to say that.  You are pretending to be an expert when
on all the evidence of this exchange to date you don't know a bee
from a bull's foot on the subject.  You are totally ignorant.  At
least, that is the only conclusion possible from what you have
written.  You have disclosed absolutely nothing but hostility and
phoney pretence.

Yet every current scholar on the subject (at least, every current
reputable scholar on the subject -- that weirdo who thinks Basque is made
of English anagrams might think otherwise) holds that languages do not
change in any universal direction.  They do not become more isolated, or
more inflected, over time.  In fact, inflected languages tend to become
isolated languages, and isolated languages tend to become agglutinative
and then inflected.

Your argument against the Glosa ge- is unfounded, absurd, and completely
ridiculous.  You hve not addressed any point at all which I have raised.
My perfectly good argument that inflected languages are not harder to
learn, inherently, than isolating languages was ignored -- insted you told
me to read a book which, upon examination, consists of amateur linguistic
sketches (with numerous errors) and a typically mid-century attitude long
since abandoned by every serious scholar in the field of linguistics.

There are plenty of perfectly good objections to Glosa (for instance, I
personally think that  alanguage without ambiguity is a language without
poetry, and if a language lacks poetry -- it is useless [of course, having
translated a tiny bit of poetry into Glosa, I must say the language *does*
contain ambiguity, despite assertions to the otherwise]).  But the
objection to the ge- prefix on the grounds that it's unnecessary (yes,
technically, any one feature of language can be circumlocuted -- skimmed
an interesting book on the topic once, reducing language to a set of fifty
[I think] primatives) lacks merit.  The use of ge- allows the flexibility
of the passive voice, a technique that permits the poetic ambiguity above
mentioned.  Your further argument that ge- comes from German and is
therefore bad is completely baffling.  First, I see no evidence other than
coincidence of form that ge- comes from the similar Germanic preffix.
Second, I see no reason why adopting, even if it did come from such an
origin, a handy participial prefix is bad.  Your attitude puzzles me, your
arguments baffle me, and your sources tickle me.

Incidently, it is only "pretense" if I do not, in fact, have the education
I imply.  Since I have a MA and am working on my PhD, I don't think it's
technically pretense.  Hauteur, maybe, pretense, no.

Ido made the 2 most necessary improvements to Esperanto,
eliminating the goofy circumflexed consonants, and using
more naturalistic-looking roots. Here is a great URL:

http://geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/

Esperanto is not so popular as its propaganda claims.
Nearly everybody tries to learn it, fails and quits,
losing faith in the idea of an IAL. Very bad result!
All other IALs are superior technically to Esperanto.
But I like very much the idealism of Zamenhoff, and
the nice sense of community that Esperantists promote.

Occidental is even much better than Ido, because
it uses more naturalistic affixes as well as roots.
De Wahl proved that Ido is not so "scientific" as it claims,
and replaced its false-logic with a truer psychological logic.
The thing that works best for me is the analytic verb
phrase structure in Occidental, modeled on Lingua Franca.

Today it may be possible to improve IAL design by study
of creolistics. Perhaps now a more radical design would
be acceptable to western Europeans and Americans.

Glosa has the right basic syntax, again like Lingua Franca;
I believe that "analytical" is the right way to go for a
global auxlang, though no disrespect is intended toward
"synthetic" Russian and other great cultural languages,
they just don't serve well as auxlangs (nor does English).

You are irrelevantly extending the universe of discussion.  I am
very well aware of this fact.  (I found it out from "The Loom of
Language", which discusses the discovery of it in Indian
languages.)  But what might happen afterwards, to English or
Chinese, is irrelevant to the fact of the retention of an antique
inflexion in Glosa, one which provably is unnecessary because most
Germanic languages have dropped it.

You have now, though, accidentally, admitted that there is
directed evolution, the fact you have been trying to deny.  Why
have you created an argument on the point, when the most you can
now say is that the evolution is cyclic?

> Your argument against the Glosa ge- is unfounded, absurd, and completely

Why should I address any point you raised, when you cited no
documents and did not say you had any credentials on your own
account?  Why should I address myself to crap challenges?  The
best you could do was, when I had cited a source, express your
precious contempt for it.  You cited nothing better, nothing more
modern.  You contributed nothing.

I can trust you to be right on that, of course?  What would you
know about serious scholars in the field of linguistics?

You insinuate, without clearly saying, that you have examined the
book I mentioned.  "Upon examination"?  Whose?  You still need to
read it.

"Perfectly good"??  The issue is in part the number of forms of
the noun, or the verb, that have to be memorised.  I am not going
to quote extensively.  Read it.  Read about the number of forms
for the finite verb in Sanscrit, Greek, Latin and English.  The
numbers drop from staggeringly large to insignificant.  The
problem with inflexions is first that you have to memorise them,
and second that the systems of classification invented by
grammarians, such as some small number of declensions or
conjugations, is artificial.  The language in the wild is much
less regular.  If Bodmer is right, no-one for centuries has
studied classical Latin.  At least at school, in non-specialist
courses.  What is studied is an artificial simplification.  The
real language did not have the regularity of the noun and verb and
adjective classifications that are taught.  Overwhelmingly, in
Latin, and even more so in ancient Greek and Sanscrit a set of
case endings is unique to a particular noun, and correspondingly
for verbs.

Your perfectly good argument that inflected languages are not more
difficult to learn, Haw haw.

The internet dictionary project of W. Patterson/ R. Gaskell/ P.
Bartlett (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) goes in that
direction.  Let us improve this one before starting another
project.

This may be helpful.  My suggestion for strategy:

You certainly know Interlingua de Peano/ Latino sine flexione
(see www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/2948/).  It is a direct
forerunner of Glosa and nearly the same as Glosa.  Main difference:
Glosa has a limited (= good) but unsatisfying vocabulary.  Interlingua
has no own vocabulary.  It uses the Latin one and a simple word
derivation scheme instead.  With this scheme, - a bit refined -, we
could improve Glosa words.

Examples:
  Glosa words: "silva" and "silvi" for forest, wood
  Latin:       silva, ae, f., ablativus silva, then ...:
  Peano:       silva
  --->         "silva" is good, "silvi" is bad and should be
                 eliminated.
(I started to make a list of those bad synonyms, will post them later
for discussion.)

If Peano leads to a bad result (for example "flexione" has too many
syllables), prefer the shortest old Glosa word or the best solution of
other IALs.

 > Glosa roots (= words, usually) tend to a CVCV pattern
 > with the final vowel being meaningless 99% of the time.

I agree.  This is very important!  But do not kill all of them.
"silv" would be harder to speak (consonant cluster with the following
word), harder to understand by listening and sounds uglier.

As long as we do *something* about it, anything, I will be happy.
There hasn't been any effort since Robin's latest M$ crash.
It is impossible for any person to do alone, but ideal for
a community-effort project to resusitate Glosa.

This is a great idea! I never thought of LsF as similar to Glosa.

Cleanup of errant/variant final vowels should be done, and clearly
you do have the ability to accomplish that. Then we would have
a clean Glosa 6000 to analyze further (as planned a year or 2 ago).

I think a bare root really is CVC (silv-) but the word *does* need
a euphonious and etymologically plausible vowel final (silvA).
Most of the world strongly prefers or requires CVCV words.

What I much *dislike* is the use of final vowels to differentiate
meanings, e.g. "bale=ballet, bali=throw". That's a big mistake,
fortunately there are not very many of those in the current vocab.
If one forgets the correct final, which is so very easy to do,
it should *not* matter. Since the finals are unstressed, nobody can
hear the difference between "bale/bali" in actual speech anyway.
Besides, I hate ballet ... and to me "baila=dance" (from Spanish).

Germanic languages still mark the participle; they just do not do so with
the prefix ge-.  Why don't you understand this?

Why is it harder to learn -us -> -i (assuming such to be regular among all
classes of nouns) than "de"?  It's not.  And all you can do is attack me

I have an MA in English.  You had only to ask; that's hardly "prising" it

Let's not do that here. Flame wars are unhealthy.

My argument was with your ideas, not you personally.  Instead of

Here, let's be mo0re constructive: what if you had absolute control over
Glosa?  How would you mark the participle, if not with ge-?

    I have just rejoined the list after a lengthy absence.
Unfortunately, the first few posts I received just today seem
to be a bit of a flame war, and that is disheartening.

    In any event, I do have some catching up to do.  I have downloaded
the archive of messages but at the moment am only up to early April in
reading them, and hastily at that.  Perhaps someone could kindly fill
me in, by private email if that would be more appropriate.  When I was
last on the list, there was still some discussion of a sort of "Glosa
2500" vocabulary.  Not having yet gone through all the archive, I do
not know that status of that.  However, if there are online resources
in general to which someone could point me, I would be grateful.  (Due
to some pruning of old files, I no longer have a lot of old
references.)  Thanks.

That's not how I remember it.  I don't remember a *question*, but an
assertion and an insult to German.  Perhaps I misunderstood.

In any event, I suspect that ge- cannot be circumvented; a participle
saves massive amounts of time and adds a certain simplicity to the
language that otherwise would be bled away in circumlocutions and
ambiguities.

Patrick, I started out with the reasonable question, whether the
ge- in Glosa could be avoided.  I'm still waiting for an
answer.  You are the one posing as an expert.  You could have
answered the question, perhaps.  A person who really has the
expertise would do better trying to teach, rather than trying to
stalk and make fools of those who do not.

I asked, and all I got from you, in a succession of posts which I
initially answered very mildly, was hostile challenges.

It's a very interesting (troublesome) problem.
Some examples from the well-known web page:

        ge-lose feli               Lost cat
        Id frakti; id pa frakti.   It is breaking; it broke.
        Id pa gene frakti.         It got broken.
        Id es ge-frakti.           It is broken.
        u feli; qi ...             The cat which ...

It looks like the only options would be "ge-" and "qi".
And there's no present participle BTW IINM.

One might be tempted to try "pa-lose feli" and "nu-frakti violina",
but they'd be tough to distinguish from real verb phrases in speech.
With regular words vowel-terminated, maybe -nt and -d, or -nd and -t?
Then, "loset feli" and "fractint violina". Nicer, but not Glosa.

Using a relative clause seems the worst and clumsiest solution,
and I might even prefer to use participles entirely,
replacing all relative clauses, with the side-benefit of
eliminating the *ridiculous* "Semicolon de Hogben".

So maybe the thing to do is keep using "ge-", and justt
add a new particle for the present/active participle??
But they might get mixed up into verb phrases. Oy!!

And, of course, this is the problem with an absolutely analytic language,
at least for me.

One could convey present active participles as adjectives, so:

u feli -- the cat
u skribi feli -- the writing cat

But then, does this perhaps mean "the writing behaves cattishly"?

I can picture that precisely, it is a common occurance:
http://catty.com/~catty/jpg/kt_keybd.jpg

Another temptation is to use the Saxon Genitive, as in
"the cat's writing was incisive". It seems strange that
Hogben so greatly praised Chinese grammar but selected
the euro-genitive preposition "de" instead of the sino-
postposition "de", which is so much more useful,
serving for both relative clauses and genitives.

Interesting.  First Michael wanted to kill "ge-" and the past
participle.  Now we go into the contrarian direction and want to
create a new participle (present participle).  But the argument is
right.  I have the same problems, too.  Three notes from me:

- In German the present participle is normally not used.  It is bad
  style.  But it is available.
- In English the present participle is used more often.  But often it
  is only the sign of the continuous form.  Therefore Glosa has "du".
- My suggestion:
    Try to avoid it!  Else "u skribi feli" is "the writing cat", if
    there is no ambiguity.  Else make a new full sentence "u feli
    skribi e ... " (coordination) or take a prepositional clause like
    "u feli ko skribi akti".

Karo Plu Amika,

  Patrick, which is the ethnocentricism?

  The use of  ~ge-~  in Glosa, or references to the German language?

  On general principles I would find reference to national languages distracting, in Glosa,  however, on occasion, a natlang reference is pertinent.  Ron Clark, originally had imagined that Glosa, like any good science report, would always use the Active Voice.  Subsequently he added the mechanism for creating thhe participle,, which is the mainstay of the Passiive Voice: so, the ~ge~ participle-former is a relative new-comer to Glosa.


  The concept of "primitiveness," for me, takes two forms in language:-

    a. if a language has many featues that are similar to those present when it was first recognised as a distinct language, then it is developmentally relatively primitive; and

    b. if a language has a low level of complexity, then it is organisationally primitive.

  In the case of Glosa, I hark back to the lexical roots, to suggest that, being based on the Classical roots of Greek and Latin, by comparison with the deriivative European languages, it is relatively primative.  As well as that, I would suggest that, although many ethnic languages do feature very complex tenses and inflectional structures, I understand that root-word languages, like Chinese and Glosa, are developmentally and structurally more primitive than are the more inflected languages.


   Good news: the _Glosa 2000_ dictionary is alive and well and available from Richmond, UK.  I bought one two months ago; it is still in new condiition, despite use, and could be sent to you.  Its 12Stg price-tag ammounted to a cost of approx A$20.  If you chose to acqquire mine, I'd sendiit to as soon as you sent your land address.  Then I would buy another from Wendy Ashby at Richmond.  I include here my signature in case you wished to write directly to Wendy, yourself.


Saluta,

    Let me quote from a work of fiction.  It may not be the best
ficion around (nothing on the level of Tolkien), but it may serve
here to illustrate a point.  (I typed this up some time ago.)

=======

    Consider the following excerpt from David Eddings' fantasy novel,
"Domes of Fire" (1992).  Eddings' fantasy series "The Elenium" and its
sequel "The Tamuli" are set in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, medieval
world with the common motifs of chivalry, magic, religion, and so on.
Kalten is a brave and likable, but not always bright, Church Knight of
Elenic language, race, and religion, and the Church Knights are trained
to cast spells using the Styric tongue.  Sephrenia is a polyglot wisewoman
of the Styric race.  In this episode, an Elenic party are in the Tamul
Empire and need to learn to speak Tamul.  Incidentally, linguistic theory
is not my point here.  My point is the misjudgment of considering that
one's own language is somehow the "natural" way that all humans think.

        "Kalten, dear," [Sephrenia] said gently, why was I trying
      to teach you Styric?"
        "So that I could perform magic tricks, I guess."  He
      shrugged.  "That's unless you just enjoy making people
      suffer."
        "No, dear one.  It was just as painful for me as it was for
      you."  She shuddered.  "More painful, probably.  You _were_,
      in fact, trying to learn Styric so that you could work the
      spells, but in order to do that, you had to be able to _think_
      in Styric.  You can't just mouth the words and make them come
      off the way you want them to."
        "Wait a minute," he objected.  "Are you saying that people
      who speak other languages don't think the same way we do?"
        "They may think the same way, but they don't think in the
      same words."
        "Do you mean to say that we actually think in words?"
        "Of course we do.  What did you think thoughts were?"
        "I don't know.  But we're all human.  Wouldn't we all think
      in the same way and in the same language?"
        She blinked.  "And which language would that be, dear one?"
        "Elenic, naturally.  That's why foreigners aren't as clever
      as we are.  They have to stop and translate their thoughts from
      Elenic into that barbarian gabble they call language.  They do
      it just to be stubborn, of course."
        She stared at him suspiciously.  "You're actually serious,
      aren't you?"
        "Of course.  I thought everybody knew that's why Elenes are
      smarter than everybody else."  His face shone with blinding
      sincerity.
        "Oh, dear," she sighed in near despair,

=======

    Sorry, Robin, but I just can't agree that "of the Planned
Languages, Glosa is the closest to the Language of Thought."

That's just *morphology*, i.e. suffixes and prefixes
in a thin disquise, eliminating Glosa's claim to fame.
(I'm not counting word-compounding as morphology.)
There is no other well-known creole-like auxlang, that's
my interest in Glosa (perhaps Lingua Franca can be revived).

As a set of word-building affixes, the "bo-" set are clearly
inferior to those of the other auxlangs, Ido for instance.
They do not add anything to expressivity, but increase
complexity and the all-important difficulty of learning.
Far better to drop them and use plain compounds, I think.

If there must be morphology in Glosa, I would prefer
participles or some such useful things. But that would
be like a surrender of principles, not a good direction.

But part and parcel of Glosa is its word economy.
The original Interglossa idea was to use a minimum
set of roots as in Basic English but derive these from
Greek, or mainly from Greek and then assisted by Latin.
The fact that there are more Latin roots in Glosa is the
work of Ashby and Clark.

Eventually the dual feature of some roots, having both
Greek and Latin roots as synonyms, will catch up with
usage and a preferred root would be used more than the
other.

I do agree that 1000 words is just bare minimum. And
1200 to 2500 words would be more usable; also the
Glosa 6000 would need weeding out and more work
done on compounding for the sake of adding terms
to the wordlists instead.

Since,
Jay B.

This isn't an attempt to knock Glosa.  I'm just trying to clutch
at the spirit of it, grasp what it is all about, see if there is
something in there that is really the way forward.  It is a later
invention than Ido: is it based on a fundamentally better
approach, and does it show?

Is it, for example, easier to learn?  Are creoles and pigins
really easy to learn, or are they just an unsophisticated
compromise?  Do they work well, or do they just allow people to
get by after a fashion?  Are they just where you finish up when
improvising across a language barrier?  If so, does that fact mean
they are easy, or just minimal?  Is minimal good, or just limited?

Is Chinese really easy to learn? Issues relating to Chinese may
include (a) there are too many words; (b) grammatical
simplification was accompanied by great elaboration of idiomatic
phraseology.  Has such a set of helper phrases (presumably a few
thousand of them) been provided for Glosa?

On ease of learning of Glosa, the most conspicuous piece of
evidence that I have discovered is that the discussions in this
list are carried on in English and not Glosa.  If there were
simply a FAQ in English posted here regularly, and the actual
discussions took place in Glosa itself, I'd be more hopeful that
the language had something going for it.

Does it take 60 years to invent or instinctively create a pidgin
or creole?  Why, nearly 60 years after Hogben's publication, are
we doubtfully trying to work out how to speak of a writing cat, or
a writing person?  How many people use this language in real
communication, for example, internationally?  What meetings have
taken place in which the proceedings were entirely in Glosa?

One of Hogben's key insights, or so he thought, concerned the
importance of word economy, as exemplified by Basic English.  The
thing that takes so long in learning a language is acquiring the
words.  The only criticism he has of Peano's Interlingua was that
there were too many words.  It met his approval in having little
grammar.

It should therefore be possible to carry on written discussions in
Glosa using just the vocabulary of 1000 or so words that Robin or
someone else has already put up on the net and which I printed out
one time.  I'd like to see you experienced Glosa people doing
that.

I have tried as a rank beginner, with rather little success.  I
could only guess and hope that the accumulation of words was
intelligible.  It seems that because there is little formal
grammar there is no formal sentence.  There is nothing you can
analyse and determine to be a complete sentence, and therefore a
verifiably complete and verifiably intelligible communication of a
thought.  Whereas a rank beginner in Ido has no difficulty in
creating a sentence.

And that language is the normal medium of communication among
students of it.  And the root+suffix system is a reasonable
response to the word-economy issue.  That's why Zamenhof adopted
it in Esperanto.

On ease of use and ease of learning, Glosa does not even seem to
be in the game.  Therefore, what are we doing here?  Is it just a
matter of loyalty, of irrational attachment?

I've looked around on the Internet trying to find what is the key
advantage of Glosa relative to other IALs.  As I understand it,
the key claim is that it has no inflexions, genders, "or
diacritics" (!).  And that it has special words (rather than
inflexions) to signify the plural.  That is the key claim, and
presumably is supposed to be the key advantage.  Is it an
advantage?  We have seen (and we are seeing above) that Glosa has
proceded to acquire inflexions.  Interlingua also acquired
grammar.

Glosa seems to be a language that after nearly 60 years of
development, four times as long as any other IAL, has not reached
the point of being usable, and is not used.  Is this a fair
assessment, or am I being unreasonable, or clueless?

I can understand that it might be of interest to students of
language, of linguistics, as an object of experiment.  Is this the
real purpose of Glosa?

A toy for linguists I can understand and sympathise with.  Of
course, that would be a specialist tool that the rest of us would
be ill-advised to waste our time with.

Michael Talbot-Wilson

Yes, especially for adults who are not linguistically talented.
Adult 2nd-language-learners are *the* market for any true IAL.
For over 800 years there was a perfectly acceptable one
in actual use all aroung the Mediterranean, and it probably
spawned most of the other creoles such as Tok Pisin.
It was the Lingua Franca, based on Occitan/Italian/Catalan,
with a structure very like ... Glosa.

By using Latin synonyms and having a better dictionary,
people might write more in Glosa. I can do it easily enough
in Occidental, and without suffixes it gets even easier.
That does put a mighty heavy load on word-compounding ...

Because I like griping a lot. With such a minimal grammar,
any mistakes really stand out ... I think Glosa is still
one major revision away from success. But it should work,
because the Lingua Franca did. There were only a few
years of design, during the 1940's and the 1970's.

> It should therefore be possible to carry on written discussions in

No way! 1000 is too few. Glosa has 1800 published on the web,
another 4000 in the "deluxe edition". Not all were well-chosen,
but if users felt free to expand the vocabulary, then in a
year or two (I think) it *would* rapidly evolve to usability.
The authors have choked their baby by holding it too tight
(and making it speak mangled Greek instead of vulgar Latin).

> It seems that because there is little formal

1. u/plu (ADJ) NOUN es/pa/nu/etc VERB u/plu (ADJ) NOUN

2. add prepositional phrases after nouns

That's enough! Adding more features just makes it worse.

Yes, but I'm trying to grasp how effective Lingua Franca was,
whether a bare facilitator of cross-cultural communication, or a
flexible language which could facilate, for example, precise
explication of a theory.

I'm slightly doubtful that LF spawned Tok Pisin.

If my understanding is correct, LF has been lost and its detailed
structure is a matter of speculation.  It had a simpler grammar
than French (though it called itself the French language).  But
was it as grammatically simple as the ideal creole or pidgin?

There are other IALs with stuctures like those of Catalan and
Italian, greatly simplified.

A set of rules that work both ways from Greek roots to Glosa words and
back again automatically turns any classical Greek dictionary into a Glosa
dictionary.

Now, if someone would just *tablulate* such rules, we could begin coining
words left and right.

*   Phew!
    I will answer the two main questions in one piece.
    I do apologise to all, but with civilisation under threat, I have had
to 'de-prioritise' the Glosa work.

    The quick, and nasty, answer is that learning Glosa is not useful, at
present.  I have written three fairy stories into Glosa, and Wendy has
written one.  There is no body of Glosa literature, neither translations or
originals.  It is as if Glosa has got stuck at the "work in progress" stage.
    However, the nicer answer is that Glosa offers a promise of ready
communication .. especially at the technical level, but also, it can be
used with a distinctly human feel.  The 'promise' has not been taken up -
in a world hell-bent on conspicuous consumption and a self-destructive,
aggressive competition for what is left of the Planet's resources.  There
seems no time for people to contemplate ideas that are simply worthwhile,
but not immediately profitable.

    While I cannot speak for Bodmer and Hogben, nor for their 'scathing'
attitude towards other auxlangs, I can say, from my discussions with Ron
Clark, that he never published any critical comment about other designed
languages.

    The language Hogben hined at was obviously Interglossa; however, he
found that no-one was interested in his simple language in Post-War Europe,
so he stopped worrying about solving the problem of global scientific
communication, and the Cold War rift did not help, either.

    So the hard thing to say is that Glosa, which is even simpler,
morphologically, than Interglossa, has a very valuable part to play in our
'globalising' (with a little "G") world.
    The Internet cries out for a single 'international' communication
medium, and Glosa could rapidly become it.  Had Bill Gates acquired Glosa,
by now, all PCs would be carrying Glosa parsers in their operating systems.
 When it comes to man-machine intefaces, with meta-languages acting as the
interface media, Glosa would fit in perfectly.
    Maybe I should sell Glosa to Bill Gates: that would solve financial
problems for Wendy and me; and would cut the competioion dead, in the
distinctive Microsoft way!

     I have recieved letters fron Chinese people, saying Glosa's syntax was
easy for them, because it was about the same as that of Chinese: one sixth
of the problem solved!
     In my discussions with the Chinese Linguist, LIU Haitao, we used a
combination of Glosa and Esperanto - he writing Esperanto, and me Glosa -
and I have to go on record, as saying that I had to translate his Esperanto
into English before I could be sure I knew what he meant.  Haitao had used
Esperanto for a number of years, and could use Glosa quite happily, too;
however, he was lost when he ventured into English.  He did feel that Glosa
had been oversimplified, but I feel he did not give Glosa a fair trial ..
sticking with the Esperanto that he knew.
      Africans I have written to using Glosa, wrote back in good Glosa, and
did not quibble about this usage, or that: I sort of assume they felt the
language was fairly 'natural.'
      Writing scientific reports in Glosa is very dry and very logical:
perhaps Glosa could be described as "techno-speak."
      So, there we go: if the idea of a language being intuitive, and
logical, have any validity, then so has Glosa.  While designing the
'speak-as-you-look-it-up-in-the-dictionary' language, Ron Clark also had
the good sense to ensure that both the appearance and the sound of the
phrasing was pleasant, as well as making sense.
      Regarding the rules, and there is basically only one - a word is
modified by its precedent - Ron was horrified at the thought that learners
should sit down and internalise a grammar book of rules; children certainly
don't.  So Ron decreed that people would speak Glosa without first studying
a Grammar book.  In fact, he virtually banned the idea of producing such a
guide.  This was, perhaps his biggest mistake: he uvastly over-estimated
the initiative that could be shown by those making up the bulk of the human
race.  For research purposes, and against the wishes of Ron and Wendy, I
did set up a tabulation of Glosa's grammar, but this was purely
descriptive, and not prescriptive.
      While this tabulation of Glosa's grammar is in reasonable shape, I
would NOT recommend first 'learning the grammar' so that you could 'apply'
the rules when you spoke or wrote Glosa.  I would follow Ron in suggesting
that learners understood enough of the philosophy behind the language so
they could learn by 'jumping-in-the-deep-end' and
'speaking-as-they-looked-it-up-in-the-dictionary'.

      Sorry about the rambling answers.

     The matter of Glosa's possible superiority over its ccompetitors begs
a question.  It assumes that the present amateur promotions of Planned
Languages represents a valid Darwinian competition in which the 'the
survivor must be the fittest.'
     The evaluation of the situation requires more intelligent thinking:
which language, if adopted to serve as the world's IAL, will most benefit
the human race, this is the correct question.  And such an innovation
begins at Mother's knee, and is followed at the School M'am's desk: so, the
experiment, in which Klaus Lankilde taught Glosa to Middle-School children,
near Atlanta was a runaway success.

     And finally, I do feel that such questions are a waste of my time
answering.  There is a distinct three-strikes-and-you're-out sensation
about it: Lancelot and Ron have been struck out; now we are just waiting to
see how long I can keep batting for, until the innings is over.  We are,
however, still watching to see if Wendy Ashby is going to send in a curly
ball from outfield, to revive the game.

Saluta,
  Robin
    P.S.  Anyone have Bill Gates' phone number?

    With Glosa the Part-of-Speech markers are notably absent, unnecessary,
or missing.  Which, I can't be sure; but, up to now, I have been working on
the premise that the proper placement of a word in a sentence was all the
signposting its function needed.
    There is a chance that owing to a quirk of nature, syntax seems natural
to me, and does not to many others.  On the other hand, nurture could have
played a part - as a result of my learning Parsing and Analysis, as a
primary-school boy, in Queensland.
    The question of Glosa's occasional awkward, consonant-rich words,
mostly of Greek origin, can easily be solved through a deft use of the
culling knife.

    I would like to know which aspect of the language suits your particular

Occidental that made it ^click^ with you?

However, perhaps these facets are two aspects of the one gem;
from my reading of "Interglossa", It did seem that Hogben put more effort
into the organising system than into the philosophy and psychology of human
communication.

    Somehow, the tolerance, shown by the authors, of variation between, and
within, the various dictionaries was not shared by many of the
would-be-learners of Glosa.  Attempts to rationalise the lexicon, through
action on the Internet, only revealed further undiscovered linguistic
confusion; and, as yet, the matter of a solid, complete and unambiguous
Learners Dictionary (slated as _Glosa 2500_) is still in abeyance.

But on the Basic principle, shouldn't it be possible, with that
bare minimum or whatever is on the Net (Charles says it is 1800 -
I didn't count them), to hold these discussions in the
language?  Why are we talking English?

Yes, on the principle of word economy, too many means too many to
learn.  A rule to generate words might not be such a good idea.
(Hogben's criticism of Interlingua de Peano -- too many words.)

Flexible it was, but precise it was not. All the verbs were
marked by -r, which sounds ridiculous now to Romance speakers
but sure made it easy to parse. Plurals in -s, sometimes a
past participle in -t, most other words ended in random vowels.

Science generates its own nomenclature, which is somewhat
international but equally barbaric, e.g. species names
and astronomical designations. An IAL should be at the
service of the common people, plain and common-sensical.
Nothing on Earth is as practical as trade and conquest ...

> I'm slightly doubtful that LF spawned Tok Pisin.

Sailors who spoke it carried it everywhere, like plague.
Development of a creole merely required enslaving diverse
populations and setting brutal ignorant bosses over them,
effectively stifling their use of native languages.
LF provided some vocabulary, universal creolization
processes did the rest. AAUI.

Bickerton described an "ideal" (nobody agrees 100% on this).
It "should" be SVO and rely on particles for tense/aspect/mood,
virtually no flexions or affixes, and minimal vocabulary.

LF was far from ideal, but was as simple as language can be.
It had no fixed structure, but had one criterion (only):
If and when a statement is understood, it is correct.
The ideal language for pirates, slaves, and tourists!

I like the idea of a pure-ideal pidgin/creole as IAL.
To be even easier for European speakers, it should
use Latin roots. Glosa is not so far from that.

(Perhaps as corporate enslavement of the world proceeds,
the conditions for creole formation will return soon?
I listen to 20-year olds speaking, and shudder.)

"evolution" within the study of language.

    Years ago, for suggesting that because of the many invasions, and
imported linguistic influences, on the Isles of Pritan, the English
language had evolved more than most national languages - with the
characteristics of the present spoken language comprising the 'fittest
survivors' of many linguistic battles.

    For suggesting that such 'evolution' could occur, and that an
acceleration of the linguistic evolution process could yield a "more
evolved, and better" language medium, I was jumped on, and resoundingly
flattened!

    When I said that Glosa continued the evolutionary trends seen in
English, and carried them to their conclusions, raspberries and other rude
noises could be heard.

    However, I do not recant!

    Basic English, of course, was/is basically a fraud.  Yes, it had a
list of 850 words, but it used word-groups such as English's highly
notorious phrasal verbs which cannot entirely be decomposed lexically
into their constituents.  Therefore, the actual working set of
functional lexical units which had to be memorized was far greater than
850.

    For the record, I compiled the "Glosa Basic Reference" which was,
and may still be, the primary word list on the world wide web.  I sent
the preliminary version in hard copy to G.E.O. for their consent to put
up.  I had noticed that the printed lists of "Glosa 1000" were not
consistent in their content.  So, using some rudimentary computer
utilities, I collated the lists and added a handful of words (probably
not more than twenty or so) from other Glosa sources.  Then I formatted
it into an HTML document.  Because the only browser I had available at
the time was a little primitive and did not do tables, I adopted the
text-only format that I did.  Because of the way the lists (G-E/E-G)
were structured, I never did count the words exactly, but they were
about 1600.

    Pham Xuan Thai's Lingua Sistemfrater (or just Frater) was rather
Glosa-like but used more Latin roots than Glosa, as best I recall
without digging out my copy.  (And it used only thirteen consonants and
five vowels.)  Actually, I think Hogben was too optimistic in his
assessment of understanding of Greek roots.  A lot of people --
including many of those worldwide who use the "International Scientific
Vocabulary" -- may *use* words with Greek roots more or less as lexical
wholes without thereby having a very good knowledge of what the atomic
roots themselves mean.  Those of us with a modicum of English etymology
and a smattering of Latin and classical Greek may know some of them,
but I suspect that even your average scientist may not know them well.

> I like the idea of a pure-ideal pidgin/creole as IAL.

Using separate words in place of the number inflexion of the noun
or the tense inflexions of the verb seems perfectly obvious and
easy.  But I'm not certain that there is any advantage in it.

That Glosa claims it but doesn't fully do it is a bit strange.
And after Peano, Interlingua grew grammar, also a bit strange.

And regular inflexions are also perfectly obvious and easy.  Isn't
this fact implied by the other one?  Is there any essential
difference?  Isn't is purely a matter of orthography?  If it is
agreed that the "ge-" prefix is an inflexion (is it?), is anything
achieved by making "ge" an autonomous word, and pretending we have
dispensed with inflexions?

Entire avoidance of morphological change in derivation is more
problematic for me.  Do you not lose clarity or precision at this
point, unless supported by numerous traditional phrases?

If I say "Quick!", you need context to begin to know whether I
mean "Come quick!" or "Wasn't that quick!".  If I say "Quickly!",
perhaps it is just idiom that excludes "Didn't he come quickly!"
Or maybe it is an obscure rule of phraseology.  Do we need a
catalog of such rules, to mirror them in the pure ideal
pidgin/creole?

Maybe a change of word form in derivation is just helper wheels.
But when you can't ride, aren't helper wheels nice!"

Frankly I haven't got a clue as to why some don't use
Glosa. I've used it on some posts. One specially
addressing Charles objections to Glosa as I saw them.
Why some criticize in English, I dunno. I would
suggest that if anyone wants to criticize they
would do it in Glosa :-))) Doesn't that seem fair
enough? Heh heh... Frankly I can't stand anything
the guy writes since he tried getting me kicked off
the net by crying to my ISP.  So why even pay attention
to someone who continues to criticize and badmouth???
I dunno...

But Mike, your questions are good and they made me
think that more usage of Glosa is needed.  Keep
reminding us... I did the same in the Novial-Liste
and I still believe that constant use would flush
out trouble spots and converge usage to the point
where it works well enough.

Since,
Jay B.

If you have an inflection for number, you must specify number
in each and every noun, or be irregular. But many languages
do not require this. Same for tense, etc.

You gain the ability to not specify, if it isn't relevant.
It is best to eliminate irrelevant mandatory distinctions.

Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 13:05:02 +0930 (CST)

Thinking of patterns of derivation, used in one IAL and
not in another, suggests the idea of redundancy, things that are
avoidable but may be helpful.  Or may be a hindrance.  Helper
wheels.

They may be a help because the beginner needs or wants extra to
make out the meaning and to create the meaning.  And the market of
an IAL is always beginners, rather than native speakers.

They may be a hindrance because there are more things that you
"have" to get right.  Redundancy means that it doesn't matter if
you get a few things wrong.  Still, if there is more stuff you
feel you "have" to get right, that is a problem.

The Glosa tense marking seems to have an advantage over inflexions
which have no redundancy.  It's not as easy to be wrong with "pa",
you put it there or you don't.  It's easier to be wrong if the
present ending is "-as" and the past ending is "-is", a single
vowel change, easy to overlook.

In practice, is this a real advantage, or a real problem?  I guess
it doesn't make much difference.

If inflexions were banished from Engish we might have something
like:  The ing move finger do write and after did write do move
on.  In some languages the adjective may optionally precede or
follow the noun.  The tense marker, adverb or whatver it is could
do the same, so we could have "moveing" as well as "ing move".

To put it another way:  The anta move finger as write and after
is write as move on.  If there is a present marker as well as a
past marker there is no advantage over inflexion.  It is necessary
to say:  The ing move finger write and after did write move on.

Hmm... bottle's empty already.

Yes, I finally grasped that.

On the subject of use of the language, may I suggest that members
of this list take a look at another mailing list,
bablo{at}view{dot}net{dot}au{dot}  It is a list for all IAL users, and the basic
rule is to post in some IAL, any one.  Use of native or natural
languages prohibited.  I haven't seen Glosa used there, but there
have been messages in quite a few other languages.  If you can
decode a message, reply in Glosa.  If the language is usable.

Subject: [glosalist] new word list, RFC
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Wed, 26 Jul 2000 10:40:04 -0700


I would like to compile a new word list, as described
in previous messages the past week or two, with the
help and advice of any interested persons. It would be
placed on a web page, in the "public domain", etc etc.

It would need to grow slowly and be regularly updated
and maintained. At first it might have just the basic
Glosa and Ido roots, but I'd like to add Latin,
Occidental, and any others that people want.
This would require a fair bit of cooperative work.

Perhaps the Glosa 6000 could be added with password access;
I wouldn't want to offend the surviving Glosa author or
violate copyrights. Maybe the project should be passworded
anyway during the early stages of development.

I think the BNC English list would serve best for the
"key" field, but in database terms there cannot be any
truly acceptable "unique key" because of polysemy etc.
Still, having the English and Latin and perhaps other
natlang equivalents should make it clear enough to humans.
This approach worked well in the Novial Lexike and the
OCC Radicarium, neither of which is (fully) online.

To reduce the scope of the project to practicality,
it should focus on the most essential 5000 or so
roots likely to be present in an effective IAL.
The best lists AFAIK were listed earlier.

I am not decided exactly how it should be done, and
would appreciate hearing comments from anyone interested,
or any offers of assistance. Please send any such
replies directly to me rather than to the email list.

*   Well, Friends,
    After spending a serious amount of time trying to disambiguate
Michael's Glosa I gave up.
    The message seems to be saying that if one reads what Michael has said,
above, they will see where he lightly touches on a beginning of knowing.
    All that is needed - for the expression of the participle (I assume) -
is already in Glosa, by its very nature.
    The plans, included, to touch the IAL, will not do so without being
made more uniform, but, having said all that, (we should) simplify by
throwing out all that is not needed.

    Michael, had you included an English-language rendition (in square
brackets) after your Glosa, we could have treated the situation as a
training exercise, as well as one of information; I would have suggested
alternative - non-English-idiomatic - ways of saying what you intended to
communicate.


     So, here is a personal note from me: there is a serious difficulty
with Glosa:-
much time can be spent in editing, and attempting to correct, Glosa that
trans-scribe national language idiom.

     Glosa IS fairly easy to write, BUT, at the start, I ask learners to
edit heavily: read OUT ALOUD what you have written, so that you hear the
Glosa - not the 'national-language' translation that comes from your inner
voice.  Ask yourself, "Do I understand, directly, the Glosa words that I am
hearing, without the need to consciously translate them into my national
language?"
     When the answer is, 'No,' then you are probably hearing your
national-language idioms transferred into Glosa, and the resulting Glosa
that you have written is not following the rules of logical syntax: recast
the sentence using simple, direct language, of the "dog bites man" variety,
and re-read the edited version to HEAR the Glosa again.  When you
understand, directly, the Glosa you are hearing, then you are writing good
Glosa.
     I would suggest attempting complex phrases and clauses after you are
confident that your simple Glosa sentences are being understood.

Saluta,
  Robin

Adding u/plu and pa/nu etc particles helps a lot, though
it can get ugly if overdone. Prepositions are still difficult,

There are fewer of those in Glosa than most other auxlangs.

1. The analytic verb phrase structure (auxiliary verb ha/es/fa
preceding main verb) fairly similar to Glosa's pattern.

2. The recognizability of the vocabulary (basically, the latinate
portion of English) which Glosa does not match up to.

    Robin, I for one think that you are dead wrong in your gloomy,
sour, anti-capitalist diatribes.  Can we stick to Glosa here?

    This is good.  It is one things to discuss various aspect of a
conIAL.  It is another, and an unproductive other, to go around trying
to tear things down.  The Auxlang list has heard quite enough of this
sort of dialog of the deaf.

    Which I think is unrealistic, simply because people with different
native habits are going to look things up in different orders.  To one
person, SVO seems "natural" and "the way people think."  But the next
person says, "No, SOV is truly natural and truly the way people think."
And so on.

    In this I think he was only partially right.  While it is true that
children do not ordinarily learn from a formal grammar text, neither do
they learn free from context, including nonverbal cues.  The
paradigmatic sentence approach is all well and good as far as it goes,
but the problem is that it does not go far enough.  The context is
missing.  Connected text more than just isolated sentences is needed in
order to show, for example, that incessant marking for things like
plurality, tense, and aspect are simply not necessary in all cases, no
matter how much monoglot anglophones have been bamboozled by English
into thinking so.  And so on.

    Again, this is based on an invalid assumption which, in my opinion,
can only lead to problems.

    However, there is the position that there need not be one, single
international auxiliary language, one-size-fits-all.

Yes, Glosa will seem very close to most
Indo-European languages in its roots.
Greek and Latin have a lot in common
with the Slavic, Germanic languages and
the languages of India... due to their common
ancestry.

Thanks for the list of words, I enjoyed
reading how they compare.

     Title:
Lexicography Considerations for Tok Pisin

     Abstract:
          This article examines a number of issues that are involved in
dictionary
          compilation, including terminology, elicitation, kinds of
meanings, lexical
          relationships, componential analysis and definitions. Definitions
may be both
          folk and technical and the methodology suggested here profits from
the
          semantic framework and theory of Wierzbicka (1985, 1986, 1987), as
well
          as from other sources. Illustrations are given in Tok Pisin as
well as in
          English. The article concludes with a number of practical
suggestions which
          are relevant in compiling dictionaries in the vernacular languages
of Papua
          New Guinea.

`See my above words touching ease of learning.  The thing we are
discussing, the "just-said", (the prefix sign of the past
participle) has been shown to be unnecessary in natural languages.
Design of (touching) artificial languages has included not only
making them regular but also making them simple by discarding
everything that is unnecessary.'

The word list didn't contain "learn", thus "easy begin to know"
for ease of learning.  Likewise "only", which I synthesized as
"without more" (sine ma).  Also, "my" was missing, thus "by
means of me" (per mi).

I meant "dealing with", "about", "concerning".  The word list
contains a set of "associatives", one of which is "touching" =
"tange".  It was the nearest I could find to "about".

Seems to show that it is hard to get by without grammar, without
some way of showing how the words stand in relation to each
other.  That a succession of words as you find them in the
dictionary doesn't work.

Admittedly, that is a spectacular rush to judgement.  It was my
first ignorant attempt to write in Glosa.

Yes, I guessed that there had to be something like that.  How many
such phrases are there in Glosa?  Would a completely-defined
grammar such as that of Esperanto or Ido avoid the need for them?
You just wrote something about
"speaking-as-you-look-it-up-in-the-dictionary", which is what I
tried to do.  Can it work?  Without also looking up patterns in a
phrase-pattern book?

Okay.  Will need to think about that.  Again, it's not quite what
I understood you to be saying in another message.

Less is more. That's a good design principle.

> The word list didn't contain "learn", thus "easy begin to know"

A full list of common English words translated,
that would make it easy for the all-important beginner.

Of course many terms would be compounds; a minimal
vocabulary cannot afford separate roots for each of:
learn, teach, instruct, study, review, know, understand,
school, professor, etc. Glosa is like Tok Pisin, and there
is a web page showing how to build words without affixes:

Prepositions are trickiest part of Ido too, I think.
Some languages prefer to use verbs, like "concerning".
But that doesn't seem to be the Greek/Glosa way: "peri".

Hogben referred to the Chinese concept of "full" and "empty" words.
Normal dictionary words, nouns/verbs/adjectives, are "full".
Particles are "empty" but they implement much of the the grammar.
How else to mark a phrase boundary? (taking preps as particles)

That's nothing, I can write worse Glosa without even trying.

I would call that "relexing" and it is a major strength of Glosa
that direct relexing can work as far as it does. With a good
"phrase list" and just a few examples you would have succeeded.

Let's see: "ko (u) boni lexi-seria lista e xxx? (plu) oligo exempla"
I made up "word-series" for "phrase", and couldn't find "just/only".
Not so bad overall, eh?

It should be possible to automate this word-lookup process.
Type in English, output decent-enough Glosa. I used to have
something like that, going from Glosa to English. Hmm.

*   Unable to comment properly on Michael's message, I would say what I can about the ~ge-~ form:-

   . yes, it is an abbreviation of ~gene~,

   . Passive Voice was not considered a necessity by Ron Clark, originally, and was excluded from Glosa,

   . it was used to create the participle form, much as "-ed" or "-en" in English,

   . ~gene~ does seem the natural VERB to the Passive Voice, even though to say ~gene ge-X~ [=to be Xed] does seem like a mouthful,

   . I am in favour of Glosa having a specific Passive form, and know that this hyphenated affix does look like an inflection, though it is more of a "flag",

   . in different situations other VERBS than ~gene~ can be used,

   . while Ron Clark did derive the affix from ~gene~, he did say that it represented an interesting coincidence, with German also using #ge-# to form its Passive form.

But wouldn't I succeed as quickly, perhaps more quickly, with the
five-page "complete grammar reference" (really three pages plus
lists of affixes) of another IAL, one that does not pretend to
have no grammar, but instead, completely defines and precisely
states the grammar?

The problem I had was with the lack of definition, the fact that I
had to guess how do signify "to learn" rather than "learning", and
"does not have to be" rather than "must not".  If the words are
invariable there needs to be a book of idioms, phrase patterns.
How big a book?  If it is less than five pages, where is it?

And five pages of phrases, one per line, would be huge compared
with five pages of grammar tables.  Really, it must be a single
page.  It should be easy to put that page in the Net.  Yet it is
not there, it seems.

So, what is the vital gleam that makes Glosa the way forward?

I understand from what you (Charles) have said that only
sufficient grammar to disambiguate the communication is disclosed.
That is the advantage over a tense inflexion.  You can say "pa"
but can skip it sometimes, and almost never need to specifically
state that the verb is in the present tense.

I can understand that that leads to snappy and efficient
communication.  A language that always has to cart endings around
may become a little tedious.

That might be an important advantage of the perfect first
language, but when we are talking about an IAL, an eternal second
language, to be forever newly-encountered by adults, used in
international communication, writing international treaties and so
on, perhaps that advantage of brevity should be traded for a clear
definition of a regular grammar.

So I hope that is not it, the key factor.  Incidentally, it seems
to be shared with Peano's Interlingua.

Something that I have noticed is that some IALs differentiate
themselves by taking some factor, good in itself, to an extreme.
E.g. Occidental seems to sacrifice all else for the dream of
at-sight readability by Europeans only.  Is the grammarlessness of
Glosa, or the creoleness of Glosa a similar enthusiasm, good in
its way, but ultimately too monochromatic?

And please someone clarify the word order (which confuses and disappoints me): ADJ
NOUN versus NOUN VERB, surely
RUNNING CAT is really *semantically* equal to CAT RUNS.  If Glosa is closer to the
"language of thought" then I personally would
hope Glosa would have adjectives *after* nouns, CAT RUNNING.  What do yous think?

If someone will mail the grammar to the list, probably it will

I doubt it, because I have trouble keeping my eyes open
scanning the list of Ido affixes, for example. It is easy
to grasp the system of it, but very difficult to use.
And remember Ido was simplified from Esperanto, relying
much less on extended agglutination. Still it's too much.
Gode's interlingua abandons that systematic affixation.

Glosa has less grammar than the others, so its system
should be more easily grasped if presented properly.
But what is "the" proper way? I think many ways should
be available, because one size cannot fit all people.
Let's have more varied Glosa grammar descriptions
on the web, and see what works best for whom.

> The problem I had was with the lack of definition, the fact that I

You're right, the presentation needs to be improved.
I think it would be a good group project, anyone could
make a web page or two, and discuss them further here.
Let's start a movement! Revolt!!! Er ... sorry.
Syd's is very good.

Maybe it's better to have more easy-to-read Glosa examples,
maybe in the form of short stories; not polished, just simple.
I found that reading the many issues of Cosmoglotta, a magazine
written in Occidental, was most effective in teaching the eyes
how to parse the language without thinking of grammar at all.

Recent neurological studies show that a large percentage of
language processing is very low-level visual pattern matching,
developed only by extensive practice. I had the experience of
a sudden easing of effort and yet with greater understanding,
after about a week or two of mere reading.

You may benefit from the formal order of systematic grammar,
but most people can't do that. They need a different method.
Why economize on web pages? Let's have hundreds more,
all different, there's no center to the fabric of the web.

We can have both. Lawyers can always remember to add all
the unnecessary particles, and repeat it 16 more times,
and then translate it anyway into 25 languages.
Actually, I think a language for *common* people is needed;
the upper classes do not need an auxlang, may not want one.
A clear grammatical description would be wonderful, though.
Much is now written about pidgin/creoles, let's tap into that.

> So I hope that is not it, the key factor.

The key factor is that people really have fun with this one.
It is liberating to dispense with (most of) annoying grammar.
And yet it does work as a full language, with little effort.
(But I don't recant that serious updates to Glosa are needed.)

> E.g. Occidental seems to sacrifice all else for the dream of
> at-sight readability by Europeans only.

It does cater to eurolang speakers. Worked great on me.
OCC is extensible though, not ossified/frozen. I like
regional IALs, one for Europe, another for east Asia.
Swahili and Malay are kinda like that. IALs are no dream,
they are common throughout all of history.

Perhaps the problem is too many would-be language-tinkerers,
such as one finds on AUXLANG, who think their grammar tweaks
will save a grateful world or something. There is no need to
invent water when we are swimming in it. (But is it fresh?)
Let's be lazy, take what exists, simplify it a bit, be happy.

Glosa may be more internationally easy-to-learn than others.
No big advantage to Europeans, easier pronunciation for most.
The ideal global language *should* be colorless, unbiased;
let people provide all the color.

    I think that Glosa's greatest weakness, so to speak, has been its
presentation.  At the risk of blowing my own horn, I would refer people
to my essay, "Thoughts on IAL Success" at
http://www.smart.net/~bartlett/thoughts.html

    I think there should be both, paradigmatic examples for those to
whom that is the better approach and some sort of more formalized
grammar exposition for those who prefer and can make use of it.

> Actually, I think a language for *common* people is needed;

    Perhaps more than one IAL on more than one level.  I did once
exchange two letters in Glosa with a man in China.  They were not
particularly deep, but casual communication is often like that.

> (But I don't recant that serious updates to Glosa are needed.)

    My opinion has been for quite some time that the main things Glosa
needs are better wordlists and better promotion.  I don't really have
a lot of problem with the structure itself.

    In the end, it is probably *not* linguistic characteristics which
make or break a conIAL.  After all, look at Esperanto. ;-)  We can
tinker and diddle to our heart's content to strive ever after the will
o' the wisp of the "perfect" IAL, and at the end of the day we may not
necessarily be much farther down the road.  Once an IAL is good enough,
other factors come into play.  Sooner or later the tinkering just has
to stop.

    Considering that present Glosa users, dotted around the world , are
already kitted out with Glosa 1000 lists and _Glosa 6000_ dictionaries,
unless we can come up with a way of sending them REPLACEMENT dictionaries,
then, further fundamental research into lexicon formation will prove to be
confusing, if not divisive.

    Can we look at a balance sheet of the benefit of further fundamental
changes in the spelling of the Glosa lexicon, versus the the cost in
frustration and loos of the user-base?
    This does not mean that we should not go ahead with the
standardisation, addition of missing words, and general trimming of surplus
synonyms .. leading to the production of a _Glosa 2500_ Learner's Dictionary.
    Such rationalisation can be incorporated fairly readily into the
G-E.ALL and E-G.ALL files; however, for people without access to the Net or
to a computer, it seems only right that such Glosa supporters should be
provided with the Upgrade (2500) dictionary.  Somehow, the  Glosa 2500
dictionary, with both G->E and E->G sections, must be printed and made
available to all Glosa-pe.  This cost will probably be bourne by me;
however, the formation of finalised lists can be done by all on Glosalist.

    Before there are radical changes, however, Wendy Ashby must be involved
in the plans: this is a matter for diplomacy; while Wendy is the the
remaining Author of Glosa, we have to consider the future of the language.
I cannot become involved in a power struggle for "control" of Glosa: it is
my hope that future changes to the language will be achieved through a
consensus of all involved.

*   The word "bad" here, means not aligned with other derivatives from the
original Latin root.  Now, this "i" could have been a mistake, or the
result of much consideration by Ron and Wendy; I feel that thhe thinking by
Ron and Wendy needs to be taken into account before specific changes to the
spelling of words is decided.
    A reason for not wanting to see the promotion of numerous spelling
changes to Glosa is the disturbance it will cause to the existing
user-base.  I recall, all too clearly, the purtubing effect on me, during
the 80's, of regular, fundametal changes to the Glosa lexicon.  My
intuitive feeling is that numerous changes to the lexicon, in the present,
will, on balance, be counter-productive.

*   For this example, the ~lv~ in the middle of the word counts as the
'second consonantal sound'.  Hence  s-i-lv-i  is fundamentally CVCV.

#   Arr, well, yes.  An answer.
    The situation as I see it is that the idea of a "participle" - of
adjectivising the VERB - is a special case, similar to the "gerund" where
the VERB is nouned.

    In Glosa, the gerund was already covered - using the unchanged
substantive word and adding the 'noun flag', ~u~.  The partciple, demanded
by the Passive Voice, however, needed some other trick; was there an
'adjectival flag', or might one have to be invented?  EG

skope   =   look at; to look at; watch
u skope ju-an   =  the watching boy
un andra, skope u ju-an   =  the man, watching the boy
u skope pa es an favori tem-uti   =   watching was his favourite pass-time
an pa hedo skope plu ju-fe, to u mari-margina   =   he enjoyed watching
       (the) girls, at the sea-side

    Then, it can be disambiguated by forcing the "continuous tense", thus
using the ~du-~ as the present participle prefix.  EG

Saluta

  [Dear folks, dear Bill, dear Robin,
    Let me say again, that I think, that the internet-dictionary-
  project of Bill Patterson and others
  (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) ...is on the right way.
  We should continue to work on it before starting another project.
    As I wrote, I translated the Core-dictionary into German
  (URL is www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggldt.htm).  During this work I
  found some points I dislike.  I wrote this together to the list below
  (Sorry, it is a bit long for a mailing list, but it was important to
  me.).
    Please do not be frightened by the things below!  It could recall
  to you, how deep Glosa is already in the beginning stadium.  Let us
  not be scared, but bring it right!
    I would be very happy, if you could read my notes, perhaps send
  some comments and then improve the dictionary.  If these things will
  be fixed, we have quite a good dictionary, I think.
    Sorry for my not perfect English.
  Greetings]

  2. Notes to Single Words
  3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root
  4. Problems for a German
  5. Core and Glosa 1000



1. General Note
---------------

  You can sort them as you want: bad words remain bad words.  The Glosa
  vocabulary is inconsistent and unsystematical.  All its problems are
  mentioned and discussed in glosalist already.

  Main problems are the
  - arbitrary, random ending vowels (difficult to learn) and
  - having two source languages (Latin and ancient Greek).

  New words should be created.  Marked (e. g. with an asterisk) as not
  original Clark/Ashby/GEO-words, they should replace the 'bad' words.
  Of course, this must be done very carefully.  Wendy Ashby must be
  involved and asked about the consideration work behind these words.



2. Notes to Single Words
------------------------

A list, only catchwords. Alphabetical order.

2.1.  "anti-co" has in Literary-dictionary the meanings "but; however;
        nevertheless; though".  Please give back the Glosa-1000 "sed"
 for "but"!
2.2.  "demi" (half) is French. Latin "semi" (or Greek "hemi") would be
        better.  (Remember "U Lupus"-translation-discussion.)
2.3.  "diptera" (fly) is the animal (the fly), to fly  is "peti" or
        "vola".  "vola" is to be found under "flight". Perhaps write
        "fly {the}" and "fly {to}".
2.4.  "deskende" (descend) not necessary, instead simply: "skende
        kata".
2.5.  "eroti" (physical): error: must be "physical love".
2.6.  "es" (to be) is missing. "onto" instead. Please take Glosa1000's
        "es" again!
2.7.  "kapita": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives German "Haupt"
        (head, main..).  "Core" gives "cape". That could mean a "high
        point of land going out into the sea" or a "sleeveless garment,
        hanging from the shoulders".  The file "Glosa Basic Reference"
        gives "kapota - bonnet", that would be a synonym to the second.
        "kapota" is not in Literary-dictionary.
2.8.  "ko{n}" wrongly sorted in. Must be treated like "kon" and/or like
        "ko".
2.9.  "kordiali - warm". Not the temperature is meant but an emotion
        (Remember our "U Lupus"-translation-discussion. Cf. Latin "cor,
        cordis" - heart).  It would be better to take "meso-termo -
        warm" and for "kordiali" only "hearty".
2.10. "krati-grega": The book "Deutsch-Glosa1000" gives for "Regierung"
        (government) "krati".  So "krati" is enough, "krati-grega" is
        not necessary.
2.11. "krispa": Core gives "contract". Note: not the "treaty" is meant,
        but to "make shorter; to curl".
2.12. "kritiki-ra":  The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" says "kritici" is
        enough for German "Kritik", so "kritiki" would be enough for
 "criticism".
2.13. "mali-dice": "curse" (German "fluchen") is not always "swear"
        (German "schwören").  "I swear I love you." is not "mali".
2.14. Regular comparison is necessary for an auxiliary language. So:
        peiora - worse (schlechter) ==> ma mali
        pesimi - worst (schlechtester, am schlechtesten) ==> maxi mali
        optimi - best (bester, am besten) ==> maxi boni
2.15. "satura" - rich: Latin "satur, satura saturum" is satisfied,
        copious; better for "rich"/wealthy would be "pluto".
2.16. "porta" (harbor) should be "portu", because "porta" is also
        "door" and "to carry".
        (cf. Latin: portus, portus m. - harbur, u-declination, so root
               would be portu;
                    porta, portae f.  - door, a-declination, so root
        would be porta;
             portare           - carry, a-conjugation, so root
        would be porta (too))
2.17. "positi": The book "Deutsch-Glosa 1000" gives German "Posten,
        Stand" (post, place).  For "to put" would be better "loka".
 "loka" is already in Core with "to lay" (see 3.xx).
2.18. "repei" (reply): perhaps typing error, should be "repli".
2.19. "vid-abili": Simpler and better would be "vide-abili".  If we
        take "vid-abili", we should take also "aud-abili" instead of
 "audi-abili" and  "honor-abili" instead "honora-abili".
2.20. For English "first" Glosa has not only "prima" and "proto", but
        also "mo" (in after-position!).  "mo {afterposition}" should be
 supplement to Literary-dictionary, and be prefered for
 Core-dictionary.
2.21. Some words may not so necessary for a beginner's dictionary:
        palpebra (eyelid) (see also 3.60)
 operkula (lid) (see also 3.60)
        runi (rune)
      Other examples could be found, discussed and eliminated.  This
      will be shown by practical use of the dictionary.



3. Synonyms in Core and Examples of Concepts with More Than One Root
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The intention of the internet dictionary project was to get a
beginner's dictionary without synonyms (words with same meaning).

Nevertheless the list below shows synonyms of Core.  This results from
English synonyms and computer sorting.  Some of the synonyms are
"real", (you know the thesis "A language has NO synonyms."), others are
at least so near together, that one of each pair should be removed from
Core and move to a higher level dictionary ("Base" or "Literary").  A
discussion how to treat each word will be necessary.

More tricky is the problem of words with related meanings.  They have
to go back to the same root, but a lot in Core do not.  It could not
be, that we eliminate part-of-speech-markers in Glosa, and then related
words, differing only in part-of-speech, have different roots, only to
distinguish them.  Then an old-fashioned part-of-speech-marker-system
would be better.
(e. g. iloto (dirty) - adjective / tolo (dirt) - noun).

Reading the list below, please keep in mind:
- Sources for Glosa words's meanings are the Richmond lists (and there are
  several different lists, so perhaps you have a list with other meanings)
  and the meanings of the classical origins.
- The author (me) is not a native English speaker.

Now the list:

4. Problems for a German
------------------------

4.1 It is not easy to distinguish between:
      hekasto (each, every) / panto (all) / holo (hole) /
        (G1000:) singu.
4.2 The German does not distinguish:
      ali (any) / uno (some)
    ... and an international auxiliary language MUST NOT do either!!!



5. Core and Glosa 1000
----------------------

The discussion in glosalist showed, that here there are two opinions:

The Glosa traditionalists (maybe Robin Gaskell, Nick Hempshall, Marcel
Springer) think, Glosa-1000-words should be prefered. Otherwise the
language would be damaged, the small group of Glosa-users would be
splitted.  A text written with Core-dictionary could not be understood
by a Glosa-1000-learner.

Others (maybe Bill Patterson, Charles) say, Glosa 1000 does not really
exist, because the several 1000-lists contradict each other. They
think, to give Glosa the chance of becoming THE world language, the
best synonym each must be chosen.  These best synonyms are not found
by the taste of two language designers, but by systematical research,
perhaps by comparison of several Romanic languages (Latin, Spain,
Italian, French), other modern languages with many speakers (English,
Russian, German) or other auxiliary language's design drafts (Ido,
Novial, Occidental, Interlingua de IALA) or perhaps by a word
derivation scheme (e. g. Peano's Interlingua/Latina sine Flexione).

Perhaps a compromise between these two groups could be found.

Below there is a list of words of Core-dictionary not in Glosa 1000.

What can we do with it?
- The book "Central Glosa" contains the interesting word list
  "English 5000 to Glosa 1000". It gives more than one meaning to one
  Glosa word (should be 5000/1000=1). With this list some more of the
  Core-words below could be expressed with Glosa 1000 words.
- Some of the words below differ to 1000-words only in the ending
  vowel.  The ending-vowel is a problem on its own (---> start a new
  project).
- Some of the words below may be in one Glosa-1000-list, but not in
  mine.  The contradiction of GEO-word-lists is a problem on its own,
  too.

Now the list: it shows Glosa-word,  Englisch meaning, (German meaning)
(==> Glosa-1000-Wort)]:

5.1.   absenti  absent (abwesend) ==> G1000: ab; ne ci; ne la
5.2.   abstrakti  abstract (abstrakt, Auszug, abstrahieren)
5.3.   acikula  prickly (stachelig)
5.4.   adagio  slow (langsam) ==> G1000: no-tako; lento
5.5.   adeo  goodbye (Leb wohl!)  ==> G1000: vale
5.6.   adhesi  adhere, adhesive (kleben, klebrig)
5.7.   adhesi-ma  paste (Kleister) ==> G1000: pasta
5.8.   adinami  weak (weich) ==> G1000: no-resista; debili
5.9.   adjace  local (örtlich) ==> G1000: lokali
5.10.  adjusta  adjustment (Einstellung, Anordnung)
5.11.  ...
...

  (Stop, stop, stop.  You will kill me, if I would post the whole
  list here.)
...

5.895.  vultu  expression (Ausdruck) ==> G1000: dice klari; emotio
5.896.  zeloso  jealous, jealousy (eifersüchtig, neidisch, Eifersucht,
          Neid)
5.897.  zemia  loss (Verlust)
5.898.  zeo  boil (kochen, sieden)
5.899.  zeugo  team (Team, Gruppe, Arbeitsgruppe, Mannschaft)
          ==> G1000: grega

But the final vowels hardly ever matter, and so don't really
need to be spelled "right". They'll all sound like schwa anyway.
Still, they should be etymologically plausible if possible.
There might even be a desirable cross-correlation with the
main vowel, e.g. C-a-CC-e vs. C-o-CC-i (I just made this up),
to make spelling super-easy. Hey, I should patent this "technology"!

I agree that many of the C-V-CC-V patterns can be pronounced easily
by nearly everyone globally, therefore are acceptable. Actually,
having 3 consonants is better mnemonically and even esthetically.
The final vowel is not significant, so there are under 2000 good
CVCV roots available, but many times more CVCCV's; and it's better
not to use all of them, for easier recognition.

The endings are insignificant and can be ignored in 99% of cases.

Latin is better, but Greek can't be removed, and often
they conflict. I don't know any solution except toleration.

Add words where necessary, but we must keep all the old too,
as "archaisms". Zamenhoff called it "the method of neologism".
Then let evolution sort it out.

I am unhappy with the whole bunch of u/un/mo/ali/singu/prima/etc words.
Should be "un = one = indefinite", but this will probably never happen.

Agreed, it is unsavory to me also. Perhaps if the whole set
of words in the determiners/quantifiers group were analyzed,
there could be found enough good words to use, and then leave
the others out of the new "basic" set.

Sure, let's just find the 2500 *best* words and call them
the "net basic 2500" set; maybe add some that are missing.
There is no way any 1000 word vocab can handle even the most
basic use by beginners. (But 6000 is too many to learn.)
Esperanto started with around 750 but quickly grew.
The "bad" words can be ignored, and eventually forgotten.

    Somehow, the Glosa 2500 dictionary must be made available in many
more languages in addition to English.

    Strange.  Many languages with a somewhat isolating morphology form
passive constructions with some form of a verb like 'to be'.  What is
wrong with 'es ge-X'?  It seems to me that the 'gene ge-X' is modelled
on British dialects of English.  My experience has been that Americans
and users of British dialect use "get" rather differently, so that the
'gene ge-X' construction is merely an importation from British English.

    Auxiliary language design involves a lot of trade-offs.  Slavish
adherence to some single principle at all costs, come what may, may
result in an inferior product.  For example, one Esperantist criticism
of Ido's plural construction in '-i' is that it creates an inflection
instead of an agglutination, and some Esperantists insist that only
agglutination should be allowed, come hell or high water.  I am not
attempting to mediate that dispute, but only to point out that some
designers have been willing to bend some one principle on other
grounds.  To say that Glosa must *ABSOLUTELY* eschew anything which
even seems to smack of a dreaded inflection seems to me to be merely
foolish.  Something may be beautiful as a paper theory, but in the real
world something else may actually be more practical.

    Although there are a small handful of word pairs differing only by
the terminal vowel.

    Possibly only from the mouths of us native English speakers, who
tend to blur and reduce our vowels.  Other users from different native
tongues may be much more precise in their vowel articulations.  I
suggest that native-speech sloppiness should not be an excuse for poor
articulation of an auxiliary language.

I disagree! Final vowels are very important. They help us to
understand words clearly. Just because English and French do
something of the sort does not at all mean that it is desirable.
Actually the lack of clear final vowel confuses the sound. To
a native speaker of Spanish, Portuguese, Italian etc. the lack
of distintc vowel sounds in English means that everything sounds
like it's mumbled. Vowels help to make communication easier.
Since,

And "somewhat isolating" includes IALs with more "grammar" (yes, I
mean grammatical machinery such as inflexions and agglutinated
glue).  Several of them are more isolating than English, but don't
try for the extreme of Glosa.

Or 'es X-ge', 'es X-ata'?

Interesting, that english version of number 2 suggests to me that
she is in the habit of running, which glosa would indicate explicitly
by ~more~. Also ~eqa~ seems to me to be to "formal", why not
use the more relaxed ~es~. I don't see any problem with the
construction in number 4.

For me, the various Glosa 1000 lists are the heart of Glosa, and should not
be
radically altered. Only where mistakes or contradictions are found, should
changes
be made. Leave the rest to evolution by actual usage.

I don't feel the same about Glosa 6000, which I think is just a registration
of the Greek
and Latin elements in terms already in use by science. This makes them
legitimately part
of Mega Glosa, like any other "international" word (such as those in the
Interlingua
IED), if presented in Glosa form. Such words are available, if the speaker
or writer
feels the need to use them.

I don't think we are free to trawl the Greek and Latin dictionaries for
words, but
should only use the elements of words that are in "international" use. Of
course, it
is true that people don't know what these elements mean. They are just
familiar
patterns of sounds. Learning Glosa gives them meaning. This explains the
sci-tech
words that we have up to now taken as wholes, and so makes Glosa memorable.

I would go with ~silva~ too.

But this raises the question about whether the final vowel should be
"regulated".
Aren't they a matter of personal choice at the moment?

Note english sci-tech words: silvicolous and silviculture or sylviculture
compared with silva and sylvan.

*

I suggest that to make Glosa clearer and easier to understand, that
A standard Glosa sentence could be looked upon as having 4 phrases:- verb
phrase, and to start with in some sentences, 2 preposition phrases and a noun
phrase, for instance, VP=pa dona, NP=u avi, PP1=a gina and PP2= per andro.
The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the
indirect object PP1 and VP could be at the end. In fact any order would work.
If we all agreed to standardize we could trim the "per" off and have
subjectNP   VP  object  NP and then PP1. I would personally prefer the
symmetry of NP VP NP to either VP NP NP or NP NP VP and I think that
separating the 2 NPs would make the sentence more easily understood. Adding
PP1 at the end would not disturb the symmetry very much. To give variety or
emphasis the order could be varied to NP(old object)u avi VP+"ge"(to signal
the reversal of the positions of object and subject). We now have
possibilities to complete the sentence:- full stop or PP1 or PP2 or both PP1
and PP2 in either order (the English passive can be very useful). The "ge" is
derived from the word "gene" and, as far as I can see could be said to have
little to do with the "ge-" of German.
In Glosa, a phrase seems to have 3 parts, an introductory small word (IW) at
the beginning, the head word (HW) at the end and various bits of adjectival
or adverbial gubbins in the middle(MG).
U + alti + andro. HW is usually followed by IW of the next phrase. Where this
is so, it is easy to distinguish the phrases and IW identifies the phrase's
function. NP, PP,VP etc. The IP of NP could be "u", "plu", "multi" or a
numeral, of VP, "pa", "fu", "du" etc. I personally would like an IP for the
present tense i.e. "pres" or "pi" for present indicative. The IP of a PP
would be a preposition and, as this will be followed by a NP, the word "u"
could be amalgamated into the prep and be omitted .
Adjectival gubbins would need to be in the apropriate NP or it would be
difficult which NP was being gubbinized . On the other hand, as there is only
1 VP an adverbial gubbins could be more or less anywhere and being placed
away from the VP would shorten and simplify the actual sentence.

The order NP  VP  NP PP seems to be the norm as Glosa was initially developed
in England but other orders could be acceptable if it were clear what was to
follow.
(u orto glosa-V--)
u alti andro pa gentili dona plu pusi avi a kali gina.
(glosa neo u---V)
avi pusi plu gina kali a andro alti u dona gentili.        Present tense
implied
(glosa u neo V----)
dona gentili pri gina a kali andro per alti avi plu pusi    pri=present tense
(u orta glosa)

*   There is a sadness about this, for me.  I still use the Glosa 6000 book
as my ready reference.  If the consensus is for major revisions of the
dictionary, will we be able to get Wendy Ashby to to do a new edition
through her previous printer?

*   So, I would suggest that a revision, a possible Glosa Ver_3, might come
out first as the 2500-word Learner's Dictionary.  It might have to be
prined in Australia, as I know that Wendy has no spare money for the
production of a new dictionary; so I had better start showing _Glosa 6000_
to printers to get some quotations on the likely cost of a comparable book.
 Needless to say, my finances are not a lot better than Wendy's.

    And until scientific evidence comes up to support either position, I
guess we can agree to disagree.

    This does not mean that I do not understand that Glosa - as a language
for human speech - cannot be improved upon; however, if there is to be any
transition to a Glosa_3, I would like to think that it can occur with the
minimum of damage to the players .. avoiding the typical 'sharp turn on
heel, and walk out' scenario, seen all too often in the Interlanguage saga.

    And there is the remaining question of whether you can put up with the
<italic>textural textual</italic> emphasis, or whether I, and other
late-model users, must put up with not using the bold/italic/underlined
word-processing options?

    Should there be a convention on Glosalist house style?  What does the
panel think?

Saluta,
  Robin

    In general I tend to agree.  Howeer, as I mentioned previously,
when I collated the various "1000" lists into the Glosa Basic
Reference, I came up with more than 1000 wordss.  I am of the opinion
that for basic communication -- not necessarily for writing law codes
or international treaties! -- the vocabulary should be kept within
bounds.  That's why I have not been a supporter of Glosa 6000 as if it
should be the standard.  With a judiciously chosen vocabulary FROM
ALREADY EXISTING MATERIALS (I think I may have originally come up with
the ~2500 figure), it should be possible with good typography to
produce a booklet containing two-way wordlists, examples, and perhaps
a few explanatory notes.

Here is a better quasi-scientific notation which
captures the essential syntax you are trying to
describe informally, now using a rough BN form:

sentence:    (prepphrases) subject predicate
subject:     nounphrase
prepphrases: preposition nounphrase
nounphrase:  (determiner) (adjectives) noun (prepphrases)
predicate:   verbphrase (nounphrase) (prepphrases)
verbphrase:  (auxiliaries) verb

auxiliaries:  pa, nu, du, es, etc.
determiner:   u, plu, u-la, etc.
prepositions: de, ad, peri, etc.

> The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the
> indirect object PP1 and VP could be at the end. In fact any order would work.

This is not true; Glosa is very dependent on phrase order
within clauses and words within phrases. I would prefer
to force the object to always immediately follow the verb,
and the subject to always immediately precede, though
it may have its own "heavy modifiers" intervening.
In Glosa as in English, light modifiers (the articles,
quantifiers, adjectives) go to the left of the noun,
and heavies go to the right.

Prepositional phrases (and subclauses, treated the same)
must always modify their immediate predecessor. Otherwise
you get "attachment ambiguities" as in English which are
unacceptable in a well-defined syntax. A sentence-initial
prepphrase is "adverbial", modifying the whole sentence,
and a verb-following prepphrase is an "oblique object",
i.e. not a direct object but closely related to the verb.
Lone adverbs can also act as prepositional phrases.
The above scheme could be modified to show that:

sentence: (sentencemodifier) subject predicate
sentencemodifier: prepphrases
sentencemodifier: adverb
predicate: verbphrase (object) (obliques)
object: nounphrase (prepphrases)
obliques: prepphrases

This sort of thing is excellently described in Rick
Morneau's essay on syntax: http://srv.net/~ram/syntax.html

A subject is not always the doer of the verb's action.
It is always the highlighted "star" of the sentence.
Passive voice was invented to enable swapping like this:

"dog bit man"       ... talking mainly about the dog, and subject=doer
"man is bit by dog" ... the man is more important, but object=doer
"man is bitten"     ... there is no doer (agent)
"dog bit            ... there is no doee (patient)

In English it can get confusing and amusing:
"the dog bit the man in the closet/butt."

Other languages would use other patterns, but Glosa is
really a simplified and hopefuly regularized English
syntax with relexed Greco-Latin vocabulary. There can be
but little latitude in the word order without catastrophe.
Ido and Occidental use part-of-speech marking to safely
allow such variation, but that is not the Glosa way.

I think this is the consensus, and most wise.

This is an interesting concept. Is it official? It might
lead to chaos. Not saying I oppose it, just wondering.

What a refreshing and brilliant idea; I will steal it.
Whatever final vowel comes to mind while speaking or writing
*is* correct. Life is too short for memorization of trivia.

It's not a good idea to send actual pictures

Anyway, it was not visible in Netscape.

Thinking about core vocabulary some more ... I found this
by searching the Linguist List for "topic dictionary":

http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9512D&L=linguist&P=R4044

Roget's Thesaurus and many other resources were discussed.
Roget's was used by Ron Clark to devise the Glosa vocab,
but the details or methodology are unknown to me.
One of the other items was Steven Glazier's "word menu",
which I bought and find very useful.

I would like to have Glosa vocab categorized in a similar
manner. Any systematic method is good, among other reasons
because it can expose holes or redundancies in the vocabulary.
In an online database (I mean just a simple multicolumn list)
multiple categorizations can be accomodated simultaneously.
For instance, a horse might be "animal; vehicle; food" ...

Syd, please dont send such big files to the

me no purpose to receive the picture. Please
be careful when sending large files. There
are others on the list who I'm sure will have
problems receiving such large files, some

A little picture of 10k is just as good
for a test as a picture of 2 Mb.

    According to my anti-spam flter log, today my filters automatically
discarded a message from Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com that was 2263332 bytes long.
I don't know what this was, and I don't really care.  It is extremely
bad internet manners to send such a message to a mailing list
unsolicited.  I hope it will never be done again (although my filters
will just throw it away again).  Some people have limits on the email
they can receive.  Either they cannot receive such monsters at all, or
they may wind up paying additional actual money because of someone
else's thoughtlessness.  The proper way is to make an announcement and
either send it only to those who request or place it on a site from
which it can be fetched.

Yes, I think this sounds like a most excellent way forword.

Also Marcel Springer's sugestion about the "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" word

Warning not to download ones mail is impossible
unless you are going to telephone each one of
us. And then what would we do? The problem is
the sending of picture files or any file that
is quite lengthy... more than 100k. They take
longer to download and there is no way for some
of us to bypass downloading it and read other
mail.

The best solution is never to send such files.
Instead put them on the Web and give an address
where people can visit and see the file if they
wish.

Please keep this in mind... I myself have made
similar mistakes, I'm sure some of us have done
this sort of thing, but we just have to learn
and keep on going.

w/regards,
Jay B.

Subject: [glosalist] a more flexible phrase order
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Sun, 30 Jul 2000 15:13:52 -0700


The recent suggestion to allow noun phrases to float more
freely than permitted by Glosa's strict SVO order, is much too
tempting for this recovering conlanger to resist any longer.
Although it would stretch or break the creoleness of Glosa,
it might happen, if Glosa were to evolve/drift/degenerate
into a natlang in some alternate universe.

First the preposition "per" (or some other, maybe "ex")
would become obligatory in Glosa-2 for marking agent/doer,
as is already allowed marginally in the Glosa of now:

G1:   kani pa morda u andro         ... the usual "active voice"
G1:   andro es ge-morda per kani    ... the less common "passive"

G2e:  per kani pa morda u andro     ... "ergative" becomes mandatory
G2e:  andro pa morda per kani       ... new improved passive, no "es ge-"
G2e:  per kani u andro pa morda     ... SOV etc orders now possible

Meanwhile, a different ("nominative") dialect of Neo-Glosa
marks the object/patient with "em", instead of the agent:

G2n:  pa morda u kani em andro      ... VSO version

Being human, they make war for this or something equally important.
A subtle mixing, as in England the Danes mixed with Anglo-Saxons,
now results. Order is free at last and there is peace for a time:

G3:   in horti per kani em andro pa morda
G3:   pa morda em andro per kani in horti

This demonstrates how the price of free constituent order
is a greatly increased difficulty in parsing (mentally)
even the simplest sentences, exactly as in Esperanto-1.
Cute, though.

No need for major changes, and no need to revise the G-6000.
Only a change in "policy": a word still ought to be spelled
as defined in official references, *but* the final vowels are
merely cosmetic, so variant spellings of finals are "acceptable"
and will not be used to differentiate any new word pairs.
Never tell learners they're "wrong" because of a silly final;
especially since the authors weren't consistent themselves!

The new Net-2500 should carefully select from among the "best" words,
avoiding pairs e.g. bali/bale. Any confusion would dwindle with time;
my guess is that 99% of Glosa users will never even see the G-6000.
So-called "backward compatibility" is a good thing sometimes ...
as long as it doesn't stop progress.

Specialty printing using personal computers is now a lot easier
and higher-quality than it was; I think a good Net-2500 list
can attract a huge new audience, and only a small percentage
of those need to order the nicer (new and old) printed materials
to make it viable.

this might interest Charles. It's about a reasonably standard word order
otherwise Glosa can be difficult to decypher but allows for flexibility of
phrase order. There should be a couple of diagrams but I dropped a clanger
over them and made myself unpopular. Incidentally is there a way of removing
grotty emails from the list? I'm still sruggling to get a web page done - In
AOL is the remote filename the name of a file on my computer or of one on the

sorry about the lapse into English.......

I suggest that to make Glosa clearer and easier to understand, that
A standard Glosa sentence could be looked upon as having 4 phrases:- verb
phrase, and to start with in some sentences, 2 preposition phrases and a noun
phrase, for instance, VP=pa dona, NP=u avi, PP1=a gina and PP2= per andro.
The order would not matter as the subject would be PP2, the object NP, the
indirect object PP1 and VP could be at the end. In fact any order would work.
If we all agreed to standardize we could trim the "per" off and have
subjectNP   VP  object  NP and then PP1. I would personally prefer the
symmetry of NP VP NP to either VP NP NP or NP NP VP and I think that
separating the 2 NPs would make the sentence more easily understood. Adding
PP1 at the end would not disturb the symmetry very much. To give variety or
emphasis the order could be varied to NP(old object)u avi VP+"ge"(to signal
the reversal of the positions of object and subject). We now have
possibilities to complete the sentence:- full stop or PP1 or PP2 or both PP1
and PP2 in either order (the English passive can be very useful). The "ge" is
derived from the word "gene" and, as far as I can see could be said to have
little to do with the "ge-" of German.
In Glosa, a phrase seems to have 3 parts, an introductory small word (IW) at
the beginning, the head word (HW) at the end and various bits of adjectival
or adverbial gubbins in the middle(MG).
U + alti + andro. HW is usually followed by IW of the next phrase. Where this
is so, it is easy to distinguish the phrases and IW identifies the phrase's
function. NP, PP,VP etc. The IP of NP could be "u", "plu", "multi" or a
numeral, of VP, "pa", "fu", "du" etc. I personally would like an IP for the
present tense i.e. "pres" or "pi" for present indicative. The IP of a PP
would be a preposition and, as this will be followed by a NP, the word "u"
could be amalgamated into the prep and be omitted .
Adjectival gubbins would need to be in the apropriate NP or it would be
difficult which NP was being gubbinized . On the other hand, as there is only
1 VP an adverbial gubbins could be more or less anywhere and being placed
away from the VP would shorten and simplify the actual sentence.

The order NP  VP  NP PP seems to be the norm as Glosa was initially developed
in England but other orders could be acceptable if it were clear what was to
follow.
(u orto glosa-V--)
u alti andro pa gentili dona plu pusi avi a kali gina.
(glosa neo u---V)
avi pusi plu gina kali a andro alti u dona gentili.        Present tense
implied
(glosa u neo V----)
dona gentili pri gina a kali andro per alti avi plu pusi    pri=present tense
(u orta glosa)
u alto andro du gentila dona plu pusi avi a kala gina. I like this one -
rhyming phrasesâ¦â¦.

The Europeano site mentioned above is mine.
I never would have described Interlingua de 
Peano as a forerunner of Glosa, but I guess in
some ways that may be accurate. Of course 
Interglossa is the actual forerunner of Glosa,
and the ideas that went into putting together
Interglossa were developed out of an appreciation
for the simplicity found in Interlingua and the
thought that the internationality of Greek roots
was a common feature of the scientific vocabulary
in actual use in many modern languages. 

I say the site is mine since I'm the one who for
the most part put it together. John has moved to
Ohio and sends me a message once in a while,
Jon and Umberto have gone over to the new
Interlingua (of IALA, as I have, but I see IALA's
work a direct descendant of Peano's language,
as well as Liptay, and Lott's). The site is in need
of an update; there sure are a lot of people that 
visit it and send email to europeano{at}geocities{dot}com
which get sent to John and he bounces them back
to me. However, the thought that Interlingua de
Peano was a forerunner of Glosa has never been
a topic of any inquiries into that site's email.

Hmm? But an interesting idea nonetheless...

Since,
Jay B.

Sticking to plain ascii, no frills, better for communications
sake... if you need to highlight use CAPS with care, and
"quotes" or _underscore_ for emphasis... seems quite a
good solution to me.

With so many synonyms having a Greek and a Latin
root it would be an interesting project to separate these
into two wordlists. One having Greek roots. The other
having Latin roots. Then comparing texts in each of the
two alternatives and getting feedback on the two.

What say ye?

*   Seems a lovely idea: reminds me of the time Haitao was wrting to me in
Esperanto (at his own request), and I had to translate the Espo into
English before I - using Glosa - could respond to his posts.
    If there wasn't a full-scale Revolution going on - out there - in the
real world, I could possibly enjoy _babbling_ with the bablos; such
pleasure is, I fear, denied me by the fact that very soon there might not
be an outside world - as we know it - to allow me the esoteric luxury of
being totally confused by the cacophany of auxiliary voices.

I'll have to give it a miss until after 2012,

*   So, if a language has a minor degree of redundancy, this could be a
good thing for learners.  I agree.  Glosa was designed to have virtually no
redundancy, but a little snuck in.  This made it more 'human' and less rigid.

*   As a one-time teacher, I can confirm this difference: tell the kids
that the words differ simply by an "X" and a "Y" then you are asking for
trouble; you are triggering them for error.  Glosa's no inflection policy
does make the modifying particles much easier to recognise and remember.
    What's more, PA, DU, FU and NU all feature a distinctively different
consonant.  I have always thought of it as a ''Meccano'' language, and have
found it as easy to construct, because the bits look and sound so different.

>In practice, is this a real advantage, or a real problem?  I guess

*   Wrong guess!
    When the neophyte speaks an analytical languasge, he can always pause
.. to gather his thoughts .. between words; but, when using the
agglutinative, synthetic-type language, he feels like an idiot pausing
once, or twice, during the delivery of one, highly inflected word!

>If inflexions were banished from Engish we might have something

*   Now we're getting silly.
    English will never be reformed, or have usages banished.
    Using English 'inflections' as "words" is senseless, because they
developed into their present form over a long period, and do not make sense 
in this "analytic" form.  What's more the syntax analysis used in
Functional Grammar makes more sense than your attempt, here.

>        The tense marker, adverb or whatver it is could
>do the same, so we could have "moveing" as well as "ing move".
>
*   My researches come to the conclusion that although there seems an
endless variation in the way we can use English, this is not so, and each
of the possible alternatives has its own feel for 'the proper syntax.'
    The better, published writers all tend to use the same set of syntax
rules.
    Glosa has a reasonably well defined set of syntax rules, too; however,
it has been designed to offer less variation in the turn of phrase.

>To put it another way:  The anta move finger as write and after
>is write as move on.  If there is a present marker as well as a
>past marker there is no advantage over inflexion.  It is necessary

>
*   As "He runs," can be little else than a present statement, ~An kurso,~
is also a clear-cut present tense statement.  It is just the bare
Infinitive form.
    As, again, in English, we can stress the actual moment of the present,
so too, in Glosa, we can extend, or modify, the meaning of the present:-
 EG   He is running now.   -->  An du nu kurso.
                            continues now to run
No sweat. No inflection. Simple pre-particles lead us into the VERB. 
    This idea, of having the substantive word at the end of the phrase, is
called Head Final structure; and, in Glosa, it applies to both Noun Phrases
and Verb Phrases.  With a reasonably well-defined heirarchy of function
words leading up to the final substantive word, this gives Glosa a clearly
distinctive, and readily recognisable, phrasal structure.   
    For the reason of demarking phrase and clause boundaries, punctuation,
in Glosa, has grammatical signiificance.  And I hasten to add, that in
non-seen, spoken utterance, the very same boundaries are denoted by vocal
inflection. 
    I send this posting in an attempt to say that the transcription of
idiomatic English does NOT make Glosa.

    On turning the coin over, we do find that good Glosa does, for the most
part, transcribe into grammatically correct English; and, without pushing
the comparison too far, well-written, literal English usually does 
transcribe into good Glosa. 

    Over recent years my English writing style has been improving.
Although this could be a simple case of ^try, try again,^ I tend to relate
the recent thinking I apply to the turning of my English-language phrases, 
to the mental effort that I have been putting into improving my Glosa.
    So, Glosa could be good for you.

Saluta,
  Robin
    P.S.  The idea of Head Final structure is spelt out with Glosa examples
in the attachd Seminar #1.   R.

Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="Seminar.#1"

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

    However, there are patterns in common in English and the other more
successful national languages: we are still struggling with the idea of a
"Universal Grammar."

    The Intelingua people back-slid.

*   Though I have not understood you perfectly, I would say that both
inflected and non-inflected languages incorporate the same functions, but,
physically, achieve them differently.
    And although I have not studied it, I do understand that Signed
Language is also "inflected", and this is developed, naturally, by young
people using the standard Signs.  So, a tendency towards inflection 'could'
be a part of the universal language story.
    In terms of the tense inflections of VERBS, Glosa achieves this quite
well with particles.  Some other aspects are achieved with separate words,
such as the conditionality of ~sio~.

*   As I explained in an earlier post, the Passiive Voice arrived late in
Glosa's development, and the authors decided the neatest way of adding it
was by invoking a participle.  Thus GENE -> GE- was born.
    And, yes, purists label this as an "inflection."  Work it out for
yourself: if the "-en" of "woken" and the "-ed" of "chased" in ..
"I was woken and chased by a wild bull," are ''inflections'' then so is the
~ge-~ of ~ge-leve~ in ~An gene ge-leve per u fo soni explode.~
    So, why, you might ask, is it hyphenated?  Because, in Glosa,
pronunciation is with the penultimate vowel (or the final vowel, if there
is only one), thus ~geleve~ and ~ge-leve~ sound different; and, for
practical purposes, might be quite different words!

>Entire avoidance of morphological change in derivation is more

*   This is a true problem: in some cases we have such derivations built
in, as in ~kapitala~ [capital] and ~kapitalismo~ [capitalism] plus
~sociali~ and ~socialismo~; but if you were to derive a new word, I would
ask you to hyphenate. 
 EG   sustine   -   sustain
      sustin-abili   -   sustainable
      sustin-abili-ra   -   sustainability
  <Yes, I did look it up in the Latin dictionary.  It was not as
fashionable a decade ago, when the Glosa 6000 was put together, as it is 
now.  It IS our responsibility to keep the Glosa lexicon current.>

   Linguistically the hyphens are necessary both as a guide to
pronunciation and derivation; and they seem part of the language.  Were I
to write ~sustinabilira~ the word would look undecipherable, and the stress
of pronunciation would be on the penultimate "I" which is NOT stressed in
the pronunciation of the correctly derived, compound word.

*   If we need rules they are the simple pragmatic rules of combining
pronunciation with the excision of unwanted terminal vowels, combined with
hyphenation.  However, Glosa will be used in context, as is English, so the
sorts of problems, above, will be substantially the same for Glosa as they
are for English.

*   As I see it the hyphens are the ^trainer wheels.^
    However, there are two basic forms of Glosa, the highly elided, and the
completely unelided: beginners would learn the language better, by, at the
start, throwing everything in,  EG
   An age vagona.   ...  He drove.    He drives.    He drives the car.
   [he drive (the car)]

   Un andra pa age u vagona.   ...   The man drove the car.
  [the man did drive the car]

That's probably not fair (or too fair) to Ron Clark.  Wasn't the
inclusion of Greek roots a key part of the vision of Bodmer/
Hogben?

One of their arguments, I think, was that it would assist the
inclusion of scientific words in the future language.

Some other IALs have chosen roots from the languages most largely
spoken in Europe this (20th) century.  What is most common among
them often turns out to have come from Latin (because of the
combined weight of English and the romance languages), so they get
about the same outcome as the Interlingua policy of taking direct
from Latin.

But also, since science coinings are generally international, and
often Greek-based, that approach of taking from modern languages
seems to achieve the objective that was hoped to come from
directly Greek-based roots.

Marcel's sample of English words beginning in RO:

roam, roar, roast, rob, robe, robot, robin,
rock, rocket, rod, rogue, roll, romance,
roof, room, root, rope, rose, rot,
rough, round, rouse, route, routine,
rove, row boat, row, royal

Kilgariff's words in RO:

road n
roar v
rob v, robbery n
rock n
rock v
rocket n
rod n
role n
roll n
roll v
romance n, romantic a
roof n
room n
root n, root v
rope n
rose n
rotation n
rotten a
rough a, roughly adv
round a, round adv, round n, round prep, round v
route n
routine n
row n
row v
royal a, royalty n

So by my rough count, the M-list includes 19 of 25 K-items.
This approximates a good practical word list for English-Glosa.

We could be sure that if the K-list were fully equivalenced,
there would be *no* *holes* in the Glosa vocabulary, because
the BNC is the largest corpus of English ever assembled,
and the K-list covers over 90% of word usage by frequency.
Yet, this requires much less than 6000 Glosa roots.
No other auxlang/IAL has accomplished this sort of
systematic validation of its vocabulary.

I already commented about word order, basically
you have to be very careful and can't change
very much without breaking it, except that you can
often move prepositional phrases around a bit,
but even there you can get ambiguity as to what
the preposition attaches to:

If "I shot the dog in the forest", what exactly
was in the forest? Several possibilities.
English is rife with attachment ambiguities.
But in Glosa I expect "in" to modify only "dog".

I do think a new direct object preposition "em" would
nicely accomplish much of what you suggest, though.
And indirect object should *never* lack a preposition.
Then you could freely move the "per/ad/em" phrases.
Then, the only safe place for adverbial phrases would
be the very front or immediately following the verb.
And it's already mostly like that, so why not?

Then I have some good news for you! Standard Glosa uses ~nu~ to mark the
