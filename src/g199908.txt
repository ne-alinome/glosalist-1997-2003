    Were I to suggest adding Glosa to the repertoire, this would only tend
to compound the size problem.
    However, If I have time I would like to see how your selection for the
IGLOS has worked out.

P.S. Have you an extract showing only English and IGLOS?

Robin,

    I moved the Glosa world wide web pages off of GeoCities because of
their new policy after having been taken over by Yahoo! and the issues
of copyright.  As an interim measure I moved them to my own service
provider.  However, I have only a finite amount of disk space before I
have to pay a surcharge.  Also, as you are aware, I am no longer an
active supporter of Glosa.  If you know of someone who would be willing
to take the pages over intact, I would prefer to relinquish them and
reclaim the disk space for personal use.

Mi Plu Amika,
  Paul has been very helpful in the past with Glosa, but now he is moving
on.
  He set up an excellent site for Glosa webpages, and these are well known.
  Now he wishes to off-load this info from his system, so I am seeking
another, who would take these pages on.
  If you might be interested, please visit Paul's site to see what yoou
could be gaining.  Knowing Paul's attiitudes, I imagine that he feels the
complete site should be transferred, IN ITS ENTIRITY, to another location.
Of course, it can be upgraded and personalised to suit the temperament of a
new owner.

  Paul's reference to copyright laws is not a real worry.  There is nothing
that the Glosa authors would object to.  The only item they have banned
from the Internet is the Glosa 6000 dictionary, and I send this per
computer disk to Glosalist subscribers, on request.

  If yoou are interested, please send me a message abouut it.  I have told
Paul I will treat the request as uurgent.

Saluta,
   Robin

Saluta Robin,
The file is 700k in zipped form.
2Mb. in extracted form
will give you English, Interlingua,
French, German, Spanish,
Italian and Portuguese...

it is by no means a finished product
by which I mean some terms
need to be added... the full project
also includes the Esperanto
terms up till letter F, the Volapuk
terms up to M and Latino sine
Flexione pretty much completed...
I'm also including Ekspreso
terms and considering Novial and
or Interlingue/Occidental.
Glosa would be a great addition!
The longer the file gets the
more unwieldly (sp?) it becomes,
though. What are the copyright
restrictions on making lists
available for Glosa words???

I can appreciate how the size
may hinder some from using
the iGLOS. I can always truncate
a special request list...
it is very easy to extract...
an English / Interlingua section
could become its own glossary
easily. This will cut down on
the size considerably. If you wish...
I can make one available.
at the site... just give me a couple
of days. :-)

Also a possibility is cutting the
glossary into alphabetical sections
thus the pieces would be smaller
and more manageable. But a
great advantage of having it all
as a big file is being able to
surf around in it hunting from
term to term and at your whim
jumping from one letter section to
another noticing the similarities
and derivations in vocabulary.
It's research value is what I'm
really interested in. However
there is some housekeeping
still needed and the file will keep
improving with use.

So, give me a couple of days and
I'll try to post a smaller version... or
even versions... if there is interest
like one natural language and an
IAL selections. etc...

Since,
Jay B.

Saluta,
I have found two providers of free space to
be very accomodating... one is Intercosmos.com
and the other is Webjump.com . I like the set up
with Intercosmos better because you can easily
view pages as you've sent them without annoying
blinking banners... the only ads are a pop up window
a la Geocities. With Webjump you have to have the
ability of seeing frames... which of course show ad
banners.

Try out intercosmos.com... If you wish I could arrange
an account there... and give access to change to
whoever will be maintaining the pages.

Since,

   I for one am unable to see frames (though that MAY change in

    Two questions on your e-post:
  . was your message on a half-width column for a reason?
  . though your e-address is  jjbowks{at}cheshire{dot}net  when do you use the
@adam.cheshhire.net  form in your "Return Address"?

    I take it that it is now safe to tell Paul Bartlett that he can clear
his Website of the Glosa pages; perhaps you have already done this.

Cc: Robin Gaskell
Date: Fri, 06 Aug 99 13:3

Ave!

Robin, I received the disk today.

I have not been able to take part in Glosalist because: 1) the
hostilities with the Esperantists got pretty ugly and that has consumed
much of my time and energy (I am somewhat exhausted), and 2) I am
currently without phone service (My mum owes an awful lot of money to
the company) since three weeks ago. I have been barely able to follow
what has been happening in the list using my dad's laptop (that's why
the sender appears as "Luis Alberto Alegrett") from other phones. The
first reason is the one I most hate, since the time the Esperantists
make me waste I could have used to study Glosa.

I can't see the disk's content today. My PC's monitor burnt and it's
being fixed. The laptop's diskette unit doesn't work and its keyboard is
malfuctioning (I had to connect an external keyboard). Well, it seems
that the Esperantists gave me the evil eye, and I'm jinxed. (I am sort
of afraid of seeing the diskette since with my current luck I could see
the last of the virus that struck you...); but as for the leaflet, I'll
translate into Spanish almost inmediatly, and I'll try to pick some
strenght to translate it into Glosa as an exercise, as you said.

In the warning about not translating "Glosa has no grammar", you also
mean the whole paragraph about G. Bernard Shaw? You're quite right about
the "Glosa has no..." statement, it has to be handled with care. Not as
much as maybe discouraging, but as it could be used ditorted by the
fanatic Esperantists of the UEA as something against Glosa. They take
ridiculous pride in their "16 rules", although most of them have nothing
to do with grammar. But since their propaganda is so strong...

But I suppose that "Glosa has no grammar in the popular understandig of
the term..., etc." is actually good, and is to be translated?

This is the leaflet I suppose I will include in a Spanish Glosa website.
I have been using Tripod for my pages (formerly the Venezuelan
Esperantist website), and it gives me 11 Mb. But if you know of
something better and with bigger capacity (just hoping for a better
future!), please tell me.

As for a question about Glosa... in the "Glosa Basic Reference" I found
in Robin's website, in the Glosa terms for "with" appear "sin" and "ko",
and I don't understand it well. Could anybody show me with examples
their use and how Glosa handles the different uses of "with" in English?
Also "homo" and "iso"confuse me a little. A willing (although currently
a little depressed) beginner shall thank you.

Plu amiko saluta,

Daniel.

P. S.: My dad will travel to England (Liverpool mostly, but maybe also
London) in a few days. Does anyone know what he can get me there that is
Glosa-related? In the leaflet the "18 steps to fluency in Euro-Glosa" is
mentioned and I am interested. Does anyone knows how he (my father) can
get it, and if there's something else?

   Ave!

   Mi mite a u Glosa-fa ko u-ci grama, plu traduce exercise, qi Robin pa dice a mi.

   Mi nece aprende boni Glosa. Vi fu dice a mi, si mi pa boni traduce in Glosa.

   Mi pluso mite a vi, u traduce-ra in Hispano-lingua. Robin alo vi pote inklude id in se reti-lo, in ali reti-lo si vi volu akti so, alo in neo reti-lo.

   Plu amiko saluta,

   Daniel.

U solutio

   Id es tem pro komplementa plu pan-munda elektroni exploita, pluso ko lingua kompli. U Munda Lingua es lingua, qi panto-pe, u skience-pe alo u Munda Tri artisana, pote uti e logi pro pan-speci de inter-natio komunika.

   Id nece es facili, ampli e pluso flexuoso, qo pote adapta se e es abili, pro responde omni petitio de u Moderni Munda in Skience, Teknologi, Sporta, Religio, e Komercia.

Plu Latino e Greko lingua radika

   U amonta de plu Latino e Greko lingua radika in plu vokabulari de plu omni principali Euro lingua (klu Ruso lingua), es grosi, e id rapidi du ge auge. [How is it "Professor"?] (?)Eduka-pe Hogben pa dice: "U pan-munda skience vokabulari es u maxi proxi ra ad u vokabulari de u vera Globi Lingua, qi Homi ankora pa gene kompli. Id deriva se plu verbi ex bi morta lingua: Latino e Greko."

   Simeon Potter, Eduka-pe de England-lingua, akorda: "Na nu pote vide, en u-ci du kresce skience vokabulari, u vaticina de u krase inter-natio lingua."

   So, plu-ci Greko e Latino radika habe u potentia pro kompli, qo ne-dubita ankora fu es se maxi gravi participa: supli u vokabulari pro u Munda Lingua.

   U-ci es traduce de "Euro-Glosa" in Hispano-lingua.
