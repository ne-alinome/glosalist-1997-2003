Hi friends,
	I hope to see more attempts at using Glosa, but wish to get this list
running because it serves its subscribers.

	Hence, I write this message in English, to encourage English language
responses.  Please send in questions about Glosa ... writing in English.  I
will of course give English language translations of any Glosa that I use
on this list.

To Recap.

Glosa uses the unadorned Roman script.
Its vocab. is from Greek and Latin roots.
The pronunciation is with Italian vowels and generalised European
consonants (one letter has one sounding).
The sentence construction uses the logical pattern of English (phrases
are "head final" with the main concept word after the modifiers).

Why did the dog cross the road?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
U kanis transiti u via.		[The dog crosses the road.]

U bruno kanis pa transiti u lati via. [The brown dog crossed the wide 
  .........................................  street.]
U mega bruno kanis pa transiti u fo lati via.  [The very large brown
...................................  dog crossed the very wide road.]

Tem u mega bruno kanis pa-du transiti u fo lati via, u celero rubi vagona
pa pasa id.
  	[While the large brown dog was crossing the very wide road, a fast red
car passed it.]

Qe, u celero rubi vagona pa pasa u mega bruno kanis tem id pa du transiti u
via?
	[Did the fast red car pass the large brown dog while it was crossing the
road?]

Tri mega bruno kanis, ko mu pusi ju-fe proprio-pe, pa du transiti u lati
via tem mu tanto pa gene ge morta ex u celero-moti rubi sporta vagona.

	[Three large brown dogs, with their small girl owner, were crossing the
wide street when they almost got killed by a fast-moving
red sports car.]

Exercise: Why did the man sail his boat?
......... ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Un andra ago u navi.	[The man sails the boat.]

Make up sentences to fill out the story; you might use some of the following:-

pisci : fish .... plu undu : the waves .....venti : wind .. tele : far

hidra : water ..... kapti : capture ..... mari : sea ..... nekto : swim

kosta : coast ... arena : sand .... gina : wife (woman) ... 

verdi : green ... vora : eat ... tempestu : storm ... nebula : cloud

Did she enjoy the fish, or .......... ?

Happy writing.
Saluta,

    One remark one sometimes (often?) reads about Glosa is that it is
just relexified English -- merely English with funny words substituted
almost one-for-one.  In which case, why learn Glosa?  Why not just
learn English?  Although the charge of relexification may not be
strictly true in absolutely every instance, many of the samples of
Glosa that I have seen seem to give some credence to the charge.

    One example of this is overuse of tense and mood markers in Glosa
to ape English usage.  If tense or mood is clear, then why mark it?  If
a clause indicates past time, why redundantly mark it in every clause
if the time reference does not change?  If Glosa is merely English
with other words substituted, then what value does it have when with a
little more effort, somebody could have the "real thing"?  Are there
any users of Glosa who do *NOT* know English (not necessarily on this
list)?  If so, how do they use markers?

Subject: What is Good Syntax?
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Fri, 07 Nov 97 18:5

Saluta a vi de u Glosalist.

	In English again, sorry.

	What is good syntax?  Is this question important in English and/or Glosa?

	Do speakers of English automatically know what is good syntax - by virtue
of having learnt English?  Or is the use of syntax something that is
hard-wired into our brains anyway, and, if so, does this mean that the
syntax we use is, by definition, automatically good?

	It has been stated that Glosa has no morphological grammar (no
part-of-speech markers, verb inflections or noun mood markers), and this
has been oversimplified by the Glosa authors to saying Glosa has "no
grammar," which, to the linguistically educated, is like waving a red rag
to a bull.
	It has been stated, by me, that Glosa has "syntax-based" grammar. But is
there truth in this?  To the literate speaker of a national language, Glosa
could really appear to have no grammar; and, for those who wish to begin
writing Glosa, there is sometimes trouble in knowing where to start. 

	So, the question remains: if Glosa is a real language, and there fore has
a grammar, where does this grammar reside?
	If, as the authors say, it is in the ordering of the words, then is it
possible for people to use Glosa with either good or bad grammar?
Is Glosa with bad grammar Glosa that has bad syntax; and, obversely,is
Glosa with good grammar Glosa that has good syntax?

	The question is circular.  But, please ponder the concept of syntax.
Because, if syntax cannot be pondered upon, Glosa is lost.

	The Chinese learn a language with no morphological grammar (characters,
like words in Glosa, do not change for reasons of grammar).
They pick up the tricks of the trade by learning classical Chinese poetry
by rote, and in their brains, the whole syntactical system kicks into gear.

	Perhaps Glosa could be taught similarly, but I feel that adults can't just
soak up the Glosa word order system simply by reading "Plu Glosa Nota."
	Children can learn Glosa by reading Children's stories in Glosa, but
adults are past that stage in their neural development, and most adults
need to approach language-learning from a rule-based direction.

	And, to get back to the original question: is there such a thing as good
syntax; and, if there is such a thing, can it be defined in relation to
Glosa; and, if so, can it be identified and taught to adult learners?

	Please let us hear your ideas on this.  It is certainly no use for me to
go on, and on, about the syntax of Glosa if this is seen as a hollow
concept by those who might learn and use the language.

	What does the panel think!?  Are there any questions?

Saluta,
 Robin
	P.S. Of course I have opinions on the matter, but will add the next
chapter after reading your responses to this one.

 . Good syntax in English is good syntax ... why not use it in Glosa?
 . There is a lot of bad English about: Glosa does not ape these errors.
 As I have tried to say, before: well-written Glosa translates, almost
word for word, into English, but we can't say the reverse of this is     true.
 . There is legal, correct English with all the "I's" dotted and "T's"
crossed.  Then there is the highly "elided" back-fence variety (with many
function words missing). 
	x The Glosa authors have, on occasion, pointed to a more 'vernacular' form
of Glosa - describing it as "telegramatic."
	x Paul feels that punctilious use of tense particles, for instance, makes
the language stodgey and unnecessarily wordy, so that omitting them, when
the time implied is fully understood, would give a more rational form.
	x I have erred on the school-book side of the balance ... knowing that it
is very much easier for learners to drop (elide) assumable function words,
than it is to learn to use them later, when their presence becomes
necessary.  I feel that having learners start with the abbreviated form of
Glosa puts them at a disadvantage, later.

	This theory about learning the full or abbreviated form of a language can
be bourne out through psychological and educational reasoning, but this
does not prove it is true.  The pattern I see as working best involves the
teaching of full grammar first, then having students gradually drop the
redundant words as they gain a feel for the language.

	Paul corrected none of the examples I gave, so I will attempt an
abbreviation, myself:-

   I gave the sentence:
Qe, u celero rubi vagona pa pasa u mega bruno kanis tem id pa du transiti u
via?

   It could have been:
Qe, u celero rubi vagona pa pasa u mega bruno kanis tem id du transiti u via?

   Does the second sentence still mean:
	[Did the fast red car pass the large brown dog while it was crossing the
road?]

	Please comment.  Which would you feel more comfortable learning? Which
feels more "natural" (with all the psychological loadings that that word
carries)? 
	Paul's answer is fairly clear:-
>    One example of this is overuse of tense and mood markers in Glosa
>to ape English usage.  If tense or mood is clear, then why mark it?  If
>a clause indicates past time, why redundantly mark it in every clause
>if the time reference does not change? 
	____________________________________

	Paul's other criticism is possibly more crucial.  

>	[  ......  ]   If Glosa is merely English
>with other words substituted, then what value does it have when with a
>little more effort, somebody could have the "real thing"? 

... and especially ... > Are there
>any users of Glosa who do *NOT* know English (not necessarily on this
>list)?  If so, how do they use markers?

	How do the Glosa authors get feedback, about Glosa, from people who are
not English-speakers?  Clark, Ashby and I all have English as our first
Language (L1); I am not fluent in other national languages, but Clark and
Ashby are.

	Glosa dictionaries exist in German, French, Spanish, Swahili and Chinese,
so there should be non-speakers -of-English with whom I can communicate in
Glosa.

	Paul also feels that Glosa info should be written out in other languages -
to introduce the concept to people outside of the English-speaking
community.  I agree, and if I knew how to publish them to their intended
audience, would ask the Glosa authors to prepare such translations.

	Please make your suggestions on how we might overcome the English-language
barrier.

Saluta,
 Robin

I heard this constantly when I first began to put Speedwords on the web. It is only
relexified English. My response was, a Spaniard, or a German would say the same thing.
It is relexified Spanish, etc. And, in fact, it seems to me, from one perspective,
Spanish is nothing but relexified English, that is, just substituting one word of
Spanish for one word of English and or vice versa. So is German, French, Dutch,
Japanese, Russian, etc. Although I may be looking at this too simplistically, I do not
see this as an argument against Glosa or Speedwords. If we use Spanish as an example
with a simple sentence, then what is the difference?

Mi amigo es Miguel.
My friend is Miguel.

Looks like the same argument to me.

However, what if we do this?
Mi amigo es Miguel.
Ji ar e Miguel.

Well, based on Paul's argument, and others, why, Speedwords is nothing more than
relexified Spanish, to the Spaniard, and relexified English to the English speaker.

How about this?

Miguel tiene el libro de mi.
Miguel ha l bu d j.
Miguel ha ji bu.
Miguel has the book of me.
Miguel has my book.
Either version of Speedwords, or English, is understandable to the reader who knows
them, and either way, the correct meaning is transferred, which is what an auxiliary
language should do, or the learning of another natlang should do.One translation
follows the Spanish "de mi" and the other follows the English equivalent "my book".

All language, to me, seems to be one form or another of "relexification". And, right
or wrong, I look at such an argument as a strawdog. It is a tool to help each
individual bolster their reason not to learn a specific language. In reality, they
prefer another one more than likely, and this is a way to add weight to the decision.
In Paul's case this may not be true, but then again, I often make a final decision
based on what someone else considers a non-argument.

A friend of mine said one could not use Speedwords in this context. A Japanese could
not write Speedwords as a shorthand system for Japanese and have a Russian who knew
Speedwords understand it. So, I put together some sentences and asked the friend to
translate them. He did, and so did some others. Their response was, it appeared
different than what they expected Speedwords to do, but they did translate correctly
and understood the translation. After the fact I told them I had used Speedwords to
translate in Japanese word order, word for word. Point, it worked, Speedwords worked
when it was not supposed to work. Although I did not have a Russian to work with, I
did have an English speaker and a Portuguese speaker and a Chinese speaker, one of my
T'ai Chi students.

My point is this. From what I have seen of Glossa, although I am not fluent in it, or
even a real beginner yet, I believe it will and does work just as well. Hogben wrote
in his Interglosa book that linguists often did not know what actually worked for the
rank and file, [my paraphrase from memory] but only what should work for the
"educated" linguist not dealing with the real world of language speakers, i.e. the
ordinary average barely educated person to the educated. So, it appears to me that
these questions are interesting to speculate upon, but in reality have nothing to do
with real world usage.
I have studied Russian, Spanish, Koine Greek, Speedwords, some French, Japanese when
living in Japan, a touch of Hebrew, and beginning, along with my daughter, to look
into Chinese more indepth. Seems like they all could be a "strange" form of
"relexified" English to me. Depends on how I would want to argue the case. Yet, the
Russian, etc. would say I don't know what I'm talking about. Their language is not
English.

I would suspect it is more important to actually use the language Glosa, or whatever,
versus argue why it won't work or is not needed because it is "relexified" whatever.
Bumble bees can't fly according to the scientist, yet the Bumblebee doesn't seem to
pay atterntion to what they say it can't do. So it is with Speedwords, and Glosa, from
what I see at my level of experience and usage. All the things I heard Speedwords
can't do, it does do, and I suspect the same is true of Glosa. The way to find out is
to use it.

Hope all is well with everyone on the list.

Bob

    I will respond here to just a few excerpts from both of Robin's
recent posts on Glosalist.  I do not take issue with everything.

On Fri, 7 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

    Can we even meaningfully speak of "good syntax" apart from any
particular language?  I honestly do not know.  There may be Chomskyan
types who believe in some sort of deep grammar which includes syntax. 
However, I think it would be more practical to skip such high-blown
talk and merely deal with Glosa on an immediate, practical level.

    See above.  I think we need to get practical.  I think Robin's
one-time grammar statement was very useful, although I differed on a
couple of details, as I recall.  I think something like this should be
pursued, as long as Ashby&Clark don't try to pull a Schleyer on people.

    Definitely.  Personally I think this was a blunder on the part of
the principals.  Even to some of us who are not professional linguists
or polyglots (or polymaths :-) ), it was/is a ridiculous statement.

    If we come up with an effective propaedeutic, do we even need to
answer this question?

    And here I had always assumed that Chinese children learned their
native language from their elders, the way other children do. :-)  I did
not learn English from the cradle by reciting Shakespeare and Milton.

    I haven't even seen a copy of "Plu Glosa Nota" in a couple of
years.  However, this is precisely my objection to the "Mechanics of
Glosa" approach.  It consists of paradigmatic sentences divorced from
context.  Children do not learn their mother tongues from a grammar
book.  But neither do they learn outside of an environment.  They learn
with all sorts of verbal feedback and non-verbal cues from their
elders.  This feedback is missing from the "Mechanics of Glosa."  That
is why I disagree with the principals and think that a language
description is crucial.

> syntax[?]

   Personally I don't even think the question needs to be answered.
 

On Sun, 9 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

    Fair enough.  But why English?  Why not the syntax of some other
language?  I am not saying Glosa should _not_ use English syntax (more
or less, because English does retain a few residual inflections which
Glosa does not have).  I just think we need to make our assumptions
clear.

    Yes, but I think this is unwise on the whole.  It seems to mimic
elliptical, colloquial English.  A Glosa-speaker who does not know
English could be thrown off by this style.  As I understand it, the
purpose of Glosa is to facilitate communication, not to baffle.

    I am primarily saying that we should take into consideration various
speech habits of non-Indo-European languages.  Do they have anything to
teach us?

    Actually, I think the sentence would be just as clear even without
the 'du' in the second clause.

    What "feels more 'natural'" may be so conditioned by our native
speech habits that I think the concept is more or less meaningless.

> 	Paul's answer is fairly clear:-
> >[...]
> >if the time reference does not change? 

    This last clause is crucial.  It the time reference _does_ change,
or if the aspect (which English marks confusingly) is critical, then by
all means mark them.  In the example sentence, the time reference does
not change and the aspect in the subordinate clause is not critical.

    This one I really don't know.  When Volapük and Esperanto were
published, "modern" communications consisted of surface mail and the
electric telegraph.  I don't even recall whether undersea cables had
been laid yet (1887 for Esperanto).  And yet they went further, faster,
than most recent auxiliary language projects.  I really don't know why.

    What do I think Glosa really needs?

1)  A language description intelligible to average people regarding
usage.  It does not have to be in a format that would thrill a
professional linguist: just make it practical and unambiguous.  (Robin,
do you still have your proposed grammar statement you sent me a year or
two ago?  I can't seem to find a copy.)

2)  A SETTLED core vocabulary.  "Glosa 1000" does not exist in a
settled form, as I have remarked many times before.  At the same time,
I think that Glosa 6000 is overkill.  Lists such as Essential World
English, the Longman Definig Dictionary (I think it's called), and the
Universal Language Dictionary would seem to indicate that a base
vocabulary of 1500 - 2000 *judiciously* selected words (apart from
proper names and specialist terminology) would be adequate.  I honestly
don't know how the current Glosa wordlists were selected.  But if we
use too large a vocabulary, we partially cut the ground from under the
attempt to make the language more or less easily learnable by adult
users.

3)  Dispersion.  And I admit that this one stumps me.  There is also
the issue of not "dialectizing" Glosa between Internet and non-Internet
users.  (A&C are not even part of this discussion, but they do hold
copyrights.  I just hope they would not try to pull a Schleyer.)

of this combined list.  It just needs to be able to express things.  
The combined list is just intended to be a starting resource.

Nicely done, Paul! I'm already using it in two ways:

   To find out what words are missing in Glosa 6000.

   To construct a Glosa Core Vocabulary, as you once suggested,
   by removing words from the Basic Dictionary that aren't also
   found in the Artificial Languages Base Vocabulary.

I'm still calling the dictionaries the 6000 Series and the 1000 Series,
though it looks like they're going to be closer to 7500 and 2500 words.
Perhaps I'll just leave the names alone, have it be one of those "For
Historical Reasons" kind of things. On the other hand, calling them
Glosa 7000 and Glosa 2500 would distinguish them from the others. But
first I'll wait until I can make a better estimate.

A new page, also accessible from my main Glosa page, shows the words
which are in the Artificial Languages Base Vocabulary but not in
Glosa 6000...

http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/omission.htm

Also, the other two pages and the dictionary files have been updated.

Has anybody had trouble downloading those selfextracting dictionary
files? My browser doesn't seem to want to download executables via
ftp. It downloads other binary files - just plain zipfiles for example.

    As I have mentioned in Glosa circles, I think that Glosa 6000 is
overkill for Glosa's purposes but that "Glosa 1000" does not exist in 
a consistent manner in Glosa Education Organization publications and
may be inadequate.  I suspect that a roughly 2000-word vocabulary would
be better.

    Four days ago I posted the above notice.  Since then it has been
pointed out to me that there appear to be a few errors in the file.  
I have corrected some of the manifest errors.  However, the following
words occur as such in one of the source files, and it is not
immediately obvious in context what the intended words are, although
some guessing may be in order:

bup
getween
sib
slef

As before, you use this information "at your own risk."

Paul,Another thanks for the list. I have the EWE book, and Basic, but not the
Longman Defining Vocab. What is the story with the Longman vocabulary?

You have saved me some time as I was working on a similar project. However, I
was also going to "adjust" the list you have done by comparing it with the
Pitman 700, the Gregg 500, the Silverberg 422, and other "most frequently
used word" studies.

Speaking of Basic's vocabulary. There was a "minimised" list of the 850 words
to a 600 word list. Finally found the list. Originally it was mentioned in a
book on Basic's vocabulary but someone had torn the page out with the 600
list. Turns out it was in another book by Ogden that I had just bought.
"Opposition."

I think it is a valid and important point to build IAL vocabularies on
studies like the above. IMO vocabularies should be based on frequency of
daily use, universally accepted words, words of similar spelling sound and
meaning in multiple languages, etc. And, a small highly functional vocabulary
that would expand through experience and actual usage.

Anyway, thanks again for the list and effort to do it.

Al l sue,
Bob

I know of its existence but somehow I've still not quite got
around to ordering it, along with some of the other materials
that I'd like to have. You mention one cassette; are there more?
One thing I'd like to see, and which Robin may be providing, is
a large number of cassettes, so that I can immerse myself in the

Hmmmm. I did a wordcount tonight, and was surprised to find that my
current Glosa-English 6000 source file contains 5989 Glosa entries.
Not bad! Some of those are compounds (lowering the count), and I'll
be adding a few new ones (raising the count), so it will probably end
up not too far from 6000 unique words.

*	Since sending this, Bill Patterson has placed the list in his Webpages
- ready for printing.  Also he has listed the 'synonyms' that he has not
been able to decide upon, asking for a group-think on the matter. 

	Bill has located the work in the two following locations:-
   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm
   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/synonyms.htm

He has also used a password to get into  /glosa.htm  and this is 
   [not here anymore because this file is now public]

	Actually, the plot thickens: I had the "Glosa 1000" list and the "Glosa
6000" list in two parts of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.  So, laboriously, I
compiled a single, all-encompassing list by collapsing both lists together.

	After that, I decided that it would be best if we had the related
English-to-Glosa list equivalent to this newly compiled "Glosa 6000+" list.

	So, I used Galaxy, my trusty ASCII word processor, and DOS's LIST.EXE to
''reverse'' the list, so that
	A(D) at,towards

produced the obverse listings
	at A(D)  and
	towards A(D)

So, as you can guess, with alternative English words and phrases the list
grew.

But what was not expected was the plethora of Classical synonyms that
turned up for many English words.  I was led to believe that there might
legitemately be 
a Latin and a Greek word for one English word, EG
	water AQA, HIDRA

but some English words yielded five, six or seven 'synonyms.'  This created
a  real problem for me in something that I had expected to be straightforward.

	Our thinking was that there might be (at least) three levels of the _Glosa
6000_ dictionary:-
	. A _Learner's Dictionary_ in which only one Glosa word is given for each
English Language word - no synonyms;
	. A _Standard Dictionary_ in which a suitable single synonym would be
given for commonly-used words, e.g. aqa and hidra for water.
	. A _Literary Dictionary_ in which all possible alternative are listed,
with probably one preferred usage and a likely synonym indicated, followed
by the alternative possible forms.  Note: if there was a synonym in both
Latin and Ancient Greek, that means an English-language word generates at
least four Classical equivalents!

	This might explain why it is a 'work in progress.'  Bill Patterson has
been silent for a few months, while he worked on sorting out the good
synonyms from the bad ones.  He has now asked for help with refiining the
difficult cases.

	I would like to see a _First Glosa Dictionary_ that did give one
Classical word as the preferred Glosa usage, but which might, for some
words, indicate a second Classical word as the synonym.  This would allow
some literary freedom from the start, and avoid the need for making
possibly unnecessary choices between two likely words ... allowing the
second choice to be listed in the synonym position.  
	Paul Bartlett, prefers, however, to avoid any possible confusion by
keeping, in the first instance, to a single Glosa word for each English
lexeme.
	I have just started writing again to the Glosa-pe in Uganda.  This matter
of the dictionary preferences of beginners is one question I must ask.

	Very soon I will download Bill Patterson's work on this, and am keen to
see what he has decided to be the best constitution for a Beginner's
Dictionary.

	Jay, please try Glosa by translating something yourself, or telling a
story in your own (Glosa) words.  This was what Bill Patterson did to test
the language: he chose to attempt translation of "The Wolf" into Glosa, and
did, I feel, discover that Glosa was up to the job.

Saluta,
 Robin

I really do want to see what you have done, Bill.
	So, by adding and subtracting, you have come back to the first number the
Glosa authors thought of: 6000.

	We still have the basic wordlist from Paul Bartlett, who is firmly
convinced that 2500 words would be adequate and a reasonable learning load,
while claiming that 6000 words represents some form of linguistic over-kill.

	How might we, in Glosa, deduce the right number, and selection, of words
for a First Dictionary that would be suitable for use in all cultures?

	Perhaps there is no alternative to actual field trials with test
populations.  This is where I came in.  I was writing letters to Africans
and other Third Worlders ... and I wondered how I could release more
dictionaries, in the field, without actually going broke.  The question
still remains: the thinner the starter dictionary the lower the costs in
paper and postage.  So there is a pragmatic reason for finding the minimum
starter dictionary, as well as a linguistic one!

	My first thought was to ship the S/H luggable computer, I bought for A$80,
to my friends in Uganda, following this with a simple printer, then feeding
them with paper and printer ribbons.  This was a brilliant idea for cutting
down on air postage costs, but was knocked out by import duties into
Uganda.  The computer and a A$50 S/H printer would have clocked up an
import bill of around US$1000.  And I was advised not to travel personally
to Uganda with the items in my luggage, because this would end in my being
gaoled as a smuggler.

	So, unless anyone can get to a Ugandan embassy to collect the papers for
application as a Non-Governmental Organisation, exempt from import duty, it
looks like thinner dictionaries is the way to go.

	Back to the drawing board?  Any ideas?

Saluta,
 Robin

I've been hitting the synonyms pretty hard this weekend (and some of
the omissions) because I really want to wrap those up before I print
out another copy of the dictionaries. Then I'll hit the Omissions List.
That's where we can be really creative; invent your own Glosa word!

until I finish the synonyms.

It wasn't so much the synonyms that bothered me. The *homonyms* were
what bogged me down for a while! That was very slow going and after
an evening of dehomonymizing, I usually lacked either the time or
the motivation to hit it again. But now I'm making some rapid progress.
I ended up with a single Glosa-English source file (GE6000S.TXT), with
each record being of the form GLOSAWORD = ENGLISHWORD (or phrase, as
the case may be). Preferred synonyms are marked with a leading *. Then
I wrote procedures that read this source file and arrange the synonyms
according to the splats (stars (*)) and remove the splats (stars (*))
and swap and sort and create all of the dictionaries and zipfiles and
synonyms and omissions files. So after making changes to the source
file, all I need to do is enter 'make all' and sit back for a few
minutes and then upload the results.

I hope to be getting back to "U Lupus" by next week. Unfortunately a
business trip within the next few weeks is a definite possibility. So
I may be delayed. Oh, well.

Robin, I think your computer's clock needs resetting. :-)

    I hope I made it clear in my follow-up that I do *not* think that
there needs to be a one-for-one correspondence between the list I
posted and a basic Glosa vocabulary.  Therefore, if the list has
approximately X number of words, that does not mean that the basic
vocabulary also must have X number of words.  The question becomes, 
Can the basic vocabulary express what the list expresses, however 
many words the basic vocabulary needs to do that?

    The Longman Defining Vocabulary contains about 2250 English words,
Supposedly, in terms of these words any other English word can be
(eventually) defined.  Now it could be that some Glosa basic words may
not correspond precisely to any single Longman word.  After all,
nothing says that Glosa (or any other IAL) *has* to be nothing more
than a relexification of English (or any other natlang).

    Those times that I have tried to write Glosa using the list of
roughly 1600 words I collated from different supposedly "Glosa 1000"
lists, I sometimes found myself jumping through mental hoops trying to
express what I wanted to say.  That is why my estimate for a basic
vocabulary is in the 2000 - 2500 range.  However, it is true that
greater familiarity and use may make expression easier with a given
base vocabulary.  I confess that I have not actually used Glosa all
that much.  Since I did collate the basic reference from actual G.E.O.
"Glosa 1000" publications, that is what I tried to use.

    On the other hand, if actual use shows need for a few more words
than the collated list, then if they are available from Glosa 6000, all
the better.  But I still maintain that Glosa 6000 is overkill.

    In my mind it comes down in part to the intended use for the
language.  Zamenhof originally published Esperanto with basic
communication in mind, so far as I know, and the original set of roots
was in the 800 - 900 range, together with the lexical affixes to extend
their use.  Subsequently, a number of users tried to use Esperanto
considerably for belles lettres, and they started using a lot more
words, and using more words in different ways that are not always
apparent to new learners.  I am not saying that they were wrong.  But
it seems to me that some Esperantists have gotten away from the
language's original intent to easing international, intercultural
communications.

    Some have argued that belletristic use of Esperanto has helped keep
it going.  That may be.  But that argument immediately brings up the
question in my mind whether the language (or any IAL) would have
survived for its original intent.  I once exchanged two letters in
Glosa with a man in China.  We needed a basic vocabulary to
communicate, not one to produce literature to win the Nobel Prize.

    The proof of the pudding is in the eating, and the proof of an
auxiliary language is in the using.  By the way, does anyone know if
Ashby&Clark are even aware of this Internet activity and whether they
might try to cause problems with copyright?  (Before I put up the Glosa
web pages, I went to the trouble to get their explicit permission and
to attach their copyright.)

Excussssse me???? RLR IS ALSO A  SHORTHAND SYSTEM that can be used for
shortening email, or any printed matter. It is only an AUXLANG when the
international language principles are used. I was, as I said in a previous
post, going to begin writing ALL my email with the 26 RLR words and the &.
This is the flexibility of Speedwords. Even on the auxlang I am not using
RLR as an auxlang. Just read Ray's last question about why I used the word
"that" the way I did. I already have a discussion list where I use RLR
fully as an auxlang and only those wanting to do so with me must sign up
for the list. If this is such an offense to you I will be glad to
discontinue using it as a shorthand system for Paul's sake, on this list.
Is there not a topic on any of these lists about languages where someone is
not offended over every little thing?

P.S. In most cases I always close with Al l sue, no matter what the list
is. Hope that doesn't offend anyone. Sometimes I use Mil gra.

		I'm really not at all sure.  From A&C I learned that he gave them the 
go-ahead to make what changes they wanted, but I thought that much got 
lost in the process.  For example, the ingenious verb system, though 
difficult at first, is really simple and can work after a while spent 
learning it.  It is central to Ig, and Glosa is very much different 
because of the changes.  They are more than a simplification, though.

		I can't say.  It's my impression that he dropped it 
(during the war), even though it apparently did arouse some interest in 
Britain, at least.  Perhaps he tired of it or thought better of it.  To 
many it might seem very complex (a false impression).  I have seen 
criticisms of it that claim he is not a linguist (but then, Zamenhof, 
A&C, and Petry never claimed to be, either. :) )

>what

		Many principles are the same:  no accidence (which is 
really what A&C mean when they say "no grammar" (i.e., no changes in 
words for grammatical meaning); use of Graeco-Latin word bases (though G 
changes spellings); word-order and small particles to mark syntax.  The 
most significant change is the loss of Ig's verb system (which I think is 
a loss of some magnitude).  It is thus only a partial, but 
author-endorsed "rewrite."

> Hope these are appropriate questions.
		They are, indeed, and I am interested in your impression of 
these attempts at answers and your reaction to both Ig and G.

None taken. Funny though, I though we were students of language. And, I
have not had one such comment like these from people I send email to who
are not on any language list at all, just exchanging messages with me on
business or personal matters. The only place I have received any comments
like these are on language related lists???

I do not wish to have this reply be misconstrued. This is not trying to
justify anything, it is not to create an argument, nor is it to continue a
thread. That would not be appropriate for the Glosa list. Therefore, I
will only respond to this thread further if it comes in private email to
me.

I would appreciate more use of the Glosa by Robin, Paul and others who may
know it more, so I can begin to absorb more of it. And, I won't post again
to this list until I can begin writing something in Glosa myself. Nor will
I use RLR here for the shorthand or the aux part of it.

    Probably we can only speculate.  Interglossa came out _during_ the
Second World War when, shall we say, people had other things on their
minds.  Then, after the war, Britain had a lot of rebuilding to do.  I
don't know if it was ever published as such in other English speaking
countries or whether copies were merely exported to them.  Also, I
myself have found the style of the book a little hard to follow.  (Of
course, others may not.)

    Certainly, the changes fromn Interglossa were due to Ashby and
Clark.  As to *why* they made the changes they did, I don't know, never
having met them or inquired by mail.  But it seems to me as if they
kept some -- not all -- the language but sort of missed its spirit. 
That's why I think that both languages had a lot of possibility but
that Glosa was not entirely well done.  However, I think it is still
salvageable.

    I suppose you meant "Glosa" here.  I really don't know, as Hogben

    I wonder how much Clark and Asbhy actually tried using Interglossa
themselves.  As John Schilke pointed out, the Interglossa verb system
might take a little getting used to, but I think it was a fascinating
idea.  In fact, when I was playing around with a project I called
frater2, I more or less imported Hogben's verb system wholesale with
the addition of one verb (relating to mental/spiritual activity).  I
speculate that Interglossa never really got a good field trial.

    I wouldn't call Glosa a complete rewrite, but I do consider them
separate languages in the sense that Esperanto and Ido are separate
languages.

    Entirely appropriate, I would say.  I have wondered some of these
same things myself, as probably have others.

I've completed the Synonym Analysis. The files are now ready to print.
Future changes will be 1) bugfixes and 2) core words added as necessary.
But the 6000 series files should be pretty stable and complete now.
The core dictionaries will evolve slowly.

I've renamed the files. Since we're not sure how many words we'll end up
with, I removed the 6000s and 1000s from the names. See my Glosa page for
details.

Please tell us some more about the verb system!

OK.  Thanks for the enquiry.
	I am browsing through my (now somewhat tattered) copy of 
_Interglossa_ and will try to summarize the verb ("operator") system as 
best I can.  Actually, if anyone has the ability to scan and copy the 
book to the net, I'd be interested in such a project -- I think it 
worthwhile.
	Anyway....

	Like Glosa, there is no accidence:  the words do not change for 
grammatical function.  The operators end in 'e,' which is a help.  'No' 
is preposited (as a separate word) for 'not,' 'nun' for the present (if 
it is desired to state the tense, 'pre' for the past, and 'post' for the 
future.  These 3 latter are not essential.  Then,

X acte A Y 		X performs the action A on Y
X date A Y		X confers the attribute A on Y
X detecte A Y		X discovers the property A of Y
X dicte A Y		X conveys the communication A to Y
X esthe A Y		X experiences the sentiment A towards Y
X gene A ex Y		X acquires the attribute A from Y
X habe A de Y		X has the attribute A in relation to Y
X perde A causo Y	X loses the attribute A because of Y
X reacte A Y		X responds to the stimulus A applied by Y
X stimule A Y		X evokes the response A from Y
X tene A Y		X conserves the attribute A on behalf of Y
X tracte A apo Y	X withdraws the attribute A from Y

It is immediately clear that Hogben took most of this from the Greek (as 
he explains) and doesn't change spelling very much.

There is also the particle 'ge,' which equals 'pre gene' or provides a 
passive participle  
	u ge dicte verba = the spoken word

For example,
	X date eco Y = X puts up Y (gives shelter to)
	X gene bio = X comes to life
	X tracte claustro apo Y = X opens Y
	X perde chromo = X fades (in color)
	X acte debito = X does his duty
	X dicte no Y = X denies (or refuses) Y
	X stimule volo Y = X tempts Y
	X esthe questio Y = I is curious about Y
		and so on.

The system is really quite ingenious, as I said, but I think that it 
would take a bit of practice to use it well.  Of course, no all possible 
combinations work out to have an English translation, but one need not 
expect them to.

I hope that this gives a bit of the flavor of the system.  There are 
other operators, such as 'mote' 'to move,' but this is fairly complete.

Any questions?
Saluta,
	John     (dicte saluto)
