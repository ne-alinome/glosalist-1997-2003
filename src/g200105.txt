Where things get difficult is how the parts are marked, suffixes word order

Syd, PLEASE don't post any more using that horrible
broken email reader ... It is difficult to read
and difficulter to reply to your posts!!!!
Use anything else. Ask somebody to go through
the config params -- life is too short to decrypt
these every time, even though they are interesting:

All the eurolangs were once heavily suffixing ("synthetic"
and "inflectional"), but gradually they replaced the suffixes
with prepositions to become more "analytic" and "isolating".
Germanic languages have evolved furthest in that direction.

Glosa was intended as a purely analytic/isolating language,
more so than all the other auxlangs. So there are *no* more
case suffixes, just prepositions like "de, ad, ...".

As you mentioned, there is no suffix defined for accusative case
(nominative = "per") but something like "em" could work; otherwise
there is nothing but word order defining those "core cases";
and most of the time, word order is perfectly sufficient.

nominative, ablative      ... first noun phrase, or "per"
accusative, direct object ... second NP, or maybe "em"
dative, indirect object   ... "ad"
genitive, possessive      ... "de"

Those are the core cases; other important cases are "oblique".

Then there are a bunch of other prepositions, too many!
In a truly simple global auxlang, these would be reduced
by composing them out of in/ex/ad/de and just a few more,
e.g. "intra xxx = in middle of xxx".

All languages are similar after all, they just vary in a
relatively few "parameters" such as whether to use mostly
suffixes or prepositions. To make 2nd language learning easy,
an auxlang must be highly regular with few exceptions,
and express many different shades of meaning with the fewest
"pieces", whether words or grammar rules. Ido and Glosa use
nearly opposite approaches, Occidental combines both ...

For a true global interlanguage, no currently existing project
really works, IMO. The ideal would have a much more productive
but smaller vocabulary than Glosa, and an even easier syntax.
I see Glosa as unfinished, and use Occ effectively with Europeans.
The ideal interlanguage would be highly analytical/isolating,
abandoning all suffixes, a further development of Glosa perhaps.
But it would look more like Indonesian or Tahitian. IMHO!

Stating that capitals are purely cosmetic might be OK.
There are some important discourse functions to consider though:
Proper names like Henry, China; acronyms like NATO, UN.
Emphasis like I can't *believe* they *eat* that.
The miniscules are generally more readable but you could
use small caps instead, to minimize learning effort.

Reducing the unneeded letters is also a very good idea.
Q W X Y should disappear. Also, H J Z are candidates.
Any reform of Glosa should carefully consider Frater:

For a global IAL, *much* thought should be given to
ease of pronunciation. The easiest of all is Tunu:
http://members.aol.com/manishtusu/tunu.html

Consider that French/Spanish/Portuguese/etc never
will pronounce an H. Orientals will mix L with R.
Right now without thinking, say "Rosa says so" ...
you said 2 Z's and 2 S's. The choice is to make just
another european greco-latin mix, or a global IAL.

A reasonable phonology *can* please the vast majority.
To see just how common the various consonants are:

The dictionary files on my website have been uploaded again, after I 
finished comparing the data with the book "Glosa 6000".  I made about 
500 additions, corrections or small changes.  The files are now in a 
new directory www.glosa.org/gid . 

"grandina  hall" is corrected to "hail" now, 
"kontende  smuggle" to "struggle", 
"larix  latch" to "larch", 
"pauperi  peer" to "poor", 
"tentakuli  testicle" to "tentacle".

Cool! Now I'm looking through this page:
http://www.glosa.org/gid/gwds.htm

: All you have to do to form your own MegaGlosa
: is to be able to recognize a Latin and Greek root.
: Most of the common ones will be listed in Glosa 1000,
: the others will be in Glosa 6000.

:        Prefix - root - suffix.
:   Eg.  SUPER     FLU     OUS
:
: Remember Glosa has no parts of speech;
: and any Glosa word can act as any part of speech.
: Because the suffix is usually concerned with
: this kind of information, whether the word is verb,
: noun, adjective or adverb it is usually superfluous
: for Glosa and can be removed. 

OK, so all the Latin super-productives are *in*,
officially: RE-FLU-x, Ef-FLU-ent, IN-FLU-ence, etc.

Moreover, all "classical" roots are included. Wow!
The authors were more liberal than I ever dreamed.

: If the Prefix is one with a distinct meaning
: i. e. one of the 35 listed in PGN 36
: this must be retained as it contributes to meaning,
: to information. So generalizing; 
:
:    Word minus suffix = Prefix + root.
:
: the word you want. In the above example the root is FLU,
: to flow, SUPER over; therefore SUPERFLU, overflow. In a way
: forming a Mega Glosa Vocabulary involves 'tail-chopping'. 

So all my arguing way-back-when was "superflu" because
Glosa already accepted these things. We are still left
with the minor but annoying problem of final vowels:

: Many verbs of Latin origin end in -ate. All you have to do
: here is knock off the -te. confiscate becomes KONFISKA. 

: Some words ending -age are of French origin.
: These can be kept giving MESAGE, FOLIAGE. 

What I learn from this is that the authors don't care
much about the final vowels, they just aren't important;
any d**ned thing is good enough.

There are collisions between e.g. Latin BAL=dance and
Greek BAL=throw, but life is too short to worry about it;
natural languages all have homonyms but don't fail to work.

On that basis, half the reforms I thought necessary
for Glosa to work as an IAL, are already done.

This is really difficult question, and I'm not the most erudite:)
But I think we cannot use in Glosa postverb adjective in order to make
pseudo-adverb.
We must use preverb adjective for this reason: I cannot say in Glosa: Mi ski
id boni. for "I know it goodly" (It seems to be not-correct in English too),
but Mi boni ski id is much better variant. They sang beautifully = mu pa
beli soni, isn't it?

In Russian the parts marked by suffixes and endings, in English by the place
in sentence and by suffixes and endings, in Glosa by the place in sentence.

Alex.

The obsolete English grammars use the term "adverb" for some
very different purposes. I think we must distinguish at least 2:

1st "adverb", as an adjective modifier: "a VERY big mistake".
2nd "adverb", as a sentence modifier: "she walked SLOWLY".

>From the glosaref I only found one example, showing that
the authors followed the English pattern as usual:

:: They spoke at the same moment = My pa dice iso-kron.

But "auxiliaries" (fu, pa, etc) precede the verb.
This us the usual pattern in most languages, i.e.
aux on one side of the verb, manner-adverbs on the other.

To disambiguate manner adverbs from objects, add prepositions:
"slowly = in a slow way = at slow speed = with slowness".

Saluta, glosalista!

I wrote a simple multiple-choice vocabulary builder in JavaScript. I've
tested it with with Opera 3.62 and 5.10, IE 5.0, and Netscape 4.75... It
was "fun" getting it to work in all the browsers at hand, even though it
doesn't do anything out of the (what I'd consider) ordinary!

It's at these locations...
   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/exercise/index.htm
   http://www.comtime.com/~ailanto/exercise/index.htm

It is based on files from Marcel's GID and has both English and German
versions. If it works okay in your browser, go ahead and download
the zipfile, and then you can run it offline if you wish. I bundled
everything together, sources and all... you can delete everything but
the *.htm files and it will still work, that's all you need. (The
rest of the files are the sources used by the makefile to rebuild the
webpages when I make corrections.)

- Salata, Bill

Subject: [glosalist] Hungarian information
From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>

Perhaps you remember my mail of 01-05-01 about Ilona Kutas 
Martinovits, a Hungarian woman, who wrote a short story and 
tries to collect translations of it in all possible languages 
( www.mek.iif.hu/porta/szint/human/szepirod/modern/martinov , 
5.3 MB in PDF-format). 

I sent some corrections to her concerning her German version and got 
in exchange for it a translation of an information text about Glosa. 
I am very happy about it.  Perhaps you feel like having a look at it. 
I find it interesting, because Hungarian is very different to the 
other European languages.  

  www.glosa.org 
  www.glosa.org/brevi/index.html 
  www.glosa.org/brevi/magyar.htm 

Needless to say, that she would be happy about any help for her 
book, corrections or new translations.  Her address is 
tenger{at}eszeg{dot}sulinet{dot}hu . 

Saluta - Marcel
