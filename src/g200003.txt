    It was my day off to-day, Friday 10th, but sleep debt prevented me from
going back to see the rest of the _IT2000_ computer exhibition: my body
just said, enough.

   Possibly Sunday I will find time to look at the various Websites that
others have reccommended to me.  I will say that Lexically, you have been
the most active, and I understand this on the basis of each contributing
the part that they resonate with best. 
   In my reply to Marcel, I suggested that he might set up a satellite
Glosa site in Germany, and then encourage others to correspond across the
German/English barrier: I think he inferred that I was not maximising
opportunities for Glosa, and he is right.  If I was still as virile as I
was 20 years ago, when I first returned to Sydney from Bournemouth, I would
be more effective.
   Perhaps at this stage of my saga, the Cosmos wants me to progress in my
quest.  I am getting caught up in the larger moves that are polarising the
world into 'greedy' and 'exploited'.   I am also finding that the world's
store of spare creativity is considerably smaller than I had anticipated.
   In an attempt to encourage the formation of a group of Activists, who
would create non-violent ploys for political interventions and
demonstrations, I set up the Mailing List, "creativity": well, things did
not go as I had expected; I thought we would compile a file of activities
from which other - less creative - Activists could make selections.  It was
amazing the number of ways that people can be diverted from a seemingly
obvious central theme.

   Going on from this failure (possibly to another), I have set up another
M.L. called, "nextsystem."  Just imagine that Capitalism suffers a similar
system-collapse as that which brought down Socialism in the USSR!?  What
will replace it??  Hence I ask the question: what is the appearance of the
"Next" system, which avoids the present pitfalls, and is 'sustainable'?
   Obviously, in the present, George-Soros-type exploitative world, there
is no room for ideas that are good for Humanity, like Glosa.  But we must
be waiting in the wings, ready to appear, on cue, when the curtain raises
on the next Act.
   And, if there is to be such a Next Act, perhaps we should set about
writing it, as well as well as getting the scenery ready.  People are
decrying the present system, and they are working on pieces of the puzzle
that is our future; but, somehow, a few generalists are needed to take the
overview, and see how well the suggested pieces fit together to make up a
whole.
   Isn't it amazing: there is no catch-cry behind which progressive
thinkers might muster!  "Commun-ism" has already been used, unfortunately;
"Alternativism" is not very positive; "Sustainablism" is too much of a
mouthful; maybe something general like "Equitism" or Gaianism" might follow
the implosion of Capitalism (estimated for around 2050).

   I know that too much thinking can send one mad: but, what has happened
to the Human Spirit; why are people NOT asking the NextSystem question?
We can all see that Capitalist exploitation of the Planet has turned toxic;
and any scoolboy could do the Compound Interest sum that shows a continuing
+3% annual increase in GNP, for every economy, leads, eventually, to a call
for resources beyond the Planet's capacity.  But, the locomotive is still
hurtling towards the gorge .. even though we can surmise that the 'bridge'
might not be there, when we reach the brink - and no safety loop is being
built, or even envisaged.

MEANWHILE, BACK IN THE 'REAL' WORLD ...
   I would like to try a stanza, or two, of "The Wolf."   Try me with  some
that are difficult conceptually.

I would use the first column (Glosa 1000) words as more generally known.

Also -

zoa (animal)
no-tako = lento (slow)
sieso (shake)

I take "kordiali" to mean "warm" emotionally, something like friendly.

Also "meio" means less/lessen.

Plu ami saluta,

From: William W Patterson <ailanto{at}neosplice{dot}com>
Date: Thu, 23 Mar 2000 22:50:36 -0500

In reference to recent posts by Nick Hempshall and Marcel Springer...

Marcel> anhelo - gasp, pant  (B)

Nick> I prefer "fo-spira" or "astma"

Funny you should mention that. I just ran into "anhel*" a day or so
before your post, while translating another portion of The Wolf into
Esperanto. ASTMA would work, but brings up another issue concerning
Glosa synonyms, one that I haven't dealt with yet, and I'm glad you
brought it to my attention: Why "-ing" words in the Glosa dictionaries?
When I have time I'll make another desynonymization pass, converting
"-ing" words to infinitives as appropriate, and then we can select the
preferred synonyms for those.

ANHELO is from Latin, ASTMA from Greek. Once again we've bumped into
Glosa's Greek/Latin (and sometimes others, see below) multipersonality
nature. (I still think the creators would have been better off sticking
with one or the other and applying the grammar (one of the aspects
of Glosa which appeal to me) to that one source). (It gets even more
confusing when we bump into a Glosa word which comes from one language
but is the same as a word with a completely different meaning in the
other!) In situations like this, I often look to other IALs to see
what they've selected, thus enjoying the fruits of their research
into international words. Esperanto uses "anheli", Interlingua uses
"anhelar", etc... so I'd be inclined to choose ANHELO as the preferred
synonym.

Marcel> semi - half    (G1000; Error in "Core": (?) It must be Latin
Marcel>                 "semi" or Greek "hemi". "demi" is French.)

In the sources I used to construct the dictionaries, SEMI, HEMI, and
DEMI were all found to be Glosa words for "half". Yes, French too.
Though Glosa is based primarily on Latin and Greek, words from some
other languages have snuck in. Why I chose DEMI as the preferred
synonym, I don't recall. One problem with Glosa vocabulary is that in
many cases you will find a short Glosa word with a particular meaning,
and several Glosa words that begin with this same string of characters;
in some of those words the string has the same meaning, because they
were sourced from the same language as the short word, a language in
which that word was actually a prefix. But in other words the meaning
is not the same, because they were sourced from another language, in
which that short word either didn't exist or had a different meaning. I
probably chose DEMI as the preferred synonym because it didn't clash
with the beginning of any other words. But SEMI or HEMI might be a
better choice.

Nick>   ("Glosa 1000" against "Core".
Nick>   "Core"-words are sorted alphabetically.
Nick>   Is the synonym-problem solved - or doubled ???)

I merged Glosa 6000, the several (differing!) versions of Glosa 1000,
and words from other Glosa sources on the Net, to create the Glosa
source dictionary (GES). Glosa 1000 (in its several incarnations) is
*not*, as one might reasonably expect, a subset of Glosa 6000. Thus, the
GES is the worst of all possible worlds when it comes to synonyms, but
hopefully contains the entire Glosa word store. The GES was then pruned
in various ways to create the more basic dictionaries, the most basic
of all being the Core dictionaries (GEC and EGC). There should be no
Glosa synonyms *within* the Core dictionaries, which I hoped would
someday evolve into that fabled G2000 (in the senses of year *and*
wordcount!).

Nick> I take "kordiali" to mean "warm" emotionally, something like friendly.

Me too. But see my next post, in which I conclude that KORDIALI is
a very good choice in this context.

Saluta, Marcel e plu glosa-pe!

There are some minor differences between the "The Wolf" and
"Der Wolf", so some of my re-wording can be blamed on that.

ms> Ab u monti an nu pa veni ad u vilage.
bp> Kontra-latu de monti an pa veni ad vilage.

Ah, the synonym problem. Don't worry about synonyms unless they
appear *within* the Core dictionary. Particularly with final vowels.
The various dictionaries disagree a lot on final vowels.

ms> Tem pa gene vespera.

ms> An pa atende in densi abies-silvi.

ms> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko kura peri plu fragma de plu horti,
ms> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.
bp> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko cirkumspekt peri plu horti-fragma,
bp> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.

I like that sentence! At first I wasn't sure about the use of KORDIALI.
Is Hesse referring to warmth as in heat or as in welcomeness? And
then I realized that *both* senses are appropriate here! I do prefer
CIRCUMSPEKT to KURA, because it entails the concept of wariness. As
for HORTI-FRAGMA, that's merely a personal preference. What do the
glosalistas think?

ms> Nuli-pe pa es in strata.
bp> Nuli-pe pa in strata.

As per (much) earlier discussions here, ES is not needed when PA, NU,
or FU is used. (I'm even tempted to omit PA in that sentence.) There
was much discussion about redundancy here some time ago; Once the tense
is established, is it necessary to repeat it in the same sentence? Or
for that matter, within the same paragraph? (though that argument is a
bit weaker)

ms> An pa es anxio e ko libido; an pa nikti inter plu domi.
bp> Ko anxio e ko desira an pa skope inter plu domi.

I'm not sure about that one. Comments?

ms> U-la-tem fusili.
bp> Subito stoko.

I have a feeling that the days of U-LA-TEM are numbered. It's too long,
too many syllables, for such a simple concept. Words like that tend to
get shortened with use. SUBITO is a bit different in meaning but I like
it here. I'm not sure about FUSILI vs. STOKO here. STOKO appears to
combine a couple of similar but definitely different ideas.

More to come...

ms> Ab u monti an nu pa veni ad u vilage.
bp> Kontra-latu de monti an pa veni ad vilage.
nh> Epi ma-tele latu de monti, an vide u viki.

I find "kontra" difficult to interpret.
Is it the side you can see from your current position or the side you can't?

bp> Ah, the synonym problem.

The "two words, one idea" concept behind Glosa used to strike me as
problematic too. A theoretically optimal language would not behave
in this way. But now, I wonder if this is not a benefit, in practice.
The extra effort passively to recognise two words is compensated
for by the ability to vary the word in writing/speaking, or
alternatively to use the one that comes more easily to mind.

The problem with your method of resolving synonyms is that it
will almost always result in the selection of the Latin word, where
as I would like the Greek one! Also while all the words published in
the Glosa dictionaries must be legitimate choices in writing/speaking,
I think preference should go to words appearing in a Glosa 1000 list.

ms> Tem pa gene vespera.
nh> Id es proxi nokti.

I feel it is clearer Glosa to use an empty pronoun "id" as 'subject'
for this type of sentence.

ms> An pa atende in densi abies-silvi.

ms> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko kura peri plu fragma de plu horti,
ms> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.
bp> U-la-tem an pa placidi-ki ko cirkumspekt peri plu horti-fragma,
bp> seqe ozo de plu kordiali animala-do.

"Po-co" seems better for "then".

ms> Nuli-pe pa es in strata.
bp> Nuli-pe pa in strata.

For me "es" is required, as I think Glosa sentences have to have a 'verb' 
equivalent.
The "pa" cannot fulfil this role. On the other hand, I think "pa" can be 
omitted if
the context (in this case, the whole story) makes the time reference clear.


ms> An pa es anxio e ko libido; an pa nikti inter plu domi.

Plu Karo Amika,
  The following item is sent as an attachment, because I failed to press
the right button, and wiped this letter off my screen.
  Thankfully, trusty Eudora had heard about such stupidities, and had
retained the otherwise "missing" message.  By going back into DOS, I was
able to fish the "lost" message out of the OUT.MBX file, so this explains

Excellent news Marcel,

   I must follow Marcel, both, by adding some Count-code to my Web-page, and by registering my Website with the search Engines.  Before this, there are several changes I must make to the page: 
 . change the Post Code, for the authors, to the new value, of TW9 1WD,
 . add a link to Marcel's URL,
 . add a counter to the site,
 . and add Seminar #2.

   The authors have a new Post Code, but there is no change to the other details.  You can write to them at:-
     Ronald Clark & Wendy Ashby
     GLOSA
     PO Box 18
     Richmond

     England

   Also, they have bought a new computer, having traded-in the old model.  In the future, soon, I hope, they plan to re-join the Internet.

   Marcel, what number of Neticens, who visit your website, ask for more innformation, or about joining a Glosa Users group?To how many of these visiters do you post communications in either Glosa or German? 

   Marcel, I would question you concerning the "verba-lista du ne sati", and wish to have you write more about it.  This caused difficulty for you while compiling your Website.  Please write to us about these problems so we can try to solve them with you. 

   What part of ~ ... Traduce de "Glosa Basic Reference" in Deutsch~ caused problems for you,
  simply the use of little practised language,
  the quantity of the work,
  the inconsistent contents of the list,
  or difficulties with the concepts in making a word-list dictionary?

   Or did you have problems of agreeing with ideas expressed in the "Basic Reference"?  I hope that ypou did not translate into German the statement, "Glosa has no grammar."  And I hope you found a different way of saying it, possibly that .. Glosa has no inflections, and, so, Glosa has no changes to the words for reasons of grammar.

Saluta,

Karo Bill, Nick, plu glosa-pe, 

With my short "U Lupus"-translation I was mainly interested in testing 
the "Core"-dictionary. 

Results:
- In spite of the poetic language it worked quite well. Only a few 
  words must be taken from outside (see my list). Good work! 
- "Core" goes far apart from "Glosa 1000", - whatever the ghost 
  "Glosa 1000" is!, so far, that the risk of a schism is given. 
  The mails of Nick indicate a similar opinion. 
  I think it could be fixed, when only some other synonyms would be 
  preferred.  The main effort (the lists, the program) is done. 
  Making some changes in the preferences will gain a lot. 
  I am working on a list of suggestions.  I will send it to Bill, when 
  it is ready, for further discussion. 

Saluta, 

Marcel <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>

Thank you for your comments. It is great to translate a few lines and 
then discuss it in glosalist.  It helps me learning.  It is even 
better for Glosa when we come from different native languages.  A 
discussion on that level produces not only translations but 
literature!  It does not matter, if we make only 13 lines per month.  
We will not fill a library with Glosa-literature, but it is a start of 
it!  Maybe we can continue this. 

Three small things:

  Nick wrote:
  > Also "meio" means less/lessen.
Right.  Sorry.  Mistake in my list.  But in the translation it is used 
the right way. 

  > "kordiali" ... emotion not temperature
I have been afraid of that already (cf. Latin cor, cordis n. - heart). 
Here I used the "Core"-dictionary too strictly.  A few lines earlier 
in the text Hesse told us that a barn means no place of friendlyness 
to the wolf.  It is the place of bloody orgys and massacre.  "Warm" 
means full of living beings, animals to kill and to eat.  Nick 
convinced me of "meso-termo". 

  > subito / u-la-tem / po-co 
I have to learn, that "po-co" is often better than "u-la-tem". 
"subito" (suddenly, abruptly; pl"otzlich) goes in the direction of 
"surprisingly".  Nobody in the street.  Then a shot. - The poet refused 
to mention, that that is a surprise.  Hesse used "da" (then, there), a 
short word, only one syllable.  And it sounds similar to a shot. 
Childrens playing war imitate gunshots with "da".  "U-la-tem" does not 
sound like a shot.  "subito" does not either.  Latin "tum" would be 
great, but it is not a Glosa word, or is it?

(Based on my experiences with Glosa vocabularies, I wouldn't be at all
surprised to find ANHELO and ASTMA represented equally!)

I didn't mean to imply that this was my only method, or even a primary
method. In fact, it's one of the methods of last resort! First I look
within the dictionary, comparing the synonyms with other Glosa words.
Are any of the synonyms found to be parts of other words? If yes, and
the meaning is similar... that's an argument in favor of preferential
status. If yes, but the meaning is very different... then that's an
argument against preferential status.

You are correct, comparison with other IALs would probably result in
increasing Latinization of Glosa. From the point of view of acceptance
of an international auxiliary language, that's probably a good thing.
Latin has had a bigger influence than Greek on languages worldwide, so,
on average, greater Latinization will mean greater accessibility to the
public.

Of course, that aspect of ease-of-learning (at-sight-comprehension and
true-friendliness) is a short-term consideration. In the long-term, word
source and initial recognizability are irrelevant. I kind of prefer Greek
words in Glosa too, *because* they are less familiar (more unusual) and
thus seem to work more smoothly with Glosa's grammar, at least for this
Germanic/Romance user!

I must disagree! What is the "it" that we're talking about, to what is
"it" referring? That "it" is characteristic of certain languages, but
isn't necessary or even usually explicable, except by reference to some
grammatical rule that simply states that "this is what we do". I like
Marcel's version, a nonambiguous subject/verb/object, stating that the
"time became evening(time)".

*Can* "pa" fufill this role? What *is* the role of "es"? Do Glosa sentences
have to have a verb? If so, should they? So many questions! Fair warning:
when it comes to Glosa, I'm a minimalist.

Hmm. I'm still not convinced. To a wolf, that *is* a good thing!
It's a warm place full of food, and a starving wolf in a freezing
winter couldn't ask for too much more than that! That's why I think
that *both* kinds of warmth are appropriate in this context.

I'm not sure that we should expect Glosa words to be made up of meaningful 
sub-elements. Of course they are to some extent because of etymological 
relationships in the source languages, but shouldn't the words be treated as 
unanalysable within the language itself. (Of course, this doesn't apply to 
Glosa own compound words).

Perhaps this region of the IAL spectrum is already too over-crowded.

As I say the "id" is an empty pronoun in my sentence, so it doesn't refer to 
anything. It is just filling the 'slot' in the syntactic structure. I'm not 
saying that it is a 'logical' or 'natural' requirement in a language, but as 
the 'slot' in the syntactic structure is what gives specific 'meaning' to 
the words in Glosa, perhaps it is not a bad idea to have a mandatory 
subject.

For me "(TEM) time/duration cannot become evening", though maybe it can be 
done with HORO. ~Horo pa gene vespera.~

I think they do have to have a verb to be a Glosa sentence.
Like the 'id' question, I don't think that it is a 'logical' or 'natural' 
requirement in a language, just the way Glosa is at this point in its 
evolution.

My syntax based view of ~Nuli-pe pa in strata~
No-one in-streeted. => No-one entered the street.

So the role of "es" is to stop that interpretation.

A kron,

Nick

Been a while since I spouted off on this list,
but how could I desist longer, with all this
interesting talk about vocabulary and syntax ..

Glosa has the least morphology, the most English syntax,
and the highest proportion of Greek, of all its serious
IAL/auxlang competitors. Its grammar is the easiest
to teach, simply by saying "forget school grammar,
it's like this" and showing a few examples. Still, there
must be a rational pattern to it as I think Nick explains
in a fresh and convincing manner. My own attempts to
write parser programs have led me to the following:

English and Glosa both follow a simple and flexible pattern of
syntax in which "little words" precede and "big words" follow.
This applies to noun and verb phrases, and outside of literature,
that is *all* that needs specifying. So, one expects to see
something like prepositions and determiners initiating noun phrases,
and particles/auxiliaries initiating verb phrases. Easy as pie
to parse, though the connection between phrases is "semantic"
and loose. That's just the way language is, outside of a classroom.

Glosa has some problems though, in my honest opinion, and
requires a lot more work before it can be used in the real world.

Karo plu ami,

Mi sio grafo: "per ma-grafo Glosa, tu Glosa-uti ma-boni".

De "pre u-ci" -

"Pre" is a time word, so what follows it has to be
a time or an event, this gives "u-ci" the meaning
the latter event, ie the registration as opposed
to the code addition, or following Marcel's example.
If you meant before "all the events I just mentioned",
then, "po-co" would be what I would suggest.

De "Mi nece duce Marcel bi" -

I guess you intended "seqe" here.
Marcel bi = Marcel the 2nd :-)
What do you think of "bi-mode"?
Does "nece" indicate that you are being compelled
to do so, as opposed to "volu", wishing to do so,
or "debi", felling that it would be good to do so?

Poli ami saluta,

Nick

*  Of these three, I prefer the construction, because it has the drama of ~fo-~, and does not need to extend the lexicon for this little-used concept.

   Re ~iso ... de~, I have learnt this as "as ... as"

coming across as "AS ... OF/AS/THAN" - making free use of ~de~ as the multifunction preposition.

EG ~An es iso mega de u domi.~  [He is as big as a house.]

    The authors very generously give all three in the G-->E section of Glosa 6000, so it could be a case of take-your-pick.  But:-

  . other concepts in the same lexical space could be seen as possibly causing confusion (demo [people], sema [sign], haemi [blood]),

  . one could/should be chosen for a First Dictionary - without synonyms,

  . The Latin dictionary has a number of uses of both ~semi-~ and ~demi-~,

  . the "D" of 'deuce', `due`, "deux", might favour ~demi~ = in two,

  . SEMI has come to mean "in part", and thus might infer an approximation,

  . with poetry, when dealing with an educated readership, all synonyms should be available for purposes of assonance, alternatively, for the avoidance of alliteration, or simply to follow the muse.

>>   ("Glosa 1000" against "Core".

*   As Nick points out the first column are generally better known, being from the more frequently circulated Glosa 1000 lists, but I would also add that glosa vocab has undegone a very rpid, artificially induced process of linguistic evolution.  It is with a memory of this developmental saga that I see most of the words in the first list as having been through a 'polishing' process through use, which has resulted in producing words with more or less optimal rhythm, consonant mix, and length.  Also, after the authors declared the terminal vowels to be 'deregulated' (~1989) there was some experimentation with these, and, subsequently, when the 1992 _Glosa 6000_ came out, some had been changed, but it was generally agreed that a set terminal vowel made life easier for everyone.

   ~flu~ lost an additional terminal "E", and ~mei~ was once "MEIO'.


>>lento       - adagio    (slow)

>>animali     - animala   (animal)

>>gradu       - batmo     (step)

>>leuko       - blanka    (white)

>>flu         - flux      (flow)

>>paki        - krasi     (thick) (krasi - thick, grasi - fat ?)

*  ~grosi~ [bulky] G6k


>>bali        - jakula    (cast, throw)

*  ~bali [(to) ball) flows, while ~jakula~ has the awkward "J-K" combination.


>>bate        - kolpa     (hit)

*  ~bate~ flows off the tongue, while ~kolpe has two hard sounds, "K" & "P".


>>meso-termo  - kordiali  (warm)

*  This is a case of the Word-Translation Dictionary not allowing for distinctions between objective and metaphorical usage of the one concept:

  ~meso-termo~ is a physical "middle-heat", while ~kordiale~ is a metaphorical 'heat' from the "heart".


>>soma        - korpu     (body)

>>vulne       - lesio     (wound)

>>mei         - meio      (more)

*  This could be a genuine mistake.  ~ma~ and ~mei~ are unfortunately very close in sound, but opposite in meaning: ~ma~ [more] is from ~major~ [greater]; ~mei~ [less] is from ~meio~ [lessen] ... //inflection in Glosa//?


>>nivi        - nifa      (snow)

>>odoro       - ozo       (smell)

>>no-soni     - placidi   (quiet, still)

*  Another case of objective vs metaphorical use: ~no-soni~ [no sound]; ~placidi~ [calm(ness)] seems related more to the Latin word ``placito`` [to please].  The Latin dictionary gives -

    placidus  gentle, quiet, calm, peaceful, placid, kind, mild.


>>silva       - silvi     (forest, wood)

>>promise     - sponde    (promise)

>>tremulo     - trepida   (shake, tremble)

>>viki        - vilage    (village)

>>

*   ~Mu pa habita u viki intra u silvi.~ [They lived in a village in the woods.]  Both ~viki~ and ~vilage~ are in G6k; but, remember the rules of pronunciation go against the latter, because the "G" is hard. 

  IE, ~vilage~ --> vEE-lARgAY, using the Gaskell system of phonics.  Compare this with ~viki~ --> vEEkEE.

    The G6k has   silvi wood,forest.  Does the "I" sound, and 'feel', better, or have I just conditioned myself to conform with the decision from Richmond, Surry?

    This is not actually written down in any of Glosa's promotional literature, but it is something I have intuited: both from observing the language, from the sidelines, as it unfolded; and from developing the taste for the language, by rolling it around in my mouth.

*   Agreed, the multicultural discussion is very fruitful, however, for my
purposes, an English-language version of the poem is probably necessary, to
enable me to maximise my contribution to the discussion.

*
*  Quite so, however I submit the suggestion that some of the discussion
about the poem also be conducted also in Glosa; we are among friends, here,
and any variations will be accepted in the spirit in which they are
uttered.   
   When Marcel and I exchange notes, we use Glosa exclusively, this being
for both our benefits.

*   The four-letter form was the Glosa original, but then the authors moved
to drop the "O" to replace ~meio~ with ~mei~; however, through some
mismatching in my head, this could have resulted in the two forms
persisting - with slightly different meanings, viz, mei = less, and meio =
lessen.

*   The shortage of such expletives, explosives and onomatopoea, as *DA*,
in Glosa could be a fault.
    In 'Old Glosa', ~poi~ [then] gave us the short sharp change in timing.
O.G. also featured ~posto~ [after;afterwards], but this was shortened to
~post~ and ~po~ (~po-~), the abbreviated form; ~poi~ [then] was lost in the
shuffle.
    For literary (and poetic) reasons there might be a case for reviving
the archaic form, ~poi~, in the larger Glosa lexicon.
    ~po-co~ is a different kind of "then": it represents a reflective,
philosophical change of pace, IE
   PO = after

  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run. 
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

    But when using a word like TEM at the start of a sentence, it is easy
to misread its use, into thinking of it adverbially.  Here the 'noun
marker', U, comes in very handy: there is not a milisecond of uncertainty
in the mind of the reader, we are dealing with the concept of "time".
 IE:  U tem pa gene vespera.

*   The full form is probably,  ~Nuli-pe pa es in u strata.~
    This could be minimalised to  ~Nuli-pe es in strata~
       if we know the time-frame is 'past', and we elide the ~u~.

    Alternatively, there is is also the other empty pronoun, IL [=there].
    Using the full form, we could have  ~Il pa es nuli-pe in u strata.~
    With elipsis, this could become  ~Es nuli-pe in strata.~

   I feel the idea of using the particle (pa) instead of the verb (es) to
tell us about the 'action' does not work.  The English equivalent might be
in turning "He entered the room." into "He did into the room."
   Bill, there is some difference in our approach to reductionism: While
you are a minimalist, I am an elipsist.

   Yet, for me, the ultimate judges of grammar are the eye and the ear:
after the initial creative effort of writing, does the sentence, when read
aloud, bring back to mind the original meaning that you intended;
does casually running the eye over the written words instantly 'refresh the
original idea, in your consciousness?  

Saluta,
  Robin
