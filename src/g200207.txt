Oops. I forgot the moth-eaten robe in my version. I like your word choices. The

I really like 'feno posi kade'. Much better than mine.

Yes, I should have used just 'lami' after the first mention.

Interesting choice of 'place' here. Probably not legal Glo.

Yes, 'eko loka' is better than my 'loka info'. Not sure about 'mini ra', though. 
Maybe 'eko loka info'?

Not sure about 'pulsa', as I think of that as a physical push. And another long 
sentence, which I would have chopped before 'seqe-co', at least.

Still, we chose many of the same phrases and descriptions, and your version was 
mostly very easy for me to understand. Well done!

I think there's a big distinction between Glosa's allowed grammar, and Glosa's 
documented grammar. (Or syntax--I'm not a linguist and don't know the right 
terms for these things). Anyway, Glosa currently allows a fairly wide and 
complex range of grammar elements. Personally, I think the language becomes much 
simpler if you have fewer (but stricter) rules. For those of us who speak 
English, Glosa syntax seems very natural, but for native speakers of other 
languages I'm not so sure. I would like to see a documented, and simplified, 
Glosa syntax.

I agree with #1, although I would say the main distinctiveness is the complete 
lack of inflections. I agree with #2 if we constrain ourselves to roughly G1000, 
but many folks here believe Glosa needs more than 5000 roots to be viable. I 
would add a #3 which is Glosa's extensive use of Greek roots (for better or 
worse).

Agreed. I put in a lot of hours on an alternative Glosa core word list, and I 
tried to make the English definitions far less ambiguous. It certainly has some 
errors, is definitely not official, and has not been updated for some months 
because I have turned my attention to 'Glo' (a smaller, simpler version of 
Glosa). If you haven't already looked at my Glosa word lists, you might find 
them helpful:

Strong agreement.

Subject: [glosalist] what's the G word for ... random
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Tue, 02 Jul 2002 11:08:03 -0700

Officially, "elekti ali-ra". I suppose that could become
"elektalira" in theoretical usage. The authors apparently
found that sufficient. My incomplete database of other
languages lists the following translations of RANDOM:

fre  accidentel
por  acidental
ila  aleatori
spa  aleatorio
glo  elektialira
ila  fortuite
por  fortuito
occ  hasarde

The etymology of randomness began with the French
"randir=gallop" and "randon=speedy". Then some
random American computer programmers got hold of it.

The general issue is interesting, and yet another
ill-defined problem in Glosa: What's the correct
method for finding specific vocabulary? Especially
when the desired concept is not in the tiny sample
vocabularies provided. As a programmer I prefer
clear principles and test-able, working prototypes.
Anyone can invent words or even an entire language;
lacking either agreed principles or an authoritative
guide, nobody can use it to communicate effectively.

At first I supported use of the Glosa "core" list,
approx 1800 items altogether. It is essentially
a-priori, because nobody studies Greek anymore.
But it's completely inadequate for practical use.
Then we investigated the GID, and most of us reacted
unfavorably. If we have to learn all those Latin
words then Glosa isn't much different from the other
western-european-based auxlangs. I've compared the
entire Ido vs. Glosa vocabularies, they are nearly
identical ... same size, same coverage, same roots.

As I understand it, Glosa also includes the entire
"scientific vocabulary". That would be the so-called
"combining forms" such as ORNITHO and LOGY etc.
I've counted 700 of them, there may be 1000 or so,
still not enough to form a complete or usable vocab.

Mega-Glosa also includes "international vocabulary",
defined somewhere as those words common to several
European languages. Most other IALs have similar
selection rules, such as "English, French, and either
Spanish/Portuguese or German". By that standard,
"ALEA" is already a bonafide Glosa word. But until
it appears in official word lists, nobody realizes.

My own program found these for RANDOM: ACSID, ALEAT,
and FORTUIT. But in correspondence I'd say RANDOM,
anyway. It's a new, emerging international standard.
I'll bet Esperantists use it already, they have no
aversion to breaking or ignoring rules, they just
won't change them ...

Yes, if we're adding words to Glosa, ~alea~ wouldn't be a bad one.

Otherwise, I've also just thought of ~minus skema~ ("without plan/design"). Or, 
as it would appear in Glo, ~zero skema~.

I like many of the words you found.  Here I have two official
suggestions for you:
The book "Deutsch Glosa 1000" gives for "zufällig": fortuna,
and the book "Français Glosa 1000" for "hasard": risko.
I will supplement both to GID soon.  Saluta.

Sorry, friends. Now it's very difficult time for me. I have an exam tomorrow and two another ones during 8 days. As some of you can
count, I have been having countless quantity of exams since the end of winter... These will be last ones for a half of year -
graduation of school and matriculation are too dificult, but will be finishing (at length) soon...
These days I sleep only few hours a day, so I in error sent to glosalist a letter to my friend Oleg. Sorry!

Poli ami saluta,
Alex.

P.S. I suppose I've made some tens of mistakes in English in this letter. Sorry, as I said it's too difficult time for me.

From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Sun, 07 Jul 2002 12:47:53 -0700

The best thing about Glosa is lack of affixes.
We can almost say that Glosa has no morphology.
But the presence of "generics" spoils the plan:

SUFFIX  meaning(s)       full source
======  ==========       ===========
-BO     shop             BOteka
-DO     house, building  DOmi
-FA     set, bundle      FAski
-FI     filament         FIlament
-KA     room             KAmera
-LI     stone            LIto
-LO     place            LOka
-MA     material         MAteria
-ME     device           MEkani
-MO     furniture        MObili
-PE     person           PErsona
-RA     thing            ReAli
-RU     instrument       instRUmenta

-VA     vessel           VAsa
-VE     garment          VEsti
-ZO     ring             ZOna

These are non-intuitive and anti-mnemonic,
and would be unrecognizeable in speech.
It is more efficient to use the full word
hyphenated, as with LECT(O)-ABILI etc.
In most cases the ending can be elided but
it remains available for use when needed.

Glosa should remain true to its own nature:
less fussy grammar, more practical logic.

Strong agreement.

However, I would also accept the most common of the generics being promoted to 
become full words on their own. Either way, we should eliminate this special 
case.

This works already with:
  fa, fi, lo (?), pe, ra and ru.
I think, even Charles can accept these ones with stand-alone-feature.


Problems are the Generics with two meanings:

  ma (materi and "more") - ... but -ma is very useful, I think.  I
                             would keep it, though it is not
                             satisfying.
  ka (kamera and kausa)  - -ka is quite useful, but perhaps it should
                             be eliminated from Core/Basic to avoid
                             this homonym.
  mo (mobili and "one")  - Not very useful, should be eliminated from
                             Core/Basic.
  te (textili and tende) - Not very useful, should be eliminated from
                             Core/Basic.

No, and I don't think the public could ever accept them either.
Firstly because they are artificial, unattested in any language.
Secondly because they are too short, are not stressed, and so
cannot work (be recognized) in any ordinary speech environment.
Thirdly because they are completely un-mnemonic, therefore difficult.
Other than that, no problem ... except they're ugly, too.

> Innovation can be good.

But not in a bridge language (IAL). And I trust the innovative powers
of a billion persons working over 2000 years more than that of 1 or 10
people, even trained and famous linguists, putting together something
like Esperanto or Glosa etc. So I'm in the radical naturalist camp ...

Well, yes to that. ... I imagine "Glosa-pe" pronounced with primary stress
on the first syllable and a secondary stress on the third. It seems to me
that in a language that is not used constantly in everyday life, the -PE
will not be sufficiently recognizeable, therefore cannot survive. Better
to use a real word like "-person" to compound it, instead of any affix.

> I haven't really thought about 'lo', but it seems
> like 'loka' is short enough not to need a shorter version.

Right -- and I think we can use bi-syllabic words for all root concepts,
which reduces the temptation to change INSTRUMENT to -RU; I think -METER
is a better choice than -RU. And then we aren't restricted to just 20
productive affixes, we have hundreds of potential compounders. The true
spirit of Glosa is to allow any word to serve any grammatical function,
"within reason" ... That idea is beginning to appeal to me more now.

I believe written communication is much more important for an IAL than spoken. I 
think Glosa has some bigger problems than this in the spoken department. What do 
you mean by "not stressed"?

Obviously that's a question of personal taste. I LOVE 'pe', and have gotten used 
to 'ra', as long as it _means_ "thing" and isn't merely a shortened version of 
something else. In fact, I would have to bring up a Glosa word list to even 
remember what the long form is.

I am ambivalent about 'ru'. I don't think 'fa' and 'fi' are common enough to 
warrant a two-letter word. I haven't really thought about 'lo', but it seems 
like 'loka' is short enough not to need a shorter version.

Subject: [glosalist] Suffixes As An Issue
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com

This listserv is quite helpful in clarifying for me key issues about Glosa.  
But much of the conversation raises a vital issue - who has the authority to 
change the language?

As long as Glosa is a hobby activity for a few people, it is reasonable for a 
half dozen people on a listserv to continually modify it - to decide they 
like or don't like suffixes, for example.  In the month or less I have been 
watching the mail, I would say there have been at least a dozen modifications 
suggested, some single words, some grammar rules, some definitions, and at 
least one derivative language.

If Glosa is to be more than a hobby, I would suggest the language must do two 
things:

(1) remain stable enough so that new users can learn it, and

(2) have some accepted way to develop and incorporate changes, so that those 
changes can be disseminated to the users.

The argument of course is that all languages are living things that change 
and evolve on a daily basis.  True enough.  But the languages that do so are 
large enough that certain pressures, either formal, as in national language 
academies, or informal, through general acceptance by large bodies of people 
who use them every day in a contiguous area, limit the excursions.  Even 
though use and vocabulary may change I can easily understand a passage 
written in English 20 years ago, 100 years ago, or 200 years ago.

If what I write today (and I just finished using the term mini-ra and 
grafo-pe in a paper) is to be understandable to a Glosa reader in 20 years, 
stability is not a bad thing. 

Let me suggest an extreme scenario - we on the listserv decide tomorrow that 
the clause and phrase structure makes no sense.  Instead, the verb should go 
first in every sentence, "plu" and "u" disappear (they are a real pain to 
remember to put in), and nouns should be written in all capitals, placed in 
the order of their importance to the thought, and followed by their 
modifiers.  How do we make that happen?  Do we simply post it on a new page 
on glosa.org, do I put it on my web page and it is official or unofficial, do 
we ask Wendy's permission (and if we do it, who takes responsibility for 
modifying all of the existing material stock of the Education Organization), 
or do we just start writing that way?

The impact of each of us on the language is potentially significant.  I asked 
a question about "strategy" - everyone agreed that "strategi" really means 
strategy, including Wendy, and off we go.  In reality, a careful reading of 
commonly accepted thesauruses (and I used Roget and Merriam-Webster) and an 
etymological dictionary (I used Barnhart's), convince me that "strategi" when 
originally put in the word lists, originally meant strategem or trick - an 
entirely different word, with a 400 year  different history in English, 
different origin in English than strategy, and possibly not even a completely 
shared derivation in Greek.  I am happy with "strategi" as "strategy" because 
it meets my needs, because strategy is a higher order concept than mere 
trickery, and because it is closer to what the concept of generalship (the 
Greek root) has evolved to become (but was not necessarily in Greek times).  
But it was that simple to change our language, and that is a little scary.

I admit freely that I am a novice to the language and that the list users 
have a significantly better understanding of Glosa than I do, and I hope you 
will take my comments with that caveat.  But, if anyone starts arguing in 
support of my idea about verb first ....

Apparently just Wendy now. There is no official group.
I've suggested there should be one to carry it forward.

> (1) remain stable enough so that new users can learn it,

There have been no changes since approx 1980, AFAIK.
I think changes would help, but won't happen until we ...

> (2) have some accepted way to develop and incorporate changes,

There is a concept of "Mega-Glosa" whereby vocabulary is
taken from the common "international words". That plus a few
very basic rules of grammar should be sufficient; all the
other frills are detrimental and dispensable, IMO.

> If what I write today [...] is to be understandable to

Glosa is a bridge language, an artificial auxiliary based
on existing national/natural languages, mainly consisting
of the scientific Greco-Latin "combining forms" and the
"international words" common to English/French/Spanish.
Its syntax is analytical, subject-verb-object, head-last.
Its morphology is minimal, 99% compounding, no inflections.
That's enough to work with, and set in stone.

> everyone agreed that "strategi" really means strategy,

All word meanings are negotiable and mutable, but Glosa is
not autonomic like Esperanto; even there, the vocab changed
drastically within a few years of its creator's death, in
the direction of "international" (western European) roots.
Lacking a Glosa dictionary, one could still guess most of
the words, though not their exact forms. (But no dictionary
can list literally all of the words of a living language.)

> originally meant strategem or trick - an entirely different word,

A word's meaning should not be overly-specific. Better to
use the broad meaning, and add more words for more precision.
It's easier to learn and use, and more stable in the long run.

Wendy is the only person allowed to approve changes to the official language. I 
believe that technically makes the GID slightly unofficial, since I believe it 
contains a couple words that Wendy does not approve of (such as KE).

I agree with your concern that a language must be stable to become widespread 
and usable. Actually, the reason I started work on a derivative language was 
precisely because Glosa was _too_ stable. That is, I felt there were some 
glaring problems with it, and there was no structure within the Glosa community 
to get those problems fixed.

It's a typical IAL problem, of course. Most languages remain in flux for decades 
after their creation, and eventually people get tired of the churn. A few 
languages, like Esperanto and perhaps Glosa, have become stable but perhaps "too 
early" while the language was still immature. These langauges are certainly 
usable, and have many fine qualities. But in my opinion each has a few major 
problems that could be fixed in ways that would not render all existing text 
obsolete.

It would be helpful to have a way to change the language other than convincing 
Wendy that the change is useful. Of course, any such process would run the risk 
of allowing the language to change too much.

We recently had some Glosa text posted to the list that everyone agreed was fine 
and readable. Later, we found out that it had been written something like ten 
years ago.

> I asked a question about "strategy" 
(snip)
> But it was that simple to change our language,

Many Glosa words currently lack precise English definitions. That was my 
original Glosa project--creating a core list of about 1500 Glosa words that were 
clearly defined. I didn't want to change the language--just clarify it. The 
results are on my qualitycode.com web site, under Glosa (not Glo).

I tried to stick as close to Glosa as I could, but in some cases the definitions 
just didn't make sense. In some cases the meanings were vague, while in other 
cases there were multiple unrelated meanings tied to the same word.

So most of my effort was just clarifying, but along the way, I did end up 
changing the language in a few small places. But my changes were unofficial, and 
most seem unlikely to be accepted into the official language any time soon. 
Thus, my conclusion that Glosa is really quite static.

Which is why I launched Glo as my own sandbox to play in without offending 
anyone or having to try to convince someone of my proposals. Over time, Glo will 
diverge further from Glosa, and at some point will probably be renamed to 
reflect that.

Some other IALs are fairly easy to read, more difficult to write.
"Es facil lecter e desfacil scripter, ma li oposit vell esser fatal."
I can't figure out how to properly say that in G.

That's pretty good -- I'm concerned with "easy to write"
as an adjective-infinitive combination. I suppose you
can use DE (or some other preposition) to suggest that.
Then there's "de ge-grafo" for "to be written" versus
"de du-grapho" for "to be writing", I guess ...

I agree that this seems like an unpleasant sentence. But remember that with 
English the word itself usually provides a clue that it is an adverb. Glosa 
doesn't have that (thankfully).

The question goes back to whether Glosa should make life easy for the 
writer/speaker and hard for the reader/listener, or the other way around. And 
this may be driven by whether you see Glosa's future as being written or 
spoken.

A written language should clearly favor the reader, because any given work is 
likely to be read many times by many people, but only written once. The readers 
may be in a hurry, and the writer is more likely to have more time to think 
through the structure issues.

A spoken language should be more balanced, because there are likely to be fewer 
listeners (although still more listeners than speakers), and because speakers 
need to be able to throw sentences together in "real time". 

I dislike complex structures like Lojban because I think they would be too 
difficult to speak AND to understand when spoken. I could be wrong.

I believe that Glosa's number one priority should be to be really, really easy 
to read. Next, I would want it to be easy to speak and listen. Finally, it 
should be reasonable to write.

Given those priorities, rules that limit the structure pretty severely make a 
lot of sense. It helps readers and listeners a great deal. It also helps 
speakers, because simple rules can be applied quickly. Speakers also have the 
advantages of non-verbal communication to help them get their message across.

I agree with this. I haven't figured out rules for it yet, but it seems like a

Glosa has to make sense to non-English speakers.

I also find myself drawn to this structure, but find the comma to be inadequate. 
I'm still working on coming up with something better.

> Shouldn't this be: "An pa celero kurso, tem..."?

Using outmoded terms like "adverb" causes this confusion.
There are several very different things called adverbs.
This one seems to be an "adverb of manner". Whatever ...

Making the verb phrase too long looks unnatural.
Maybe "in a fast manner" or "with speed" would best
translate it, because the bare word doesn't really fit
anywhere or modify anything directly.

In both English and Vulgar Latin, they simply compounded
an adjective with "-lich" (body) or "-mente" (mind) and
let its position float. So then it'd be "kurso celero-menta"
or such, but then how to know where the direct object begins?

Glosa lacks a clear marker for transitivity, as does English.
Tok Pisin (Pidgin) has Glosa-like syntax, and uses "em" to
introduce a direct object. They also mark the start of the
verb phrase with "i", so syntax is greatly felicitated:

1. Famina kavalo i kurso kon celero. (Hungry horse runs fast.)
2. Celero kavalo i manduka em celeri. (Fast horse eats celery.)
3. Famina i kavalo a gastro. (Hunger gallops into the stomach.)

Interesting post. I take it as a suggestion that perhaps, possibly, Glosa (or 
Glo, anyway) could abandon direct verb modifiers altogether. That is, you 
could/would not put any modifiers immediately before the verb--all verb 
modifiers would be connected with a preposition.

Moving to the other topic, I don't think Glosa really needs 'em' to indicate 
direct objects, as long as nouns are marked with u/plu or some other unambiguous 
flag. A noun phrase that comes after a verb without being introduced by a 
preposition _is_ the direct object. I'll think more about it though--perhaps 
using 'em' would help clarity or improve overall consistency.

Kevin

Not exactly -- all direct verb modifiers (usually called "auxiliaries")
fit nicely before the verb, but the more indirect ones (which in English
commonly take the -LY suffix) should be rendered with a preposition.

That's quite possible, as long as those pesky "indirect adverbs" (-LY words)
are always prepositioned -- otherwise they float around until they usurp
the D.O.'s position. As in the original CELERI example, where the preceding
direct-adverb seems stylistically too long for my taste, though not incorrect.

The general pattern in Glosa is for short modifiers to directly precede,
and long modifiers to follow the modifyee indirectly (i.e. after a
preposition), as in simple English syntax: "big cat" vs. "cat of huge size",
"he soon finished eating" vs. "he finished eating in a short time".
Thinking in this general pattern, we can avoid getting entangled by
odious and confusing grammatical terms like "adverb of manner", etc.

The cure for that is to stop using Microsoft Outlook.
Getting a Mac or Linux also prevents future recurrence.

Subject: [glosalist] More semi-Glosa experiments
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 21 Jul 2002 13:09:40 -0600

As most of you know, I have been designing a new language named Glo, which 
started as a 500 root subset of Glosa. The name of the language will be changing 
soon, to reflect the fact that it is no longer a pure subset of Glosa.

I offer my experiments here, in the hope that one or more might actually be 
useful in Glosa itself at some point. Of course, I don't expect (or want) Glosa 
to adopt any of them quickly (if at all). 

My language continues to be mostly compatible with Glosa. Out of the 455 roots, 
only 22 are not Glosa words, and most of those are Romance roots that would be 
recognizable by any Glosa-pe.

First, I have added CA as a verb phrase marker. VP must always start with CA, 
even if they are in the past or future. So you might say 'mi ca salta' or 'mi ca 
futuri salta'. At the moment, I have futuri/pasada instead of fu/pa, so 
non-Glosa-pe can recognize the intent. That may or may not change.

The subject always precedes the verb (precedes the CA), so it no longer needs to 
be marked as a noun. 'animali ca salta' is fine. You can omit the subject by 
starting the sentence with CA: 'ca nivi'.

I have introduced DA to mark a direct object. We already have prepositions to 
mark when an indirect object starts, so DA is kind of like a preposition just 
for direct objects. 'mi ca amo da animali'. 'mi ca pasada vendo da vegeta a tu' 
or, with the same meaning 'mi ca pasada vendo a tu da vegeta'.

Now, UNO is one/a/any, and U/UN is no longer needed as a noun phrase marker. PLU 
remains as plural/some, and also is no longer a noun phrase marker. While 
thinking about PLU, I realized that PLU TU would work fine for plural you, so I 
took VI out of the language.

Next, I expanded the role of CO. You can now say CO PERSONA to refer to the 
just-said-person, which would be "he/she/they/them". So I was able to remove MU 
from the language. CO KOSA is the just-said-thing, or "it", so ID could be 
removed from the language as well. 

Next, I got rid of U-CI/U-LA/PLU-CI/PLU-LA which I have always disliked. How? 
Well, I borrowed tricks from Tunu and Lingua Franca Nova, and probably others. 
First, I reversed the concept: instead of the-here for this, I have this-place 
for here.

So I need a word for "this", and I chose LE. LE actually means "the, this, 
that", depending on where you are pointing when you say it. Therefore, LE LOKA 
is here or there, depending on where you are pointing.

In writing, you more often really want to use a variant of CO, to refer to 
something you had referred to in the past. Or you want your writing to refer to 
itself, which can be handled like: 'se libra ca es boni'. (I haven't worked out 
the exact use of SE yet, but I think the general concept is solid).

All of this ended up removing several words, (including many of my least 
favorite Glosa words), while simplifying some rules and reducing the chance for 
ambiguity. I had to add only three words (CA, DA, LE). I think it is an 
improvement.

I have updated my website (including my BNF grammar rules) to reflect most of 
these changes:

Experimentation is good, especially since there is so little use of
Glosa-as-it-is-today. The basic concepts of Glosa, analytic syntax
and international vocabulary, are certainly a good foundation.
Clearly some further evolution is necessary. Many of the ideas
you suggest seem worth a trial ...

That seems especially good; the highest frequency words should
be mnemonic and euphonic, both.

I like the LE, but there's also LA for "that, there". All languages
make "deictic" distinctions like this/that, here/there, etc.
You could use both LE and LA in the same sentence as in the English
use of "the former" and "the latter", or what linguists call
the proximate/obviative. Very useful.

The more natural way is to use "this/that". I don't trust a-priori
inventions such as Glosa's -CO, they never work out in the real world.

> P.S. Here are my latest root changes to make Glo more Romance and less Greek:

Originally, Interglossa was largely Greek because it was thought the
international scientific vocabulary would rule the futuristic day.
But scientists now have abandoned Greek for coining new terms, and
the horrible medical/legal terminology seems to be going permanently
out of fashion. Glosa evolved toward Latin, with the remaining Greek
words so disfigured in orthography as to become unrecognizeable and,
worse, conflict with well-known latinate words. A pure-Greek or
Koine version of Glosa would be very interesting, but impractical.
So I vote to exile them all and retain only modern latinate words.
And then, reconsider the case of K vs. C, as the Roman Senate did.

That's exactly what Glosa desperately needs, more true Romance.
The auxlang that attracts the most teenyboppers will surely win.

Glosa uses K in a pseudo-Greek attempt at pseudo-phoneticism.
This single step renders all the familiar words of civilization
that happen to include a C (approx 33%) unrecognizeable.
The great linguist (interlinguist) Otto Jesperson, who first
devised the IPA (international phonetic alphabet) tried this
approach in his auxlang Novial, circa 1927, but by 1930 he
saw the error of his ways and reformed it by un-K-ing it.
I feel that Glosa should do likewise rather than cleaving
to false grecianity. In the old days, as today, governments
high-handedly tampered with technological standards such as
orthography and terminology (gobbledegook). Latin was never
as stable as we might think, having diverse dialects (like
British vs. American vs. Texan today) and constantly mutating
its alphabet (C G K Q V J ...) I tried to find a nice summary
URL but couldn't (using google.com) but you can well imagine.

They should have used "c" as [k] in that i think, and used "k" for [C] 
(c-cedilla) or [c] or maybe [q].

Did he have "hard" always "c" (ie: c=k), which is teh Roman, and the 
logical way, or hard and soft?

Why did they have 3 [k] sounds in the Romabet? Why didn't they just write 
"c" for them all - for example "quid" = "cuid"? "V" and "J" were later 
additions though - the Romans didn't have 'em.

It's a popular fallacy to believe that pronunciation
(of soft C, for instance) is similar in most places.
Pronunciation varies more and faster than spelling:
"C" is /k/, /ts/, /S/, /tS/, /s/, /z/, /C/, or ...
and 99% of all auxlang usage is written, not spoken.
As it is, even English speakers who share a common
written language can barely follow movie dialog
from the far ends of the old British Empire.

If you allow either hard or soft, you can always use hard
if you like, as is often suggested in Latin courses. But,
if you use 2 different letters then you must dissimilate
the pronunciations, and then the same old problem recurs.
Logic must be deep, not superficial; etymology is an abyss.
Jesperson, champion phoneticist, eventually capitulated.

The solution is to spell C/K/Q with C, allow pronunciation
to float anywhere between hard and soft. In other words,
accept natural commonly observed variations as allophones
of the mighty C phoneme. It will happen anyway, nobody can
stop it; even in Esperanto people do it, violating their
own rules as usual. Read some Glosa aloud, as soon as
your guard falls, they're baaaack!

> Why did they have 3 [k] sounds in the Romabet?

Random historical accidents dented their logical jalopy.
It isn't known whether they stole it from local Greeks
or Etruscans, with different alefbethic "colors" already
(maybe because the Etruscans emigrated relatively early),
probably both. Romans adapted the Grecobet to their own
mongrel Italic, which lacked many of the Greccish sounds
and changed others (like Z to R -- was it their diet?).
Phonetic debris really accumulates across the millenia.

But we need to simplify if we want a nice easy bridge
language for adults to pick up in a week. Pronunciation
must be EXTREMELY EASY, and Glosa is DIFFICULT. So:

H ->     ...  already is silent for most people
J -> GI  ...  or maybe J -> I
K -> CU  ...  better than K -> C
Q -> C   ...  Spanish does this
W -> V   ...  better than W -> U
X -> S   ...  or maybe X -> C
Y -> I   ...  many langs do this
Z -> S   ...  a rose is a roze

Look, if we're starting with an inventid language, atleat make it one 
letter per sound! "ku" would be "ku", "kv" would be "kv", that's that! 
People are capable of saying both - it's not one sound, but two!

Glosa is not a purely invented language. It takes vocabulary from
existing languages, and is intended to enable a billion people
from cultures speaking those languages to inter-communicate.
For an apriori language, better try Loglan or Klingon. Even there,
you never get uniform pronunciation from adults who learn it.
Only children can learn to pronounce a language perfectly, and
they always mutate (creolize) language in unpredictable ways.
The only safe option is a neutral fixated spelling with locally
varying pronunciation, as with Medieval Latin for 1000 years.

English spelling of its Greco-Latinate vocabulary is pretty good,
but pronunciation sucks in diverse splendor. French is similar
though with less diversity. Spanish is entirely illogical in
the way you complained of, since it uses many ways to spell and
pronounce the same root/stem in its derivative series. Add also
Italian and Portuguese to the mix; one well-known Interlingua
has managed to find the common central tendency and produced
a dictionary which is online. I've done that algorithmically
from public bilingual word-lists, and simplified the spelling
by eliminating redundant letters. That's all anybody can do.

You're right about that. Experiments seem to show that to retain
mnemonic value, root/stems need to be more like FELIN than FELE.
Still bisyllabic, as most Glosa words are, but with the extra
consonant as an etymological clue. Then we must either terminate
each word with a schwa sound (workable) or add a part-of-speech
or cosmetic vowel (probably unworkable).

But numbers are indexes. Each language can be indexed and then
machine translation is easy as pi to whatever precision desired.
That's basically the UNL idea ...

>> Latin is not simple, and is dead.

> I meant a simpliFIED latin - and because it's dead, it's neutral.

No good, you must coin new words, BEISBOL LAZER KIMCHI ...
Revise the suffixes and words would become twice as long,
completely un-mnemonic, ridiculous-at-1st-sight. Esperanto
attempted to recode Latin (into Slavic) and doesn't work.

>> Whereas half the world today

> That's not Glosa though!

Find a root that is in Glosa but not in E/F/P/S. It's tough to do.
The semantics of the roots are also imported to G. The syntax is
essentially Romanic except adj-noun backward as in Germanic.
Glosa is essentially Ido minus affixes (an old joke).

> -o as noun, -a as adjective is very easy methinks.

Ah, the vowel game again. Originally there was light p-o-s marking
in Glosa, but it was dropped around 1970. Why not use Ido for that?
With a little cleansing of roots, and more naturalistic suffixes,
Ido might become very practical -- and then be renamed Occidental.
Glosa hates verbs, adjectives, and all other archaic grammatical
terminology (and doesn't offer anything to replace it).

Latino sine Flexione
/ Interlingua de Peano

Idea de literatura mundiale, que Herder et Goethe habe intellecto praecipue
ex puncto de visu de arte, habe hodie acquisito, ex puncto de visu de
scientia, sensu etiam majore. Nam, de commune possesiones de genere humano,
hihil es tam generale et internationale quam scientia. Sed omne
communicatione et propagatione de scientia ute auxilio de lingua, et ita
internationalitate de scientia postula in modo irresistibile
internationalitate de lingua. Si nos considera, que hodie plure opere
scientifico, in particulare tractatus, es translato in duodecim vel plus
lingua extero, tunc nos cognosce quale immane mole de labore pote es
praeservato, si libros, ubicumque in terra, pote es aequaliter intellecto in
generale, sicut per exemplo notas musicale aut tabulas de logarithmos.

Interlingua / IALA

Le idea de literatura mundial que Herder e Goethe concipeva essentialmente
ex li puncto de vista del arte, ha nunc ganate ancora multo plus grande
importantia ex li puncto de vista del scientia. Nam de omne commun
possessiones del humanitate necun es tam vermente general e international
quam le scientia. Sed omne communication e propagation del scientia usa le
medio del lingua. Tunc le internationalitate del scientia irresistibilemente
postula le internationalitate del lingua. Si nos considera, que hodie plure
obras scientific, specialmente libros de insenio, se trova traducite in
dece-duo o plus linguas estranietunc nos comprende qual immense quantitate
de labor on economisarea, si on poterea tanto generalmente comprender libros
ubicumque apud le globo como assi notas musical o tabulas de logarithmos.

Occidental / Interlingue

immens quantita' de labor on vell economisar, si on vell posser comprender

Esperanto

La ideo pri mondliteraturo, kiun Herder kaj Goethe konceptis chefe el la
vidpunkto de la arto, akiris nun el la vidpunkto de la scienco multe pli
gravan signifon. Char el la komunaj posedajhoj de la homaro, neniu estas
tiel vere ghererala kaj internacia kiel la scienco. Sed chiu komunikado kaj
disvastigado de la scienco uzas la helpilon de la lingvo kaj tial la
internacieco de la scienco nerezisteble postulas la internaciecon de la
lingvo. Se ni konsideras, ke nuntempe kelkaj sciencaj verkoj, precipe
lernolibroj, estas tradukitaj en dek du au pli da fremdaj lingvoj, tiam ni
komprenas, kiom granda kvanto da laboro povus esti shparata, se libroj chie
en la mondo povus esti tiel ghenerale komprenataj kiel ekzemple la
muziknotoj au logaritmaj tabeloj.

Ido

La ideo pri mondo-litaraturo, quan Herder e Goethe konceptabis esence del
vidpunto dil arto, ganis nun del vidpunto dil cienco mem plu granda importo.
Nam del kozi, quin la homaro posedas komune, nula es tam vere universala ed
internaciona kam la cienco. Or, omna komunikado e propagado dil cienco uzas
la moyeno dil linguo, do la interacioneso dil cienco postulas nerezisteble
la internacioneso dil linguo. Se ni konsideras, ke cadie sat multa ciencala
verki, specale lernolibri, tradukesas aden dekedu o plu multa stranjera
lingui, ni komprenas, qua enorma quanto de laboro povus sparesar, se libri
omnaloke sur la terglobo povus komprenesar tam generale, kam exemple muzikal
noti o logaritmala tabeli.

Novial

Li idee pri mondo-literature, kel Herder e Goethe koncepted esentialim fro

vidpunctu del scientie. Den ek li coses kel li homaro posese comunim, nuli
is tam verim general e international kam li scientie. Or omni comunico e
meditatione del scientie usa li moyene del lingue, dunke li internationaleso
del scientie demanda nonresistablim li internationaleso del lingue. Si nus
considera ke disdi pluri sciential verkes, particularim lernolibres, es
traductet en dekdu e plu multi lingues, tand nus comprenda qui imensi
quanteso de laboro povud bli sparat, si libres povud omnilok sur li globe
bli comprendat tam generalim kam exemplim musical notes o tabeles de
logaritmes.

Apologies for posting in English.  Just a quick question:
I am interested in how Glosa as currently defined differs from Hogbens 
original Interglossa.  Would anyone be able to give a quick summary of the 
main differences between the two languages?

Thanks.
