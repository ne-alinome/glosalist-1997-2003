in taking the overview of all knowlege, we, in Glosa, ranged our eyes over
the picture of a man, saw him to be shod, and declared that he had on PLU
PEDI-VE.

        For wet weather, we no doubt have PLU PLUVI-SOKO or PLUVI-PEDI-VE;
and for really muddy places, we would put on our PLU PLUVI-BOTA, probably
rubber Wellington boots.

    Why the specification of plurality in the use of a general term?  I
consider it unnecessary.  This seems to me to be merely native speech
habits creeping in, lending further credence that Glosa is nothing more
than recoded English.  In that case, why not junk Glosa and just have
everybody learn English?

    I definitely agree here.  I think there should be avoidance of
multiplication of vocabulary beyond what is necessary.  That is why 
I do not necessarily advocate use of "Glosa 6000" but suggested
consideration of a few more generics to allow further word-building
without undue expansion of the root word stock.

    If Majordomo is ready to go, I can just email you the list of the
addresses current members of the discussion group, on the presumption
that they would want to continue.  How you would get them into
Majordomo I do not know, as I am unfamiliar with it.  Then you would
have to make an announcement as to change of address people should make
for new postings.  In the meantime, I could probably forward any
resudual postings coming to the old address to the new group.  Also, it
would only take me a few minutes to change the text on the GlLosa web
pages.

"Mi kanta." as a *complete* sentence would have to mean "I sing.",
since the alternative would not be a complete sentence.

As *part* of a sentence, the meaning would depend on the rest of the
sentence. In a well-formed Glosa sentence I'd expect all the pieces
to support each other in such a way that no ambiguity would exist.
Context. Many Glosa words can serve in more than one part-of-speech
role, with the part-of-speech in a particular sentence being determined
by the word's position in that sentence. If "mi kanta" is taken as a
sentence fragment, we don't know the position that it had in the original
sentence, so we can't say one way or the other what part of speech it was.

I wonder if setting an increased word count goal (Glosa 6000) is the best
guide for improving "expressiveness", since it might be at the expense of
requiring increased memorization. For any new proposed word, do you make a
point of identifying the closest existing compound word that approximates
the same meaning to help you judge whether creation of a brand new word is
justified?

Compound words can be tricky. I recall one language, or maybe just a
hypothetical example, which referred to some small fruit, *not* a grape,
as a "purple-berry"; a grape was a "wine-berry". Wine-berry would be
recognizable by a member of a culture that does wine, but not by a person
who doesn't know wine; either way, a purple-berry could easily be taken
for grape. One must consider the culture, or in Glosa's case, many cultures,
and form words appropriately. I think a good approach would be to expand
the vocabulary for the sake of precision, but to allow users to form
compounds (at their own risk, perhaps) as needed if they don't know the
Glosa word, or if Glosa doesn't have an appropriate word. And for Glosa
to include the compounds when recognizability is highly probable.

Yep, I'd say that a PEDI-VE would be comparable to the English SHOE - the
primary footwear in a culture. Anything alse to be worn on the foot would
need further qualification; and the other words can be synonyms, or
literary.

I think that the lexicon will certainly change with time and become less
classical; but the Classic Glosa will always be sitting there in the
background!

Now... a request! I have very few Glosa oneliners in my random .signature
generator - a lot of English, much Esperanto, some Ido and Interlingua,
and a sprinking of other languages. But little Glosa as yet. That's why
the .sig below is probably going to be in English or Esperanto. The request
is this: please submit Glosa translations of your favorite oneliners to
the list so that I can enhance my .sigfile! TIA!

The conlang AllNoun was designed to have only one part of speech, the noun.
A strange but interesting idea. But I couldn't find much about it at that
time. In some ways it appeared to be similar to Glosa, but in addition it
uses particles to convey verbal ideas. I also tend to think that the
Universe requires at least verbs and nouns, actions and things to do the
acting and be acted upon, and that this pair may also be sufficient. But if
I try real hard I can almost see these as One and the Same.

Well done! - I see that you fixed this in the printable Glosa-English
dictionary! But in the original files, if you look up FINGER you find
DIGITA, and if you look up TOE, you also find DIGITA, and neither mentions
the other. Thus we seem to have a homonym, but we don't really - it's just
that DIGITA is more inclusive than the dictionary indicates if you only
happen to look up one of the terms.

*       Bene-venu Andy,
Glosa is planned - for better or worse - to be a language in which the words
are concept-centres.  It could thus be a "metalanguage" or one of the latest
trends in the evolution of language.  

        English:- ................... Glosa:-
        I, me, my, mine ............. mi
        sing, sings, song, singing .. kanta
        You guessed it: MI KANTA is both "I sing" and "my singing"; it is also 
"my song," and if you push it, "me sing[?]".

        Some languages have complicated inflection systems to indicate their
grammar: of the national languages English has a minimal inflectional system;
I am jumped upon when I say that Chinese lacks inflections altogether (but
it still seems to be true, anyway); and Glosa has words that do not change
for reasons of grammar.

        In Glosa, as in 50% of English, the grammar is all in the syntax!
 "Dog bites man." = U KANIS MORDA UN ANDRA. 
 "Man bites dog." = UN ANDRA MORDA U KANIS.

        Back to the song:-
 "I sing when I am happy."  MI KANTA KRON MI HABE HEDO. [.. have happiness.]
 "The bird replied to my singing."  UN AVI PA RESPONDE A MI KANTA.
 "My singing is too loud."  MI KANTA HABE TRO SONO [ .. has too much sound.]
 "When I sing, the whole world listens."  KRON MI KANTA, U HOLO MUNDA AKUSTI.
 "Will I sing now?"  QE, MI NU KANTA?
 "What: me sing?"  QOD: MI KANTA?
 "My song was from the heart"  MI KANTA PA VENI EX U KADIA. [ .. did come .. ]
 "The singing you heard was mine." U KANTA; TU PA AUDI PA ES MI.[did be mine.]
  ............................................................. [.. was me.]

 "I sing my song."  !!!!!!!!!  _not_  MI KANTA MI KANTA.
  ........................... _more_  MI VOCA MI KANTA.  [ .. voiced .. ]
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On the Glosa discussion group, we are using the kindness of Paul Bartlett's 
Mail Forwarder.  By now, Paul will have added your e-address to his
Forwarder list, and anything you send to     glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
will be forwarded to all of us on that list.

 My ISP has installed Majordomo, and soon we will get the Glosalist back
with my ISP, thanking Paul for giving us a temporary home.  The Forwarder
works perfectly, but it was only a stop-gap while I was negotiating with my
provider.  Paul and I will discuss the best way to swap the list back to me
so it will look like a normal Mailing List.

        The mechanics will be:-  
        To: majordomo{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

        [message] subscribe glosalist

After that messages to the Glosalist Mailing List will be addressed:-
        To: glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Nousen, I would ask for your land address so that I can send you a
Glosa  "Experimental Dictionaries" disk in the mail; this is in ASCII format
for IBM.  The idea is that the authors have asked me not to release the full
"Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Internet.  So I am sending out the scanned
dictionary on disk to Glosa-pe.  Anyone else on the Forwarder wishing to
recieve the disk can send me a request for it.  The lists are sorted
alphabetically, and there is  Eng -> Gl  and  Gl -> Eng, as well as a
printable three-column dictionary from Glosa to English.

        I look forward to getting more questions like Andy's.

What about neologisms?  To burden or not burden that is the question?  The
beauty of Glosa is in its simplicity and the powerful way it uses its source
lexicon (Greco-Latin terminologies).  New coinages ought to conform to
existing lexical stock, however the user (writer and speaker) should be
allowed to introduce new words and let linguistic evolution take its course.
Words not wanted will not take hold, because the user(s) will not employ them.

I apologize if I went too far (this is only my opinion!).  Feel free to write

*       I agree with your logic, and so does Paul Bartlett, who points out
that two words for the one thing makes for confusion and non-understanding.
so, the 
GE.TXT file will not contain both AQA and HIDRO for water, and a decision in
favour of one is needed.  This does not need to be too difficult, because,
once a person learns the basic vocabulary, they can go on to absorb the
"Literary" dictionary by adding the synonyms, later (EGL.TXT).  There
probably should also be a corresponding  GEL.TXT  file giving Glosa first,
with the various Glosa synonyms.

        As Andy Nousen says, a dictionary of 6000 is daunting as a learner's
dictionary.  I feel that the 1600 word-list was too short; somehow we should
derive a suitable list for a teaching dictionary - one that has enough words
for writer comfort, and sufficient to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive
undersatnding of the language, and how it works.

        Perhaps when you have completed the first trimming of synonyms,
Bill, we should all look at the  GE.TXT  results and suggest additions ad
subtractions to make the dictionary of immediate value to a learner, without
overloading him or her with vocabulary.

Saluta,
Robin

The conlang AllNoun was designed to have only one part of speech, the noun.
A strange but interesting idea. But I couldn't find much about it at that
time. In some ways it appeared to be similar to Glosa, but in addition it
uses particles to convey verbal ideas. I also tend to think that the
Universe requires at least verbs and nouns, actions and things to do the
acting and be acted upon, and that this pair may also be sufficient. But if
I try real hard I can almost see these as One and the Same.

Well done! - I see that you fixed this in the printable Glosa-English
dictionary! But in the original files, if you look up FINGER you find
DIGITA, and if you look up TOE, you also find DIGITA, and neither mentions
the other. Thus we seem to have a homonym, but we don't really - it's just
that DIGITA is more inclusive than the dictionary indicates if you only
happen to look up one of the terms.

*       In the case of "go", it is ''goingness'': the essence of ''going'';
the moving out and away from something.

        At the most abstract level of thought, where we suspend disbelief,
the 'essence of going' is a real thing .. Bill has captured it as " ... One
and the Same."  But, at the non-poetic, more concrete level of language use,
most people have labels tagged as describing either things or actions.  And
this is, I believe, largely non-intellectual, with people opening their
mouths and the words popping out - there being little, or no, reflection
involved in the process.     
        The stock of substantives is kept in some minds as loose and
undifferentiated concepts, while in others, it is divided into two groups as
different and distinct as pitch and rhythm, in music.  I can say that, and
be criticised for it, but I would like to know what is the current knowlege
on the various ways that the lexicon is stored in our brains.  I suspect
that the experts do not know, and that my opinion, based on observation and
reflection, is as good as the next person's.

        Back to Glosa.  This undifferentiedness of the Glosa lexicon is
either a strength or a weakness of the language.  For the poet and the
thinker, it would be a strength allowing conceptualisation of hitherto
unexpressed ideas; for the technically-minded however it gives the language
less depth and solidity than they would like.  The shades of meaning in most
languages are achieved with the use of inflection .. both of nouns and
verbs, and these inflections are missing in Glosa.  .... However, I keep
coming back to the thought that there is a trend towards simplification over
time, and that both Chinese and English are low on inflections: Chinese
because of its long history, and English because of the many cultural
pressures it has been subjected to.  This crude "survival of the fittest"
usages argument is unacceptable to some, but seems to be in tune with the
orgnaic, evolutionary develeopment of language, over time.

        While English and Chinese are hard to learn for many, because they
both appear to lack easily learnable rules, these languages are both strong
on syntax.  It is syntax which is the basis of Glosa's grammatical system:
this is the opposite to a language like latin, where word order is not
important, and the burden of conveying the meaning rests on a complex
inflectional system.

        At the same time this explains the reason for Glosa's appearing to
be like English, and the difficulty in understanding its grammar.  While
there are some conventions like the "Qe, ... " to start a question and the
use of particles to achieve plurality, Glosa tends to follow the syntactic
patterns that have proved preferable, over time, in the languages that rely
largely on syntax for their semantics: Chinese and English.  And these rule
are for the most part unstated, and hard-wired into our brains.

        Am I saying that if we teach people the rules of syntax, then they
will be able to speak and write Glosa faily well.  I guess so. 

        These rules can be written down, though they usually are not, and
this could be one thing holding back the disemination of Glosa.  Quite apart
from syntax, which could almost be a mechanical set of instructions - like a
computer program - there is also the essence of the words, and this also is
usually not taught, other than in senior literature classes at school or at
university.  So, when I first met Glosa, I had to un-learn "is" and discover
that, in Glosa, there were about four concept-words that more accurately
conveyed what, in English, is conveyed using "is."

IS:     essence, true nature .................. ES
        property of ........................... HABE
        becomes, gets ......................... GENE
        measures, equals ...................... EQA

 EG 'An es Robin.'  'U meteo habe frigi.'  'Id gene termo.'  'Fe toto eqa tri.' 

     He is Robin.   The weather is cold.    It is hot.       Her score is three.

Saluta,

Good idea! The synonym-trimming hasn't been much trouble really. It's
the homonym-resolution that's a killer! But it's fun too. But it's
time-consuming. But it's fun anyway.

    How many people around the world are actually using Glosa to any
extent at all I have no idea.  However, I think that members of this
discussion group need to remember that they are a tiny minority and
that ideas they come up with will probably remain largely unknown to
the rest of the world, especially in light of the fact that the Glosa
Education Organization does not participate at present.

    Also, a lot of the discussion seems to be quite rarified.  My
understanding was that Glosa was intended to facilitate general
communication among people of dissimilar native languages much like 
a pidgeon, in which lofty discussions of meta-language considerations
have little place.

I prefer the flavour more of the "serendipitous," and there could really be
a word, somewhere for 'serendipitous synergy.'  Then, when we discover it,
we can go on to even greater heights of mutual creative stimulation.

        This actually was the way that the Glosa Tense Table emerged:
someone put forward a suggested tense list - the first one could even have
come from me; I was working with a chap who was a Latin-nut, at the time -
and bit by bit, the Table went round the traps, and was added to and
ammended on its journey.  No-one could say they did it, but the final result
was the fastest case of forced evolution I have ever seen.

*       Agreed, but the original Glosa lists were far too much influenced by
the culture that created the Classical lexicons.  I have a contemporary
Greek/English dictionary and a Latin/English dictionary: the contrast is
tangible.  Modern culture is reflected in the Greek dictionary; while in the
Latin one, the cultural references all appear to have been taken from
Plato's speeches.  The roots, largely because they were 'neutral,' offered
modern Science the obvious medium for international discussion; and this
will carry on into the future, with the "dead language" neutrality
continuing to offer the best way of maintaining the balance of power, or
cultural balance, between participants in the world scene.  My favourite
neologism has to be "television," marrying the Greek and Roman, overcoming
the barrier that had remained between these two cultures two millenia after
they had ceased to exist.

MY LIFE: The saga continues.  I failed to qualify in the system of train
safe-working called "Block Telegraph," and this means I am not qualified to
work trains through the sections that operate under this system! I did pass
"Road Knowlege," however: this was a viva voce exam, and we had an easy
tester, thank goodness.  Imagine travelling over four train lines in four
days, stopping periodically to look at the track layouts, and learning how
trains are worked through them.  Of course, the shapes of the platforms,
existence of tunnels, systems of safeworking and the division of these into
sections, is included.
        Needless to say, I started learning the station names a month ago,
to be sure I knew them .. and I still temporarily froze in to-day's exam.
Be assured the educational stone age is alive and well in the NSW railway
system.  While the Driver's Inspectors conducting the test are practical
men, who realise the impossibility of the task, and test sympathetically,
the other test, on Block Telegraph has legal connotations, and is sponsored
by the Department of Transport.  The pass mark is 80%, and there were 137
multiple choice questions: I scored 77% and will have one more chance at it,
on the railway's time.
        There are two more test: one a shorter one on a different system of
safeworking, "Single Line Track Circuit"; and the last is on the working of
Inter-Urban trains.  All this is a bit of a strain at 61, but I do wish to
make the extra money!

Subject: Change of Glosa Discussion Group Mechanism
To: glosa
Date: Wed, 31 Dec 97 17:5

    The current mechanism for the Glosa Discussion Group always was 
a temporary expedient.  Now that Robin Gaskell has access to a real
mailing list service, the group will be shifting there, and the old
mechanism will be shutting down.  However, you will NOT be
automatically transferred.  If you want to continue with Glosa, you
will need to subscribe to the new service.  To do so, send an email 
to the address:

Majordomo{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

with the single-line message:
