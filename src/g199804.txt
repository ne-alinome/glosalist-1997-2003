*	Well, Bob Petry raised this and other questions, and these were commented
on by John Schilke and Paul Bartlett.

	I wish to give my understanding of the situation; but, various aspects of
the Ig/Glo conundrum were mentioned.  I would comment on:-
	. the spirit of Interglossa,
	. The verb systems of Interglossa and Glosa, and 
	. the Clark-Ashby continuation
in separate posts. 

The Clark-Ashby Continuation:
	Bob's questions continue ...

*	According to Ron Clark, Hogben was disappointed that his language
proposal had not been taken up popularly after the war.  But, again
according to Clark, Hogben recognised that his Pelican publication was more
of a start, than a complete treatment of the situation, and welcomed
Clark's interest in the language, and authorised his 'continuation' of the
work.

	When I met Clark and Ashby in 1977, they had reduced the Hogben "Sentence
Landscape" (p37 _Interglossa_) of a three-part Part-of-Speech
system:-
	(a) All verboids end in  -e.
	(b) Substantives end in  -a or -i.  Exceptions being two ending in  -o,
and two ending in -u.
	(c) Amplifiers end in  -o.
to one of two parts.

	They had tested Interglossa with learner groups, and were consciously
trying to make the language more usable.  Hence this reduction to having
the base Classical root with either an  -a for nouns (called substantives
by Hogben) or an -o for verbs and modifiers (called amplifiers by Hogben).

	Later in 1977, they had decided to scrap the idea of terminal P-o-S
markers, altogether, concluding that word order would indicate the function
of words.  At this stage, it became apparent that there were mainly two
groups of words in the emerging language, the Classical roots (or
'substantives') that could function as nouns, verbs or modifiers, and the
smaller, more primitive function words that indicated time, relationships
and questions, etc.

	I understood, at that time, that they had declared that any word could
function, within reason, as any part of speech; and that syntax was the
basis of the gramatical system.  This meant that the terminal letter was no
longer a function marker, and, because of this, the words could remain
truer to their Classical derivation ... as far as terminal letter goes.

	The various other changes that occurred between 1981 and 1992, were all
arrived at, as a result of testing the language with learner groups; and,
each change tended towards simplification and standardisation of the
language.  The getting rid of double letters from the Glosa lexicon, is a
clear example of the decision process they used. 	Another was the
generalisation, from Italian, which sounds  'ce'  and  'ci', CHAY and CHEE,
respectively, to a position where all uses of "c" before a vowel are
sounded CH.  Thus, in Glosa, 'k' became used for the hard "c" in Latin words.

	In a word or two, I would say that Clark and Ashby moved away from
Interglossa's formula-base system to derive Glosa with a more natural
relationship between the words - in which function words lead the user from
one word to the next ... there being no affixes to guide (or confuse) them.

	Next post: the Verb system.

Saluta,
 Robin

*John,
	I did not know of your long-term experience with Interglossa.  I have not
had the benefit of this, so am looking at the same change process (Ig -->
Glo) from a different perspective.  I do not want to appear too
heavy-handed in my comments supporting the Clark/Ashby revisions, because
Hogben is not able to defend himself nor demand a right of reply.

	However, I have tried to understand the changes they have made, and their
sometimes incomprehensible ways of presenting the system they have created.
 The fact that they have resisted the production of a Glosa Grammar Book
seems very odd, indeed, until you consider that most of us learnt our First
Language without resort to one.  They are trying to say that the Glosa
which they have derived is so "natural" that it doesn't need the confusion
of an imposed grammatical system; they have, of course, overestimated the
intuitive powers of the bulk of humanity, and, as Paul Bartlett intimates,
confused Anglocentrism with 'naturalism' in language.
	I still feel that Glosa is fairly close to the 'language of thought,' but
am hiding behind an unprovable hypothesis, here, so should not make this a
plank in my policy statement.

*	Here, after looking again at _Interglossa_ p49, I see a pattern that I
had not previously constructed into a percept: Hogben, as a mathematician,
included - probably subconsciously - elements of algebraic thinking into
his verb system.  Now, in reading the fine print, I deduce that this is
very abstract stuff: OK for the computer programmers and natural-born
logicians among us, but not much good for the man down the street, who has
trouble following the logic in the statement, 4ab means ab + ab + ab + ab.
Or, more wordily:-
	jh(b-f)
	John helps ( Bill not Fred )
	John helps Bill, but hinders Fred.

	OK, I have attempted to cross an uncrossable boundary, the one from maths
to semantics, but, so, I fear, has also Hogben.

	Take, for example,  "X tene A Y"  from the list John retyped for the
Glosalist.
	=  X  conserves the attribute  A   on behalf of  Y

Possibly,  "Harry tene amo Mary."  in Interglossa translates into English as

	 Harry has affection for Mary.  	

	My feeling is: more work needed.  This is precisely where Ron Clark came
in: I believe that he perceived Ig to be the most suitable language for
global scientific intercommunication, but he could see that there were
rough edges wanting smoothing, and sharp corners in need of rounding.

	Yes, in Glosa it wouldn't be so very different: Harry habe amo pro Mary.

And ~Harry amo Mary.~ [Harry likes Mary.] is alright, while ~Harry fo amo
Mary.~
[Harry strongly likes Mary.] would be better, if there really is something
going.

	The point that I am trying to make here is that with a language lacking
normal inflections, but having basic P-o-S markers, as does Ig, you are
pushing it a lot trying to get people to learn an abstract set of
mathematical relationships in liu of syntax.
	But ... this mathematical precision, that Hogben built into Interglosa,
might be the very thing that attracts John and Paul to the 'glos(s)a family
of languages.

	However, when Clark and Ashby finally decided to take the trend to its
(logical) conclusion, and form the idea into a language whose phrases were
totally dependent on syntax for their grammar, then the angularity of Ig
just would not work.  A formula-based syntax may have worked while there
were Part-of-Speech markers, but when the language moved over into
'open-plan' mode,
where meaning was determined totally by word order, because there were no
grammatical changes to the words, then there had to be a decision between
even tighter formulae, or a strengthening of the syntactic basis.
	Syntax won.

	As a result of my time in Conlang and Auxlang, observing the various
languages, I have come to the conclusion that there are different
psychological gearings among people, in relation to the way they enjoy
language.
	Some veer towards simplification and the Lowest Common Denominator, as do
I; others revel in the complications of meaning that can be held in a
highly inflected word, as is found in the Esperantic system.

	For reasons of the natural distribution of language ability among the
human population, I have the feeling that the kindest thing to do is to
encourage, for adoption as the Second Language for Mankind, the language
that can be used by the maximum number of educable people.  It is for this
reason that I favour the Glosa 'intuitive, naturalistic' system over the
'formula -based' system of the parent, Interglossa.  The evidence I quote
is from English and Chinese, which are both languages that rely on
intuitive feel, not being rule-based.  While Chinese is uninflected, and
lacks P-o-S markers, in English, such linguistic features are only
partially present, and are minimised.

*	I will agree, that although there is a lot of detail, and it is all there
if you look for it, the style of writing is a bit dense.  I suspect that it
was only as a special favour to Hogben that Pelican agreed to publish his
work during the height of the war; and, I also guess that he was given
strict limitations on the number of pages he could use - owing to
governmental restrictions on non-military use of the very limited supplies
of the thin war-time paper.  The title _Interglossa_ should have been
followed by _Interglossa - Practice Exercises- and _Interglossa for
Travellers_, etc; but, I suspect that the lack of support for the language
combined with the war-time restrictions on civilian publishing dissuaded
Hogben from pushing for more publications and for the setting up of an
Interglossa Users' Group.

	Forced to read the "Forward" of _Interglossa_, I find the book described
as a 'first draft' to 'stimulate fresh thinking.'  Hogben also says, "The
pages which follow are the agenda for a discussion."  And he claims the
book was written during 'empty hours of fire-watching in Aberdeen'.  In the
light of all this, perhaps Glosa is a ''second draft.''

different d
>> Interglossa?
>
*	Paul Bartlett, especially, suggests that the original "spirit" has been
somewhat lost on the path to Glosa.
	In hindsight, I understand Hogben to have forged (the metaphor is to
metalworking) a ^Brave New Language^ with all the cultural enthusiasm of a
Tolkein and the art of a Joyce.  However, I also feel that, in his zeal,
Hogben created a language medium for the supermen who were to emerge from
war cabinet offices and to return from the "front" after the last bomb
dropped.
	However Britain, like most of Europe, had lost many of its 'Supermen' in
the war, had had the s* kicked out of its infrastructure, also, its
scientists were scrambling to re-establish their profession, rather than
looking for new ways to unite scientists, worldwide.  It took Britain
almost thiry years to bounce back - after the war - to a position where Ron
Clark felt ready to 'discus' Hogben's 'agenda', and to attempt to distill
the much awaited international language for scientists.
	The theme is introduced early in Hogben's December 1942 forword:-
  "Because natural science is the only existing form of human co-operation
on a planetary scale, men of science, who have to turn to journals
published in many languages for necessary information, are acutely aware
that the babel of tongues is a social problem of the first magnitude.  Men
of science more than others, have at their finger-tips an international
vocabulary which is already in existence; and a biologist who looks forward
to a health-coscious future cannot fail to recognise how popularisation of
new health standards is daily adding to the stock-in-trade of
internationally current words in daily use."

	Clark and Ashby were still working towards this super-language for science
in 1977, and the language was still quite formularised in its word
relationships ... much as John Schilke reports, " A esthe X Y", etc ... and
the then "Euro-glossa" was shaping into what I dub 'Scientific-scientific'
(a language based on the Classical terminology of science, but also using
joining words from that Classical source - not from a natlang).

	`However!  The big "however" came in 1978, when Clark and Ashby realised
that they were creating a language that, with a little smoothing, would be
usable for people who wished to save the planet, generally, and not just
for those wishing to save it through scientific means.

	Although the changes from that point were subtle and gradual, there was a
gentle move away from the mathematically formulated view of language
towards a more natural(istic) organic one ... in which the relationships
were intended to be more in line with the way the human brain worked, and,
as such, more human(istic).

	There was a gradual change in linguistic orientation away from the
mechanical Chomskyan approach to what I now understand as "Functional
Grammar".  It is this change in linguistic orientation to which, I feel,
John and Paul are reacting.  For very many people, Glosa is already so
deficient in mechanisms of redundancy, that it fails to have what they
consider to be the necessary 'feedback' information ... found in English,
for example, when "boys run" but a "boy runs".

	So, I have to say that it is my belief that the overstreamlined structure
of Interglossa - its 'brave new languge' spirit - is ideal for the
mathematically gifted with a high level of conceptual logic, but requires
more cerebration, for its use, than is available to the median man.

	In all fairness, and as a matter of urgency, I ask Paul to outline the
measures he feels necessary for Glosa to be "salvageable."

*	I have met Clarke and Ashby, and spoken to them at length, was alive
during war-time restrictions and the following post-war reconstruction
period, and have read enough of Hogben's _Interlingua_ Forward to realise
that he had made his contribution to science with the publication of this
'draft', leaving the matter open for discussion.  Tha sadness was that
Clark opened the discussion so late in Hogben's life that there was no
opportunity for a cross-fertilisation of ideas between the two.

*	I understand that in the period 1972 - 77, before I met them, Ron and
Wendy had set up experimental groups using the language as they were
working on it.  As I understand, feedback from these groups led the
authors, of what was to become Glosa, into changes that put a more 'human'
face on the language.

*	And yet, I enjoy doing logic problems because they are a stimulation and
challenge to the brain.  I do not enjoy Esperanto, because it offers the
same sort of challenge and stimulation, but I desire from it communication,
and know that there is a (are) less challenging way(s) of achieving such
communication.  Analogously, I find the 'softer' streamlining of Glosa less
of a challenge than that of the excessively elegant Interglossa.
	While I could learn the inflectional system of Esperanto, and I could
learn the verb system of Interglossa, I prefer to concentrate on the
subject matter of what I am saying or writing, rather than on the method of
delivery.  It is for this reason that I think Glosa is better for
communication than either Esperanto of Interglossa, because the medium is
less in the way of communication, than it is in these earlier forms.
	Is it "-ist" or "politically incorrect" of me to raise the 'I.Q. Factor'
here?  Auxlangers all have ability above the average [=~ 110 I.Q.], and, as
such, are better at logical relationships than the 'man/woman in the
street': we are able to play with language at a higher level of
sophistication than the (statistical) next man; but does this mean that we
should craft an auxiliary language to suit ourselves, or to suit the bulk
of mankind?

  In fact, when I was playing around with a project I called

*	I think it is possible that Interglossa could have had a much more
general testing, globally, but Hogben's timing was just unfortunate.  None
of us forsaw the extent of the "Cold War"; and most of us expected, in
1946, the return of what were known as 'pre-war conditions'.
	I believe that Clark and Ashby did give Interglossa as fair a trial as
they could.  When you consided that permission to 'redraft' the language
was given in 1972, and, by 1977, the language was still on the drawing
board, with the major modification only a change from the three-inflection
P-o-S system to a two-part grammar system (V -e; N -a or -i; Mod -o ---> N
-a; V & Mod -o), I believe that the two 'redrafters' spent five years in
trying to make Interglossa - renamed Euro-glossa, by this time - work.

	If you go from Hoben's writing of the forward to his book (1942), to the
realisation on the Internet of Conlang (1991),  that makes it almost half a
century from the conception of Hogben's dream of something better for
science, to the gathering of like minds through the marvels of the Net's
electronic interface, for the formal start of discussion on Hogben dream.
	Its a slow world we live in.

	Around the 1978 mark, Clark and Ashby had come to the conclusion that
while the basic principles of Interglossa were sound, they could not
rationally tweak the Hogben pattern any further: they had reached the stage
of needing a complete restart based on the Ig principles.  The drawing
board was wiped clean, and a rebuild was begun.  This might be the time
that Paul would say the Ig spirit was lost.

Interesting evolution, that of the POS markers -> simplified POS markers
-> no POS markers, thereby allowing the concept-word idea, which is one
of the things that attracted me to Glosa. I still tend towards the idea
that *any* word can be used as *any* part of speech. Though some words
fight me on this, insisting that they are, indeed, nouns.

But I think that allowing the words to remain truer to their classical
derivations brings in further complexities. What about the users who
lack the classical background? Or even worse, have a background which
conflicts with *the* classical background?

I saw while analyzing the dictionaries and any Glosa texts I found...

   1) Inconsistencies in the spelling of words which end in a vowel,
      usually between a/o and e/i. Sometimes even within a dictionary,
      a word will be spelled in both ways, which leads us to...

   2) Many words differ only in the final vowel (terminal, or within
      the final syllable). Substitution may create a homonym.

(I'm sorta thinking out loud here, if that can be said of email.)
I don't want POS marking, both for Simplicity and Euphony. But the lack
of consistent terminations makes spelling more difficult. What to do?

I rather like double letters, but knowing that there are *none* solves
those situations where I just can't recall whether a letter was doubled
or not. (One that bites me every time: address. Let's see, was that one
s or two. Adreso; one. Oh, wait, that's Esperanto. Adress. Yeah, that's
it. Wait a minute; doesn't look right; better look it up. Again. Doubled
s, yeah, oh, and doubled d too! Okay, got it.)

> sounded CH.  Thus, in Glosa, 'k' became used for the hard "c" in Latin words.

One letter, one sound. I like that. Except for SC, which I won't mention
because I like it, and every rule wants one (just one!) exception, and it's
like Old English (biscop, disc, Englisc, fisc (n), fiscian (v), fiscere (m),
scip, and the classic: sceat (originally dirt, or soil, haha!))

   1) Inconsistencies in the spelling of words which end in a vowel,
      usually between a/o and e/i. Sometimes even within a dictionary,
      a word will be spelled in both ways, which leads us to...

   2) Many words differ only in the final vowel (terminal, or within
      the final syllable). Substitution may create a homonym.

(I'm sorta thinking out loud here, if that can be said of email.)
I don't want POS marking, both for Simplicity and Euphony. But the lack
of consistent terminations makes spelling more difficult. What to do?

I rather like double letters, but knowing that there are *none* solves
those situations where I just can't recall whether a letter was doubled
or not. (One that bites me every time: address. Let's see, was that one
s or two. Adreso; one. Oh, wait, that's Esperanto. Adress. Yeah, that's
it. Wait a minute; doesn't look right; better look it up. Again. Doubled
s, yeah, oh, and doubled d too! Okay, got it.)

> sounded CH.  Thus, in Glosa, 'k' became used for the hard "c" in Latin words.

One letter, one sound. I like that. Except for SC, which I won't mention
because I like it, and every rule wants one (just one!) exception, and it's
like Old English (biscop, disc, Englisc, fisc (n), fiscian (v), fiscere (m),
scip, and the classic: sceat (originally dirt, or soil, haha!))

    I will reply to two related small excerpts of Robin's messages.
I notice that Robin's dates are still off. :-)

    I have begun to change my thinking slightly in this matter.  It 
is true that small children do not learn their mother tongue from a
grammar book.  However, they do learn in a context with both verbal and
non-verbal feedback from their elders.  It is this lack of context and
feedback over which I have taken exception to the "Mechanics of Glosa"
paradigmatic sentence approach.

    But perhaps not all is lost, and it may not be necessary to publish
a formal grammatical statement for didactic reasons, although I still 
think that such a statement should be available somewhere.  The
"Mechanics of Glosa" relies almost entirely on phrases and short
declarative and interrogative sentences mostly consisting of a single
clause.  Therefore, the approach does not provide enough context for
people really to learn how the language operates.

    Perhaps it could be salvageable if there were more numerous and
longer examples.  Expand the "Mechanics of Glosa" substantially, with
many more complete utterances of many types.  Add small paragraphs of
connected text.  Demonstrate word order and use of particles much more
fully.  Use examples to provide the context that the current method
lacks.  Do not assume that "everybody knows" automatically how to put
the words together.  People with widely varying language habits may
think that certain ways of doing things are "natural," but they will
differ.  *Demonstrate*, not assume.  With enough of the "Mechanics,"
people could "learn by doing" without the need for a formal statement
in teching materials.  I just do not think that the current approach 
is adequate.


On Thu, 13 Nov 1997, Robin Gaskell wrote:

> 	In all fairness, and as a matter of urgency, I ask Paul to outline the
> measures he feels necessary for Glosa to be "salvageable."

1)  Improve the "Mechanics of Glosa" as I outlined above.

2)  Get rid of the alternate words for the same thing in the
    vocabulary: one concept, one Glosa word (not one Greek, one
    Latin, or whatever)!

3)  Remove the inconsistencies in published lists, such as different
    terminal vowels for the same Glosa word; in some cases, two
    distinct Glosa words differ _only_ by their terminal vowels, so 
    the current situation invites mass confusion.

4)  Firm up the basic vocabulary to however many words are needed (my 
    estimate has been around 2000).

5)  Emphasize strongly to avoid idiomatic constructions.  (I realize 
    that Robin may disagree with me on this.)  A&C have said themselves 
    to write in "clear, unidiomatic Glosa" and then have fallen into 
    idioms themselves (at least in the few copies of Plu Glosa Nota 
    that I saw).

6)  Improve the publications.  (Ashby&Clark's personal circumstances 
    are not really relevant.)  Remove the inconsistencies between 
    publications.  Relatively small, inexpensive booklets are still 
    a good idea, but I do not consider the present ones adequate.

7)  Get Clark&Ashby to sign off on the improvements, unless they are 
    willing to do like Zamenhof with Esperanto and put Glosa in the 
    public domain.  (Above all, do not try to do as Schleyer did with 
    Volapük.)

8)  Get the word out better (however this may be done.)

9)  Start using Glosa (which I admit that I have not done too much 
    of myself).

    I have said before that I consider Glosa to be a generally good
idea.  I still do.  It's just that I do not think that it has been 
presented as effectively as it might.

take thew word as it appears in the Glosa dictionary [[and will be happy as

*	Such inconsistencies would have been avoided had the original
dictionaries been compiled from electronic databases.  The original lists
were compiled, however, by hand, using typewriters.  Thus, now .. that
computers are being applied to the job .. we can clean up former duplicate
spellings, and settle on the one (most) correct spelling for each word that
might have different spellings in different dictionaries, or in different
parts of the same dictionary.  From the research point of view, the authors
were actively experimenting with the spelling of words, and, over time,
some words did vary - maily in the terminal vowel.  Using hand editing, it
is not surprising that some words, whose spelling was revised, were not
corrected in all of their listings.

*	The different spellings are not substitutions: now that Glosa is
congealing into a regular language, we have to label the non-preferred
versions as "mistakes."  But, around the early 1980's the authors
"deregulated" the use of the final vowel to see how things would shake
down, and glosa-pe were free to select the vowel that seemed right for
them.  I consider this to have been a legitimate research ploy - then -
though the concept of 'floating' spelling might be incomprehensible to us,
now.  So, now, we have a few loose ends to tie up: this is the time for
standardisation of Glosa's spelling, with an overall guide for the
selection of terminal vowels for words, and another rule for the decision
on words that computer sorting reveals to have two, or more ways of being
spelt.
	The decision to "re-regulate" the spelling was taken because some elements
of the Classical lexicon were found to be very close, differing
only in the terminal vowel.

spelling is neatened up around the edges.  Finding alternative spellings
for the same word annoys both the pedants and those who are linguistically
naive.

*	Actually, because English features both short and long vowels, the double
letters had a very clear function in allowing the shortenning of vowels
that were not in the penultimate spot, EG 'fat'; 'fattening'.  They also
functioned to stress the doubled consonant, EG 'his'; 'hiss'.  You can
never misspell "address" again when you realise that this particular word
demonstrates both of these rules!
	Glosa, of course, has standardisation in the pronunciation of both vowels
and consonants, and so, such rules, as exist in English, have no relevance:
thus a reason for the doubling of letters does not exist.

*	This is possibly the short end of standardisation of
spelling/pronunciation: both the soft "J" of 'jump' and the soft compound
"SH" of 'fish' got lost in the shuffle.  In Glosa ~sc~ is pronounced as two
sounds "S-CH", both hard, while ~sk~ is more fluid, with the two hard
sounds running together to make "SK" as in the English word, "sky".

	While you like "fish" and "ships", I enjoy a "jolly" "jump"; time could
possibly tell if these losses are too much to pay for the standardisation
of spelling and pronunciation.

Glosa.  Short segments: "In the home," "At the office," "On the train," etc,

*	Thank you Paul for spelling it out; I am sorry that I did not see this
before, but you are quite right: the shortage of news items in "PGN", by
people other than the authors, attests to the difficulty people find in
getting started with Glosa.

be available in paper (mailable) form, as well as on the Net.  If Glosa-pe 
wrote out a text of dialogue, or gave some other example of Glosa being
used, in their particular area of interest, we should soon build up a sheaf
of context examples

*	A must.  Some find such inconsistencies intolerable, causing them to
discontinue learning Glosa.

*	A practical list, as you are defining on Auxlang, will give learners
sufficient words to practice their usage.  Personally, I found the Glosa
1000 list too limiting, so the actual size of a comfortable, working
"beginners'"	
vocabulary probably should be open to discussion.

*	If this is necessary to get people comfortable with Glosa, I agree, and
have agreed, in principle, from the start.  However, the full language will
be felt to be 'sterile' without the development of a non-literal component.
 In Auxlang, I was arguing for a facility whereby idiom and
culture-specific metaphor can be marked as ^non-literal^, when the writer
feels the need to use them - for emotional impact, or when they are
included in reported speech.

*	This could be a call for the Glosa-pe to "support their language" by
submitting news items and other articles for inclusion in the PGN.  It
might also indicate that we can submit other publications to the authors
for inclusion in the Glosa Publications Catalogue: I for example, have got
bogged down at three stories, when I should be churning out Glosa
retellings of children's stories at one a month ... for "Plu Histori pro
Ju-pe."
	Paul, I would appreciate your list of prospective titles that would
^pepper up^ the catalogue of "inexpensive booklets."

*	As far as I know, the language has reached its base-mark.  
The Public Domain:-
	. The Glosalist is a strong move in this direction.
	. My writing of children's stories was an attempt to widen the base away
from technical writing.
	. The scanning of the 6000 dictionary, and the subsequent reversing of
entries, from Gl-->Eng to Eng-->Gl, was an attempt to standardise spelling
and dictionary entries.
	. Bill Patterson's continuation with the dictionary rationalisation works
towards making the dictionaries Public.
	. Your work in deriving the standard Auxlang word list is a guide we
should aim to conform with.
	. Use of Glosa in the field ... should call in volunteers to correspond
with people in the Third World, who are ^putting their stamp on^ Glosa usage.
	. As more people contribute towards the development of the language and
its literature, then we will continue the move over into the Public Domain.

>8)  Get the word out better (however this may be done.)
*	This is the hardest to solve.  As media become syndicated and
centralised, and as dangerous concepts like "economic rationalism" and
"political correctness" gain currency, the idea of World Community becomes
unpopular.  In theory, the Internet should provide the route to the world ...
but, then, we still have the English language barrier to overcome, as you
have mentioned before.

>9)  Start using Glosa.  [  .......  ]  
*	This does seem the clue; and the preparation of suitable demonstrations

 -----------------------------------------------------
"mi es itera in Uganda" - elsewhere in PGN 82 is a photo of Herbert and
Wendy   together in Italy.
"na mira lingua" - Herbert thinks Glosa is pretty good.
"RUGGOTEC" - an enterprising initiative: with government encouragement,
Herbert and friends have set up a park where tourists can see the famous
Mountain Gorillas, where .. coincidentally .. they might also learn about
Glosa (signs, publications, Gorilla information in Glosa, etc).
"pa merka 3 akra" - amid crushing poverty have organised enough money to 
  buy land.
"pa tekto u via" - actually being practical.
"space pro u domi" - to run RUGGOTEC, I presume.
"U centra nu es un NGO" - if this means it is a governmentally registered 
  NGO, then well-wishers from the affluent countries can send in moribund
technical equipment without incurring the otherwise prohibitive import
duties.
"publika id ci in Uganda e extra-landa" - organised enough to publish their 
  work globally.
"In januari mi pa duce u proto stude-setimana." - have run a week's course
on   Glosa.
"pa grafo un idio sko-bibli pro u-ci ergo." - a group wrote their own
instruction manual for the Glosa course.
"pa proto doci Glosa in sko-do fo proxi RUGGOTEC" - regular lessons near the 
  Gorilla Park.
"na ne habe sati valuta. Anti-co na gradu progresi" - getting results, with
  help from outside, despite real poverty in Uganda.
"A-nu 26 regio habe plu membra" - Uganda has more regional Glosa groups than 
  Glosalist has subscribers.
"qi es fo zelo" - not just 'a little bit' "zelo."
"RUGGOTEC fu es u centra de info e aktivi pro u-ci ergo" - and maybe a
world   centre for Glosa, one day.
"place dura auxi na" - I take this exhortation personally.

 &&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&&
So beautifully written, too: I understood every word, and there were no
concept clusters.
My comments, above, are understated.
We affluents discuss Glosa academically, while the impoverished embrace it
whole-heartedly.

If I could afford to migrate to the Mountain Gorilla Park, to-morrow, I would.

Saluta,

Oooooohhh, yecch! As nostalgic as I get at times, that's one thing
I do *not* miss. I always liked typewriters because they made my
writings look so much better, but oh the sadness I felt when well
into a page and suddenly realizing that I'd spelt 'adress' again a
few lines back. But I still think carbon paper was pretty cool.

I like that idea. How did it turn out? Did any significant trends emerge?
I wonder if two of the words for 'snow' came from this period: nifa & nivi.

I confess that due to my Esperanto background I have to fight the tendency
to end nouns with -o and adjectives with -a. But I do like 'noktu'.

If there were no pairs of words that differed only in the terminal vowel,
then it wouldn't matter what terminal vowel was used; though a good choice
of terminal vowels might help differentiate words which would otherwise
sound too similar. Like the 'nifa' and 'nivi' I mentioned above, though
that's a pretty bad example because they *do* mean the same thing. But
'nif' and 'niv' would be harder to distinguish than, say, 'nifa' and 'nivi'.

What sort of guide for the selection of terminal vowels? Perhaps data
from the period of deregulation would be helpful here. What did people
prefer?

But the Glosa Basic Reference says "SC as the 'sh' sound in neSCience",
and my dictionary says that's pronounced "nesh'i-ens". Perhaps GLOSAREF
is speaking here of older Glosa? Paul? Help! Robin's unexcepting my

    I inadvertently deleted some of Robin's recent messages, but as I
recall he was remarking about my reference to new small booklets which
could be added to the "catalog" of existing Glosa publications.  No, I
think new publications should *replace* some of the existing
publications, which I consider unstaisfactory.  It would be feasible 
to maintain the stapled-page A5 format with an expanded "Mechanics of
Glosa" (and not just dialogue, incidentally) together with a corrected,
standardized, and slightly expanded vocabulary without the booklets
becoming too much larger than they are now.  Whether G.E.O. would acept
replacement publications, I do not know.

*	In theory, we will get the best results, for all, if ideas and opinions
are pooled - hopefully resulting in a concensus.  But this is a statement
of the idealised situation.  The "replacement" ploy depends on the putting
together of alternatively worded leaflets, and, in some cases, considerable
original work to come up with exercises and examples that are more suitable
for learners than are the present ones: this might involve some hammering
out of policy on instructional methods .. and even of gramatical principles.
	"Replacement" also involves some retooling at Glosa Central, and this is
not without cost.  Originals of Replacement leaflets would have to have
printing plates prepared: there could be a cost-based inertia here,
opposing change.

*	Agreed, I must raise the matter with the authors, who are on the net at 
 glosauk{at}cix{dot}compulink{dot}co{dot}uk .  For economic reasons replies to our emails
will be by snail mail.
	The current work with dictionary rationalisation, at present being mainly
done by Bill Patterson, is to this end.  But the economics of retooling
would still be a consideration for the authors.

with them, I suggest that we all pray for a wealthy sponsor for Glosa; and,
meanwhile, cross our fingers that sales of present books generate the
capital that would be needed for their replacement.

Glosa has always attracted me on account of its emphasis on minimal
grammar.  However I do not believe in no grammar at all. 

I have not found Glosa really easy to understand.  I prefer the basic
vocabulary of Ido with which I am much more familiar.

I am in favour of grammatical freedom in Ido.  Then Ido can be written
in different ways.  One can write using minimal grammar e.g. me skrib
Ido nun per uz di radik-vort.  Of course, there must be a sufficient
number of vowels to make the pronunciation easy.  I think it is a good
idea, in general, to indicate the verb.

Best Wishes

Tom
 -------------------------------
	So, actually Thomas is an honest person, a good guy, and - in Glosa terms
- a statistic.
RESPONSE??
  Do we all study Ido to see exactly what its attraction is?
  Should we try to understand the different psychological gearings people
bring 	with them to the Language Reform process?
  After finding all of the Glosa words in either the Latin or Greek
dictionary, and assuring people that the Classical lexicon is well 		known
to scientists and people who have studied the Humanities, do 	 	we try to
understand a preference for "the basic vocabulary of Ido"?
  Do we recognise that, for some people, a simple statement of the
functioning 	of the grammar behind Glosa is necessary?
  Might we take Thomas' "defection" to Ido as a sign that the "NO GRAMMAR"
tag, 	as well as being factually wrong, is also misleading to the point of 
	being counter-productive?
  Do the people who understand the functioning of Glosa present the
language in 	its more "kindergarten" form so that people can " .. find
Glosa really 
	easy to understand .. " as did the school children at Atlanta's Oak
Ridge Middle School?
  Do we look into the rigidity/flexibility dimention of Glosa's syntax-based
	grammar .. to demonstrate to new learners places where the syntactic
pattern is prescribed, and where variations can occur without loss of
meaning?
  Might we look into "verb marking" or find some educational way of
ensuring 		that users, through proper use of syntactic structures, make it
quite 		plain where their verbs are?
  Or do we do all of the above?

CRISIS POINT
	As I see it, the question of Glosa's unspoken grammar is due to 'come out
of the closet' so that new learners, of a psychological gearing like Tom's,
can enjoy and get on with the language.

	Do we teach people that Glosa is, in point of fact, "head final"?  Years
of Conlang membership resulted in my gleaning that this is the accepted
technical description of phrases in which the substantive word is last.  I
guess that we could find some appropriate way of presenting this fact to
new learners - using non-technical language - so they could avoid
guess-work on this essential point of Glosa grammar, right from the start.

	Do we teach people that 'elision' is alive and well and in Glosa?  By this
I mean that the 'telegramatic' style of Glosa, which would be equivalent to 
its vernacular form, if it had a community of speakers of ~living Glosa~,
has bits left out.  For the new learner, which bits have been left out, and
from where, can become a critical question in their ability to progress
with the language.  In the same way that children speak 'baby language'
before progressing to the vernacular, I propose that Glosa learners be
taught to use 'babi Glosa' with all the missing bits in place, before they
learn to 'intuitively' drop out the 'elidable' words.
	An pa ki ad an domi.  ...............  He went home.
	An pa ki a domi.  ...................  He went home.
	An pa ki domi.  .....................  He went home.
	An ki domi.  ........................  He goes home.

	On 'marking' the verb, I could imagine writing:-
	U kanis pa VORA u felis. 
but this would be an imposition equivalent to the German capitalisation of
nouns.  And, Paul Bartlett would hasten to demand that I tell him how to
pronounce a capitalised word differently from its lower-case form.
Actually, I would have to request that people doubled their decibels or
went up, or down, an octave to emphasise the verbs.
	Back to the drawing board: maybe it would just be easier to teach people
to use an accepted form of Glosa syntax, so that the verb, or verb phrase,
was obviously apparent - by inspection - every time.  And I am still
actively looking for a way of colouring words in e-mail, so that verbs were
red and nouns green.  Once it was up and running, I think modifiers should
be blue, with  adjectives light blue, and adverbs a darker shade.  Jokes
aside, this could help learners - as it obviously would have done in Tom's
case: does anyone have any technical data on how I can implement this in
Eudora Pro Ver 3, or in HTML for offline reading from disk?

	Ave Thomas!

Saluta,
 Robin

>   Do we all study Ido to see exactly what its attraction is?

I've studied Esperanto a lot and Ido a little. Of the two I think I'd
prefer Ido if I hadn't already invested so much time in Esperanto, and
if Ido were more widely used.

Ido shares much of its vocabulary with Esperanto but there are also many
differences. Of particular interest to me: although classic Esperanto
forms opposites by negation (as in right and opposite-of-right for
right and left), Ido has separate words for these antonyms (although
the negation-method would be understood also). But in literary Esperanto,
and often in everyday conversation, the separate words are often used.
It seems to me that as people expand their vocabularies, they prefer to
have separate words for such antonyms. This would also make the meaning
more clear under circumstances in which a word fragment might be missed,
possibly inverting the meaning!

The grammar of Ido seems to fall somewhere in between that of Esperanto
and Glosa, as Tom has found. While Ido retains some inflections, it
discards others, using syntax instead. For example, while Esperanto
requires inflection of a direct object, Ido does not (*unless* the order
of the subject and object are reversed) because, as in Glosa, it is
understood that the subject (usually) precedes the object. For objects,
Ido requires inflection only when the user does something unusual.

Perhaps the vocabulary of Ido is more recognizable to many of us because
it is based upon languages of today (or not so long ago), while that of
Glosa is based upon their ancestors, older forms.

Every language has a grammar. Some are just simpler than others. While
Ido forms a plural by changing a final '-o' to '-i', Glosa does so by
using a preceding 'plu' - not so different, really, though Glosa has
the advantage of word invariability. And this touches on something that
I've observed. The most common spelling inconsistency that I've seen in
Glosa texts is in final vowels. And this troubles me also. In Ido or
Esperanto, I know that a noun ends in '-o' (unless pluralized, but *we*
could use 'plu' instead), and if a word ends in '-o', then it's a noun.

> Do we teach people that Glosa is, in point of fact, "head final"?

Yep. Head Final and SVO (Subject-Verb-Object).

That's a good idea! But there's really no way to do this in email for
everybody. If your mailer supports color, chances are most of your audience
will have mailers that don't, or that do it differently. Standardization
hasn't yet matured enough. HTML's another story: just wrap your text in FONT
elements; I think most browsers today can handle this. And some mailers,
too. For example, a red Hello and a green world!...

<FONT COLOR=#FF0000>Hello,</FONT> <FONT COLOR=#00FF00>world!</FONT>

(If your mailer can handle it, some of you might be seeing the colors
instead of the code!) The sixdigit hexadecimal number after the #
represents the amounts of red, green and blue to use, ranging from 00 (none)
to FF (maximum) for each. Cyan, with no red and equal parts green and blue,
would be #008080 or something close to it. Some browsers can understand
COLOR=BLUE and such, but some don't, so it's best to use the numbers. Also,
you may not get exactly the colors you want. It depends on how many colors
your computer supports.

Hello to Ron & Wendy and Glosalist subscribers,
	Well, this is the second rasberry to arrive on my screen, this week, 
claiming that Glosa is not easy to use.
	Kjell is Swedish, and this might be a significant factor in his not
finding Glosa easy to read.  I will write to Kjell privately, asking for
more constructive feed-back on the difficulties he finds with Glosa: of
course, he has no Glosa dictionary at all.
	He likes Interlingua and uses it in his postings to Auxlang, which I don't
take the time to read; although I can sort Interlingua out, by inspection,
it still takes too long.  I had assumed that if Interlingua can be
'understood' by me, my Glosa postings would similarly be understandable to
Interlingua speakers: but, not so, it seems.
	The following is my translation into Glosa from an original segments in
Interlingua, English and Rap Lin Rie.  The first section (omitted), from
which I translated from a combination of the English and Interlingua
versions, was not included by Kjell.  We play these translation games in
AUXLANG.

it had met during its adventurous escape. The neighbor came over
again, this time to congratulate the farmer on his good fortune.
Only to be told once again "Who knows what is good or bad?"  True

had started a war and the following day soldiers came by to draft young

    There is, I think, a misapprehension on the part of Glosa-pe about
the recognizability of Glosa words.  I personally doubt that many of
them are as immediately recognizable as thought or hoped.  Lots of
people may *use* words which contain Greco-Latin roots without really
knowing the _meaning_ or those roots themselves.  Those people probably
use the root-containing words as semantic wholes.

    Good job, Robin.  I would make only a couple of remarks.

1)  I think nearly every instance of 'pa' could have been omitted
    (the "historical present").

2)  'Pra' seems no longer to be part of standard Glosa, only
    Gaskell-Glosa.

3)  'U(n)' is a noun marker that need not be used before an obvious
    noun such as 'X-pe'.

4)  It might be worthwhile, as a sort of appendix, to list those words
    which were not taken from any of the so-called "Glosa 1000" lists
    but rather from Glosa 6000 or some other source, in order to help
    determine which words might profitably be added to the basic
    vocabulary (which collation shows to be more like Glosa 1500).

(As an aside, would you consider indenting the first lines of your
paragraphs fewer than eight spaces?  So much indentation causes
unsightly wrap-around on my display.)
