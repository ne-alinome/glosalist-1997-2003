"dog's food"     ~kani vora-ma~  ~kani sito~

"dog voraciousness"   ~kani fo-vora-volu~   ~kani fo-famina~  ~kani edace~

> I would not accept your sentence as valid except as

The 'particles' are only required if you want to be specific and context
doesn't make it clear.

I don't think ~vora~ can be understood as 'voracious'.
'Voracious' = 'very hungry' = ~fo-famina~

> > ~Galina ne es boni kaso kani vora~    Chicken isn't good as a dog meal.

~medio~ is average as far as I know.
How do go you get ~boni kaso~ = average?

Another possibility would be to use ~kani~ as an imperative verb -
~Kani vora!~     Dog the meal!  (=Eat the meal like a dog would do!)

Yes, adding either -MA or FO- does make it clear.

Right, but that is maybe half of the time; people like to elide
where possible, but need a convenient idiom to specify when
needed. That can be via morphology or syntax or both.

> > Vora kani es u menace.          Voracious dogs are a menace.

I was thinking more like "biting dogs", fixated as I was on
participles. Since then, I have found -NT- embedded in so many
Glosa roots, I feel free to use that productively. Now it's
the GE- that seems redundant ...

Any run of morphologically undistinguished roots is ambiguous; this
could be "boni caso kani" + "vora", or "boni caso" + "kani vora",
or ... This is sometimes called an attachment ambiguity.

> Another possibility would be to use ~kani~ as an imperative verb -

Or more idiomatically, "Pig out! Wolf it down!" ...

~Kani, qi morda, es u menace.~       Biting dogs are a menace.   (ie dogs
that bite)

True. I was attempting to use ~kaso~ prepositionally here, meaning "in the
case of". Would perhaps ~Galina ne es boni de kani vora~  have been clearer?

And it's not that I hate dogs, really ...

> ~Kani, qi morda, es u menace.~       Biting dogs are a menace.   (ie dogs that bite)

According to the Authorities (originally Hogben),
it should be "kani; qi ..." but such abuse of a
semicolon is too foolish to even discuss.

> ~Morda kani es u menace.~    Biting dogs is a menace. (ie people that bite dogs)

Infinitive: MORDARE kani es ...

> ~Morda ex kani es u menace.~   Biting dogs are a menace.   (ie dogs that bite)

Active participle: MORDANTE kani ...

Of course, this would spoil Glosa's ability to claim that it has no grammar
or at least no morphology. But I think the authors A&C never really intended
it as a true pidgin-creole, but rather as a semi-naive relexing of English.
Hogben meant something different altogether, but his ideas were just
the outline of a very strange project, one that appealed strongly to me
30 years ago, and seems quite silly now; A&C improved it greatly.

> ~Morda de kani es u menace.~   Biting dogs is a menace.   (ie people that bite dogs)

I think the more international usage is "Morda A/AD ..."

Yes, anything that breaks up a long noun phrase will help.
I would try "Galina ne es boni PRO ...".

Changing now preferences ++ --> 1 as described, I am continuing the 
work on the dictionary.  I am slow, but it is a (little) more 
interesting thing than typing in dictionary pages.  Nick's comments 
are helpful, thanks.  I will upload the advances on my homepage 
monthly and announce it here in Glosalist. 


My first impressions, doing the ++ --> 1, do not surprise:

* A lot of inconsistencies disappear from Bill's dictionary 
  automatically only by prefering Glosa 1000. 
* Words with more than two syllables are suspicious. 
  (Most of them are Glosa-6000s containing ugly Latin 
  part-of-speech-markers.  Mostly a better two-syllable synonym 
  from Glosa 1000 can be found with the E5kG1k-list.) 
* Glosa is beautiful. 


What do you prefer for "to eat"?  "Fago", "sito" or "vora"?  Charles's 
list gives no answer.  I like "fago" most. 
("fago" is aorist to Greek "esthio", the normal verb for "to eat".  
"sito" is from the normal Greek word for food, "sitos", but a noun. 
"vora" is Latin, but the normal Latin word for "to eat" is "edo". 
The following compounds should be harmonized to only one of the three: 
fago-ma [food]{1 compound}; 
dona sito a [feed], idio sito [diet], kapti sito [bait], longi sito-va 
[through] {???}, sito-avi [fowl], sito-bo-pe [grocer], sito-fito 
[vegetable], sito-ka [pantry], sito-va [hamper], sukro-sito [pudding] 
{10 compounds, on with ???}; 
cefa vora [dinner], devora [eat rapidly] {bad prefix!!!}, homi-vora 
[cannibal], mega vora [feast], meso-vora [lunch], pluto vora [banquet], 
vespera-vora [supper], vora gra [graze], vora mo [breakfast]{9 compounds}) 

Saluta - Marcel

Compounds are important; there may be easy Glosa equivalents
for (de-)vour, voracious, herbivore, omnivore, carnivore;
esoPHAGus, sarcophagus, anthropophagy; paraSITE.
But "mangia" (munch) sounds best, though spelled oddly ...

Good. I am glad to hear this good news about the dictionary. Look forward to
seeing the updates.

Yes, I like the Greek words too. If you can have only one, then ~fago~ gets
my vote.

Yes, that's right.  ~sito~ = ~fago-ma~

~longi sito-va~ [trough]  (a receptacle for food for animals - "Trog")

This would have a "hard" G as in Get?

More likely the authors took MANGIARE from Italian.
MANG- looks like "mango". Maybe the Glosa phonology
simply does not support (should not allow) MANGIA.
Or, my proposal to use J could be invoked: MANJA.
Then there's a conflict with MANIA unless J is
always pronounced as soft-G, as it *should* be.

Glosa (Ron Clark) chose to eliminate doubled letters
and use K for hard-C. Such in-my-opinion misguided
phoneticization generates many problems like these.
I suppose the answer is to eliminate all troublesome
roots like MANGIA, because others can always be found
that *will* fit his procrustean orthography.

J, of course, is pronounced as Y in Yes.

This seems to be the key problem.  Not Greek enough, after
all.   (Cf. Iesu: Greek, Ido and Langland's English, which thanks
to the Reformation with its German origins became Jesu(s).)  A
needed letter is being wasted, here.

And I can't forbear adding:  German learners of Ido are explicitly
enjoined not to put a curly bit on the bottom of the "I".  The
letters are entirely interchangeable to them, presumably.  

(Again, that is fine, again I'm not knocking the Germans; but why
waste the letter in Glosa, an invented language in which the
matter was not historically determined, but was at the entire
option of the inventor?  Is it too late to make a needed
change?  Whence cometh, exactly, the necessity for the German J
in Glosa?)

Vulgar/Ecclesiatical Latin and the Romance languages changed
consonantal U/I into V/J, or something like that, and it seems
like a good idea to me. But we still have the C/K and G/J
"problems" in Glosa. There isn't any other way of doing soft-G,
and the -ia combination is used instead of J as originally stated.
So it is tempting to pronounce J as soft-G and say MANJA.

But I prefer the Occidental solution of using the same
old I-before-E rules we all know since childhood ...
eliminating K altogether. What is the most international
(European) method? Nobody uses K except some very few
interlinguists! Glosa is mired in a naive phoneticism.

Some of the things you say Catty really bug me. This is one
of 'em. First the Occidental solution isn't really a solution at
all. It is problem that gets set aside far too often. Jespersen
dealt with it the same way Rosenberger and even Pirro dealt
with it... that is they represented the sound as "fonetik"-ly as
possible. And there were more than a few, you can check the
Auxilingua Project Pages and get a clue about the different
language projects that did the same. It is not naive to use
K instead of a C with double sounds. It is, however, naive
to say that Occidental is the solution. If Occidental is the
solution then practice Occidental. Glosa is good enough
for me with its Ks and I see no problem in it.

Since,
Jay B.

Subject: [glosalist] other IALs of similar analytic type
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Tue, 05 Sep 2000 20:50:14 -0700


I am re-reading some of the early Kosmoglott magazines,
edited by Edgar De Wahl, deviser of Occidental/Interlingue.
In those days the IAL options were mainly Espo-Ido,
Peano's Interlingua, and Occidental in-between. In my
previous reading I skipped anything not concerning OCC,
but there were many articles by Peano and others about
(and/or written in) their own language projects.
This time I'm reading them all ... except Esperanto,
which I cannot penetrate due to its mangled roots.

Besides Interlingua's great resemblance to Glosa,
as remarked by somebody on this list earlier, I find
some other interesting foreshadowings of Interglossa/Glosa.
These were well-received and never criticized by OCC-ists;
I think EDW would be more "analytical" today than he felt
was possible then, due to prevalence of Latin in schools.

Most of this is rather easy to understand at first sight,
but some details are difficult. The most radical of the
writers is Nik Yucmanof of Petropol, in his all-lower-case
(proletarian?) language/notation "Etem". Sometimes he revues
other langs of similar type, one of which is called "Glott"
and has some interesting parallels with Glosa. (So here I'm
trying to revue a revue of a lang in a lang in a lang!)

: "glott" usu alfabet anglo-latin

: gramatik de "glott" es analitic.
: numer es indikat per numerativ (du soldat)
: aut per artikul: definit "la" (sing.), "les" (pl.),
: indefinit "un" (sing.), "plures" (pl.);
: deklin es fakat per "preposision":
: "de la patre", "ad la matre"", ...;

(More stuff too similar to Glosa deleted)

: adverbi et adjektiv ne es diferensiat;
: verb es interesant: radik de id es ekstrakt
: eks parol intereuropean ko "-or, -iv, -ur, ...",
: ergo: "amat, skript, decis, evolut ...";

(In other words, verbs are taken from the Latin
perfective/supine as is usual in English. Good idea!)

: sintakt es preferet logikal, simil a tip angl.
: stil es mult klar.

"Still"? Hmph.

: parol-formasion es simpl: sufiks et prefiks
: korespond a id de "occidental"

Which in turn corresponds to Espo-Ido.
In those days nobody dared present a project
lacking a credible system for word-derivation.

: selekt de leksik es tal: radik et parol,
: difus in omni lingu european, es akseptat
...
: in mank de parol inter-european, on selekt radik,
: komun a du famili lingual: "automne" (roman et angl),
: "fenestre" (germano-roman), "columbe" (romano-slav)

That's a refreshingly simple and effective algorithm.

This all confirms the "all eurolangs are dialects of
a single international lang" hypothesis. Nothing is
really new about Glosa, and previous analytic projects
have been better in some important ways.

Odd, that all these East-European language designers have
bypassed Greek for Latin roots, whereas Hogben and A&C ...

    That does bring up one thing which I think has been somewhat
questionable all along about the design of both Interglossa and Glosa
going back to Hogben himself, namely, the assumption that because many
people use words containing Greek roots, they somehow know the meaning
of those roots as if they were lexical atoms.  Elsewhere I have termed
this the Hogben Fallacy.  These days, I suspect that even scientists or
biological taxonomists consult dictionaries or even classical scholars
to help with the coining of new terms or Linnaean-type names.  I have
enough of a smattering of classical education that I can sometimes
recognize the roots in new coinings, but I suspect that most people
can't.  As best I recall without digging out my photocopy, Frater,
which was devised by a Vietnamese and published in Saigon, was rather
Glosa-like but leaned more to Latin roots (although with its
deliberately restricted phonology, there was a bit of mangling).

Hogben wrote in his book "INTERGLOSSA" (chapter 2) -

"Since Interglossa is an isolating (analytical) language, learning
Interglossa involves learning merely: (a) its etymology, i.e. mnemonic
association of each vocable to an internationally current root (Chapter XI);
(b) its semantics, i.e. analysis of the meaningful content of the vocables;
(c) its word-order; (d) its phonetics and typography."

This indicates to me [see (a) above] that he expected people to be familiar
with words like "telephone" and "microscope", whilst not knowing the
meanings of the elements that make up these words, since he says they must
"learn" the etymology.

"With a few exceptions the vocables of Interglossa are based on unmutilated
roots of words which now belong to the vocabulary of all countries where
modern technology and hygiene have penetrated. The meaning ascribed to any
one of them does not necessarily tally with the one given in a Latin or a
Greek lexicon. It is the meaning suggested by the internationally current
words in which it occurs."

This again indicates that the basis of Interglossa was this "international"
vocabulary and not a knowledge of Latin and Greek words.

Ashby & Clark, writing in "CENTRAL GLOSA" (page 9), give as the second
educational benefit of learning Glosa that -

"The great number of technical terms a modern student has to comprehend and
memorize get meaning through Glosa and so become easily memorable."

This must mean that they, like Hogben, did not believe that people already
knew the meaning of the Greek and Latin roots that make up these technical
terms.

In "The Loom of Language" by Frederick Bodmer (and edited by Lancelot
Hogben) writing about the favourable points of INTERLINGUA [Latino sine
flexione]

"Interlingua has NO mobile derivative affixes to juggle with. It is wholly
analytical, like Chinese or, we might almost add, Anglo-American. What
prefixes and suffixes remain stick firmly to the Latin or Greek loan-word
with all their diversity of meaning, contradictions and obscurities in
English, French, or Spanish usage."

Some one-time eminent support for my view of the inadvisability of the
attempted analysis of Glosa words into "meaningful" elements!

Greek roots were usually tiny vague formative elements, not meaningful
in themselves; even what look to us like "roots" have a substructure.
Sometimes it seems there are no roots, only thicker branches.
Even in PIE roots, which were nearly/approximately C-C, there were
families of related meanings associated with certain consonants,
especially added onto the C-C pattern (vowels were ablauted).

> association of each vocable to an internationally current root (Chapter XI);

This has a clearer meaning: Hogben was thinking like "GRAPHein = write",
which would be compounded lexically rather than morphologically, IIUC.
He did not intend separate word-roots for TELEGRAPH, PHOTOGRAPH, etc.
But it's difficult to know, since he did not stay long with the project,
and his writing is the most unclear of any professional writer I have read,
especially in its syntax.

I think he meant to have "tele-fone, mikro-fone, etc", with the roots
rather prominently exposed. People do know these roots, but they are not
specific and "scientific" as in Ido. Same for the prefixes RE- DE- etc.
The way that language works is by analogical extension, not by precise
logical definition. My degree is in math, but that sort of logic doesn't
apply to human vocabulary. Humans use a more productive natural kind
of (ana-)logic. So, I finally learn to love the vague affixes and roots.

[equivocal Hogben quote snipped]

> This again indicates that the basis of Interglossa was this "international"
> vocabulary and not a knowledge of Latin and Greek words.

Ambiguous: Are we looking at scientific combining forms like "cardio-"
or common international vulgar (90% latinate) forms like "cord-ial"?

> "The great number of technical terms a modern student has to comprehend and
> memorize get meaning through Glosa and so become easily memorable."

These build-your-vocab-through-etymology claims are nothing new.
I went through a course once ... and hated the vagueness of the affixes.
I think it is better to simply collect the word-families (which are
present even in Glosa) and let human powers of pattern recognition
work their magic:

 accessibility
 accessible
 accession
 accessory
concession
concessionary
concessive
 incessant
precession
procession
processor
 recession
 recessionary
 recessive

Now, if you pronounce each word aloud slowly, you come to know
what "CESS-" means in English, without being able to explain it
in any precise way. This is the (only) way that all language works.

> This must mean that they, like Hogben, did not believe that people already

> terms.

I agree with your analysis, but give it a different interpretation.
The root CESS- is certainly used in Glosa as above. But because of
Glosa's, ahem, mutilated phonetic spelling, CEDERE/CESSUS=cede has
meshed with CESSARE=cease to make hash of the derivational series:

cede      cede, surrender, yield
no-cede   resolute
cesa      cease
reced     recede  go back
recense   revise book
recesi    recess
procede   forward
procesa   process
procesi   process
procesio  procession

This could be untangled by using CED- vs. CESS-, or some such;
or final vowels could be used systematically, CESE- CESA-.
It requires a reform of the whole vocabulary to cure these ills.

Good reference. But again it confuses me: at first I think of
true analytical languages like Chinese or Malay or creoles,
which use productive-compounding rather than morphological affixes;
neither Interlingua nor Glosa do that predominantly. The one uses
Latin words directly, which embed a Latin morphology minus only
the syntactic affixes, *not* minus the semantic extensions.
The other (Glosa) naively jumbles words from any random source,
with separate words for different syntactic uses ...
How you gonna use "PROLONGA" as multiple parts of speech?

Except that the authors support my p.o.v. strongly in their list
of vague semantic prefixes. I already posted them here recently.
Please account for the following few examples using your theory:

palin- G    back again
para- G     beside
per-        thorough, through
peri- G     around
po-, post-  after
pre-        before
pro-        forward, favor

It isn't your fault; Glosa is just inconsistent and unprincipled.
It needs an overhaul, revision, reform, redesign; and desperately.
(I've returned to this opinion after examining vocabulary recently.)

I am thinking of gathering together thoughts from many people
about how to use and perfect "the international language".
This would be some sort of web page accessible also by email.

It would not resemble the mud-wrestling pits of AUXLANG,
and such troublesome troll-people would be excluded;
also, anonymous questions and postings would be permitted.
Most especially encouraged would be messages written in
experimental hybrids between various IALs; but likely, the
naturalistic types would predominate (Occidental, Glosa, etc).

Anyone who is interested, please contact me directly
rather than through this list, and we can make it happen.
I need a little input before commencing.

    You have a good point here.  I do not possess a copy of
"Interglossa" and have only had the opportunity to peruse a copy
hastily.  I found Hogben's style a little hard to follow.  However,
apart from what Hogben himself may have written, as you generously
quoted (and I have snipped for space), some have at least represented
Hogeben, or his following, so to speak, as if he/they were saying that
people should/would know the meanings of etymological roots.

How do you make that happen?  Moderated lists are troublesome
things.  Lotta work, lotta responsibility.  I don't think anyone
has succeeded as you intend to do.  Good luck.

One approach, possibly, would be to require the discussions to be
in "Occidental, Glosa, etc".  That would provide a barrier to idle
entry and somewhat discourage facile controversy.  Those who had
the impertinence to design a language for others without knowing a
couple of IALs themselves would choose to go elsewhere.  Those who
knew a couple would be able to handle any of the "etc" languages
that met your criteria, not without a little effort, but with a
degree of it acceptable and interesting to language designers.

That approach has, of course, been tried in the bablo list, with
only moderate success, but the bablani are by definition a less
expert group, and there is not the restriction to naturalistic
languages that you contemplate.

If you want to do it in English in an international mailing list
you need to justify the use of English as an IAL.  There is some
incongruity in an English-language list of this kind, I think.

The "naturalistic" is the bugbear.  It is there I think you will
go wrong.  I don't know if you have a clear meaning for it.  Does
it mean there will be excessively complex, or undefined, rules of
derivation, or will the words (as I think you intend) be
invariable?  Does it mean just that the vocabulary will come from
a few languages that arose in one part of the globe?  In other
words, the contrary of a priori?  If so, perhaps there is a better
word than "naturalistic".

Basically, I'm convinced that a naturalistic language can't be a
world language.  What is needed is an autonomous language, one
amenable to complete definition, and indeed, completely defined.  
Not a semi-artificial languages.

Personally I'm pretty clueless, but the only world languages I
know of are Esperanto, Ido, and Glosa.  And I'm doubtful about the
last.  Occidental is not a candidate, mea opinione.

The Glosa Internet Dictionary on my homepage has been updated. 


Changes: 

As I wrote, I changed the preferences of the synonyms ("++" and "+") in 
advantage to Glosa-1000-words ("1").  Of course, with the English 
meanings I could not really find all Glosa synonyms because of English 
synonyms (like Bill before!). 

Then, as Charles suggested (and later rejected), I took Paul's 
Base-Vocabulary-list (ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary , 
I used Charles's "mixed salad") and Rick Harrison's VITAL-list 
(http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) and put the Glosa 
words to these English words into the "Core"-dictionary.  Sometimes I 
could not find a fitting Glosa word for the English in the Internet 
Dictionary or I did not like the found word.  These missing words are 
listed (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm ).  Please have a look. 
Perhaps you know good Glosa words for them. 

Nick's comments (again thanks, follow-ups are welcome) have been built 
in as far as I was able to. 

A lot of error correcting and meaning harmonization is done.  All is 
protocoled in www.tuhh.de/~smms/gidhist.txt.gz . 

The new "Core"-dictionary has now 1991 Glosa items.  1761 of them are 
Glosa-1000s (= 88 %).  Before it was 1941/729/38 %. 
The new "Basic"-dictionary has 4634, 2695 Glosa-1000s, 58 % 
(before 5026/965/19 %).  The whole Internet Dictionary has 8481 Glosa 
items. 



I tried hard to handle the data carefully and with respect to Bill, the 
Richmonders and the spirit of Glosa.

I believe, the "Core"-dictionary is quite useful now !!! 
(Glosa-English www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcoglen.htm and 
 English-Glosa www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcoengl.htm )



... but it is far away from being ready.  Here some tasks to do. 
Some are small, some not: 

* I feel not satisfyed with all of the 1705 " + "-words ("Basic"-words, 
  not in "Core" nor in Glosa-1000).  Suggestions and help are needed. 
* There are English words in Paul's Base-Vocabulary-list 
  (ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary ) and in Rick 
  Harrison's VITAL-list (http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/vitaleng.html ) 
  wich are not in the Internet Dictionary or they are there but I did 
  not like their Glosa word.  I listed these words in 
  www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm .  Good Glosa words for them 
  should be found - or created. 
* The amount of words in "Core" and "Basic" should be optimized.  
  I think, maybe 1700 for "Core" and less than 4000, maybe 3700 for 
  "Basic" would be best. 
* I have to go through Bill's mails to Glosalist about his dictionary 
  work and his considerations.  The mails are collected in 
  www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz .  Without wanting to, I 
  certainly have destroyed some good ideas when I used the Richmond 
  data.
* The "G"s (marks of Glosa words with Greek origin) should be 
  supplemented with help of the book "Glosa 6000".  Same with 
  capitalization. 
* Some synonyms are necessary for good style and feeling comfortable 
  with a language.  But in "Core" the amount of synonyms should be 
  reduced to a minimum.  Especially the phenomenon of "different roots 
  for similar concepts" is annoying.  I started to make a list of them 
  (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gcosyn.htm ).  We could complete the 
  list and then fix this problem. 
* Alphabetical sorting ("{", "}", "[", "]") must be corrected. 
* The problem of "similar synonyms" (similar Glosa words with same 
  meaning, mostly differing from each other only in the ending vowel) 
  is not solved.  I started to make a list of them 
  (www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ).  The list should be 
  completed.  We can build up a database of classical origins to every 
  word (word pair) and of cognated words in other languages.  
  With this data we could collect examples to every Latin and 
  Greek conjugation/declination and write a "Word Derivation Scheme". 
  A start for such a scheme is www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gwds.htm 
  (it is just what I emailed before here in Glosalist). 
  With this scheme we can choose the "right" synonym or "correct" the 
  words.  Great would be an approval by Wendy Ashby. 
* A database of classical origins and cognated words of other 
  languages should be made for the "Core"-words, too.  With the 
  "Word Derivation Scheme" we could systematize the vocabulary then 
  step by step.  

And of course:
* Correct errors
* Contact W. Ashby
* Test out the dictionary by conversation and translation work
* Translate the dictionary in various languages (German, Russian, 
  French ..)

Sakri vaka! That is a lot of work! And it is very important
to Glosa's future that somebody get into these things.
I did not intend to stop your effort, but only indicate
that other lines might be more productive. Of course everyone
can/should investigate different lines of thought.
At first I thought of catching holes (lacunas) by using the
English lists, but then went off in a different direction ...

EW maner        JK mans         L manere        I rimanere      E stay, remain

I am thinking there really are "only" around 3000 important roots,
and any good IAL *must* use a system of derivation to generate
the 10 or so most-useful semantically related words per each root.
So, why not combine the efforts of the greatest interlinguists?
Edgar Wahl, Otto Jesperson, etc. I like to make cross-comparisons
between Ido, Glosa, and the more naturalistic IALs.

Glosa has a crypto-derivational non-system. It needs a complete
redesign and replacement, I really think so. Maybe we need to admit
that 10 or so grammatical suffixes are necessary in any language.
No human language I've ever heard of that passes the pidgin stage
does not have some affixes. In the Glosa vocab you can see
fossilized Latin -io -nt -te and others. At least the prefixes
re- ko- etc have a true and useful definition, and they generate
many useful words from roots hidden in Glosa, like LECT/LEKT
(the authors were not even consistent in fuhnettik spelling).
Of course it's always easier to criticize than build!

A micro-study ... I did this unix command, and got a list
of 52 Glosa words, which I reformatted a bit below:

cut -f 3 glosatest* | grep -v '[- ]' | grep '.ekt.$' | sort -u

abjekti afekta aspekti aspekto
defekti dejekti delekta detekti dialekta dialekti direkti disekti
efekti ejekti eklekti elekti erekti expekta
genuflekti hekto injekti insekti inspekti
kolekti konekti konfekti korekti
lekto nekto objekti
perfekti perspekto plekto prefekta prefekto projekti
reflekti rejekta rekti respekta respekti retrospekti
sekta sekti selekti spekta subjekti suspekta
tekti tekto vekti vekto

It's a bit of a jungle, but by disentangling it
we can reduce the 52 chaotic words to 11 nice roots:
"fekt jekt lekt nekt rekt sekt tekt vekt flekt plekt spekt".

The prefixes are familiar: "ab ad de dia dis ex in ko per
pre pro re sub super", and some few compounds like "genu".
Then maybe some missing words like "kon-vekt" appear.

Obviously there are many other groups besides "-ect".
(Wouldn't they all sound nicer using Greek "apo-" for "ab-"?)
To reduce G-8000 to manageable size, we selekt/inspekt all
these sets, then look for more patterns among the remainder.
Maybe eliminate "-fika" words with "-fect", or the reverse.

Also apparent is the random final vowel situation.
I would make them all -e for etymological and mnemonic
reasons, but there is more to it ... crypto-suffixes!

    CON- is not Glosa, KON- is.
    Where prefixes are functional in constructing neologisms, then I feel
they ought to have a place.  However, the question of using the Greek or
the Latin form, in construction, is tricky.
    My two main thoughts are that both Greek and Latin forms should be
allowed, and that the "6000" lexicon should not be altered too drastically.
 Having said that I realise there could be mounted a strong case for going
through the lexicon and stripping out all cases of a non-preferred form,
e.g. all words beginning with ~ab~ where the initial letter s have an
undefined 'prefix' quality.

    However, there are two main determinants for me:-
 1. Both function words and substantives, in Glosa, should be spelt
consistently - for the benefits of both learners and programmers working on
the machine-handling of language.
 2. The ear should be the final arbiter in accepting words: when the words
are spoken in a sentence, does the sentence flow; and, is the meaning
readily grasped, from hearing the sentence?

*   I cannot tell which is the better: ~surfacia~ has an excellent
pedigree, albeit Latinate, and is readily recognisable to most speakers of
Euro-languages.
    ~epifaci~ could be the final winner because it is closer to the
"sing-song" quality of CVCVCV.  Perhaps this is the sort of question to
ask the Asian Glosa-pe.
    Whether there is space in the lexicon for three forms of the word, I am
not sure.  IE
  face     EG  Fe pa face mu sito pro mu prima-vora.
  facia        An fu face u jardina para u Nordi facia de an domi. 
  -faci        U pani-faci makina pa produce pani pro u holo komunita.

    But I still see the idea as using ''Classical'' roots; however, I
suspect that the use of strict derivational laws will sterilise Glosa.
While I can see that fuzzy spelling will defeat the purposes of Glosa
altogether, I still feel that one, or two, well defined, and regularly-
spelt words per concept is to be aimed at; and, this was what Ron Clark and
Wendy Ashby generally derived - albeit often through intuitive means,
rather than via a formula.

*   Maybe the first two are too close in sound, though context would
certainly sort out the bean from the being.  So, an "artisan" might be a
person who makes things, a ~fabrika-pe~.

    ~U holo viki gene bene-face ex an ergo.~

*   I prefer to avoid this awkward word, by treating "laws" and "making
laws" as two different linguistic situations.
   EG  ~An sio aplika plu lega.~  He would apply the laws (legislation).
       ~Durante u lega-face procesa, fe pa skope plura mega bibli.~
        During the law-making process, she looked at several large books.

>face-do         factory
*   Seems OK.

>faci            making
*   If this is to be preserved, then I'd say it should be in the form of a
hyphenated suffix, IE ~-faci~.  And the only justification might be that
the long sound of the E at the end of the word is not as suitable as the
short sound of I for compound formation. 

>facia           face, features, surface
*   As faces and surfaces can be shown to be semantically related, this
word seems adequate for both usages.  And it is sufficiently distinct from
~face~, in sound and appearance, to warrant entry in the lexicon. 

>facu u neo ra   invent
*   I'd say that this U was one too many.
    Also, I don't know it source: at the time that the terminal vowel was
not fixed, an article could have been written including this spelling;
however, now that terminal vowels are prescribed, this "Old Glosa" should
be 'retired.'

>ge-face         artificial, produce
>ge-face ex      consist
*   Not sure of the sources of these usages: they just dont feel right.
Firstly, the ~ge-X~ form has been fairly well discussed on this list to be
the Glosa equivalent of the 'past participle' in English: I'd say either
these definitions are in error, or are archaic.
  EG
 Id pa gene ge-face intra Deutschland.

>no-face         demolish, destroy, havoc, undo
*   Don't know if I can agree with these definitions: ~no-face~ distinctly
means "un-make", and while we might 'un-make' a bed, we need a much more
drastic word to describe pulling down a building.
  EG
 U gina pa no-face u kli; qi pa previo gene ge-face ex fe fe-fili.

>su facia        surface
>su-facia        surface
*   More problems: "6000" gives 'SURFACE facia' and 'FACIA face, surface'.
    Strictly speaking, the ~su facia~ is the space above the surface.  
  EG

*   For the first question, I would take 50-50 odds: for vocabulary, Glosa
is a sort of Classico-creole; while for its construction, it is more Anglo,
but not very Latin.
    Imagine a time .. in prehistory .. when early man though little before
uttering, and barely distinguished between things and their actions.  In
such a mystic stage of evolution, the concepts echoing thought were also
closely related to the sounds used to convey these thoughts: it is
postulated, here, that proto-man used proto-language in a very loose way,
such that metaphorical usage blurred the boundaries between the concrete
and the abstract, and simple, largely un-inflected sounds were used to
string these thoughts together.
    Now imagine a time .. in post-history .. when civilised man painfully,
urgently seeks to rediscover the fundamentals of communication to
facilitate intercommunication between groups whose long linguistic
evolutions have driven them apart.  In such a time there will be attempts
to impose the most evolved of civilisation's national languages on all;
alternatively, there will be attempts to marshal the best linguistic
features into one superior language; while others will suggest a return to
some form of linguistic Lowest Common Denominator.
    As I see it, Glosa represents the thrust from this last group.  To get
man talking to man, we might have to take a few steps back - to a level of
sophistication where people from all linguistic traditions can cope.

Saluta,

Robin

Would it perhaps be more in the spirit of Glosa to use detached
word-classifier particles?  I'm thinking of something like

		agent shop = shopper
		noun reciprocate = reciprocate
		verb bath = bathe

But thinking of the last, this approach would be rather difficult.  
You would start with "bathe", and use the classifiers "place for
it" (bath), "doer of it" (bather), perhaps.  And "fixer of"
"container for" "doing of" cook = tinker.  Sorry I mentioned it.

If so, is not Glosa fatally flawed?  It seems to me that the only
alternatives are it's remediable or it's fatal.

Glosa has derivation, the problem is that it's not designed in,
it's naturalistic, and the significance of the denied affix must
be acquired along with the root as a single concept.  If we
confessed that we had roots and pre-defined affixes we would have
a more intelligible language.

Look at Sweet's chapter on derivation in English.  Look at the
treatment of that chapter in the synoptic table of contents,
giving page references to, what, 180 affixes.

Is that what you want for Glosa, the need for someone to write a
large book describing the language found in the wild, or do you
want an IAL with a simple and complete definition?

P.S. I mean Sweet's "New English Grammar".

Perhaps you are right.  But is what Bodman says true?  Isn't it
just denial?  Aren't the affixes alive and well?  When he says an
affix sticks firmly he presumably don't mean that that affix is
never found molesting another root, but that neither root ever
consorts with another affix, nor appears in public naked.  Is that
really true?

Glosa claims to be a global IAL. As such it must meet some criteria,
it's own and those of its potential users. Seems to me that Glosa
is not true to its own principles, thus the problem. The result
is that nobody can actually write in it without extreme difficulty.

I see no reason to design a new language. The international language
(European style) aleady exists. Glosa barely qualifies as a dialect.
Novial, Occidental, and both Interlinguas are the prime examples.
People can speak any combination of these and be mutually understood.
With somewhat careful selection of vocabulary, they can be adapted
to speaking with native Euro-language speakers who have not even
studied any interlingue or even heard tale of such.

Glosa is not defensible in its current state, it needs redesign work.
I push for: 1) Identify what Glosa's principles are; 2) Follow them.
Examination of the extended vocabulary reveals chaos. There are
obvious ways to fix the problems. I will not accept any "Hands-off!"
statements of people who do not actually support and use the language.
I've tried to use it, and now re-affirm that it does not work, as-is.

> Glosa has derivation, the problem is that it's not designed in,

Good points here and about Sweet, and I agree, so I delete them.

I wonder if my last message made it to the list?
Maybe wasn't so unusually interesting as I thought ...
At risk of boredom, here it is again:

------------------------------------------------------

A micro-study ... I did this unix command, and got a list
of 52 Glosa words, which I reformatted a bit below:

cut -f 3 glosatest* | grep -v '[- ]' | grep '.ekt.$' | sort -u

abjekti afekta aspekti aspekto
defekti dejekti delekta detekti dialekta dialekti direkti disekti
efekti ejekti eklekti elekti erekti expekta
genuflekti hekto injekti insekti inspekti
kolekti konekti konfekti korekti
lekto nekto objekti
perfekti perspekto plekto prefekta prefekto projekti
reflekti rejekta rekti respekta respekti retrospekti
sekta sekti selekti spekta subjekti suspekta
tekti tekto vekti vekto

It's a bit of a jungle, but by disentangling it
we can reduce the 52 chaotic words to 11 nice roots:
"fekt jekt lekt nekt rekt sekt tekt vekt flekt plekt spekt".

The prefixes are familiar: "ab ad de dia dis ex in ko per
pre pro re sub super", and some few compounds like "genu".
Then maybe some missing words like "kon-vekt" appear.

Obviously there are many other groups besides "-ect".
(Wouldn't they all sound nicer using Greek "apo-" for "ab-"?)
To reduce G-8000 to manageable size, we selekt/inspekt all
these sets, then look for more patterns among the remainder.
Maybe eliminate "-fika" words with "-fect", or the reverse.

Also apparent is the random final vowel situation.
I would make them all -e for etymological and mnemonic
reasons, but there is more to it ... crypto-suffixes!

It did, and FWIW this is also a Linux system.  Your cut pipe is a
good demo of the power of sh and the Unix utilities.

Your classification of '?ekt' roots appears sound (to a naive
observer).  Keep up the good work.

There's a difference?

The Greeks a pretty good at swallowing vowels.  In practice the
"apo" would be pronounced "ap" in many cases.  So you are arguing
for a voiceless "b" instead of a voiced "b".

Most of the A- vocabulary is either AB- or AD- plus verbal root.
The AD- tends to assimilate nicely and all the IALs allow A=AD.
But AB- is fairly ugly to pronounce, whereas AP(O)- is flexible,
sounds better and has exactly the same meaning. It would make
auto-hyphenation (and thus identification of roots) much easier.
But even a small change like that would rattle cages; even though
Glosa supposedly favors Greek ... It was just a thought.

I do argue for identifying all those hidden roots, and
either a(d)-cept-ing or e(x)-ject-ing the whole lot.

What he is saying is that they cannot be used actively to form new words,
and this is a GOOD thing because their semantic content is so vague that any
new words formed with them, could not be understood as easily as a compound
or phrase formed from words which have a definite meaning.

> the "6000" lexicon should not be altered too drastically.

For me, the description of G6000 in the Glosa Publications list is
instructive.
"6000 Greek and Latin Words and Roots which occur in the Euro-languages and
the International Scientific Terminology"
"Readership:
This dictionary gives the meanings of Greek and Latin roots used in
medicine, biology, plant and animal names etc. Suitable for educationalists,
students, linguists and for Glosa enthusiasts."

This tells me that G6000 has never been intended to be the "heart" of Glosa.
It is just a interesting exercise to demonstrate the "Hogben Principle" that
there is no need to invent an international vocabulary as an excellent one
already exists and has been waiting to be more widely used for at least the
last three centuries (i.e. the Vocabulary of Science).

In contrast the Glosa Publications list gives as the readership for CENTRAL
GLOSA
"Readership:
Ideal for beginners of Glosa, advanced students and teachers of Glosa."

This tells me that G1000 IS the "heart" of Glosa. Hogben's aim was always
for a language for all the world, and so one having the greatest possible
word economy, and a rationally constructed word list that would cover all
the essential words of intercommunication. The language should contain a
judicious selection of general terms and descriptive periphrase for specific
uses.

Ashby and Clark write "The authors consider that the Glosa presented here in
this book (CENTRAL GLOSA) is the most important Glosa....Glosa 1000. By
calling it Central Glosa it is hoped that the reader will never lose sight
of its central importance. If Glosa is to become truly Interglosa, the
International Auxiliary Language, it must remain simple. Comfortable
westerners might quickly get lost in Mega Glosa, forgetting the baser
degrees by which they ascended."
  "We hope that students who might get involved in the seeming luxury of
Mega-Glosa will quickly work up to Central Glosa, which involves clear
thinking."
  "Glosa 1000 is not only capable of great accuracy, but is also capable of
any degree of subtlety."

My understanding of the term "Mega-Glosa" is that it is all rest of the
"international" words that we might want occasionally to use for euphony or
variety. This is said to be a very large vocabulary of words, and clearly
goes beyond those words listed in the G6000 book.

    What do you see as Glosa'a own principles?

    ???  I have seen written Glosa by Ashby and Clark, Gaskell, and
others.  I never inquired whether they thought they had "extreme
difficulty" in writing it, but it certainly seems to me to be eminently
writable.  I am very poor at retaining vocabulary, which is the primary
reason I write very little in *any* conIAL.  Once there is a more
agreed upon selection of central vocabulary, I might give it a try
again.  But apart from a judicious selection of vocabulary from already
existing materials, I see no pressing need to make changes in the
language itself.

    There is no such thing as a "perfect" auxiliary languae: one
person's "necessary feature" is another's "fatal flaw."  If, once
again, Akkadian were to become a widely used auxlang, and if I had
enough need, I would try to use it, Semitic grammar and all.

    In which case, to be honest, it puzzles me as to why you are active

    Oh?  Several years ago I successfully used Glosa with two letters
each way from and to a man in China who said that he knew little (if
any) English (and I know no Chinese language).  It certainly worked
then.

I can't find any. I was once enthusiastic about Hogben's
original ideas, but they were largely jettisoned by A&C.
After a long time I came to like A&C better, and took it
as a naive groping after pidgin/creole. Now it is clear
(from vocabulary) that theyhad no such plan. So, I dunno.

It is an extremely poor English relex, replete with impenetrable
idioms; I tried parsing this one in excruciating detail, once:

But with a proper design, very little learning should be needed
for any European, because we already know all those word-roots
through Greco-Latin derivative words in English; they are even
more transparent to other eurolang speakers. And apparently,
the authors say this version of Glosa is *not* yet "Interglosa",
the global IAL, so this must be the euro-regional version!

Here is how to do the vocab: list prefixes, suffixes, roots.
But please *not* 6000 randomized "word stems", or 27000 as in Ila.
Here are 26 magnificent roots, to be multiplied by 10 prefixes
apiece, times 10 suffixes on the average, yielding 2600 useful
and immediately recognizable words, most of which *are* in Glosa
but *hidden* by the amateurish pseudo-phonetic spelling:

act auct coct dact dict duct fact fect fict flect flict fract frict
ject lect nect pact pict rect sect spect suct tect tract vect vict

But many are missing from Glosa, like "convect". We sense these
lacunae in the vocab but can't find them, because there is no
discernable system to it. So I recommend we impose a rational system,
derived/extracted/analyzed/extrapolated from the existing G-vocab.
According to my reading of the materials, users are justified
and permitted/allowed/encouraged to do exactly that.

> There is no such thing as a "perfect" auxiliary lang

But there are better and worse. Esperanto and Glosa-present are
not even good enough to withstand a stiff breeze (of fresh air).
But at least Glosa is reformable; it has some resources for evolution.
Any language that cannot be evolved is flat-out *dead*.

Occidental did not resist reform, it encouraged it.
Eventually most adherents went over to Gode's dictionary.
But one cannot actually learn a dictionary, one needs a system.
Naturalism is the right path, I am certain, because no other way
will work for most adults, who have *no* time to re-learn vocab;
we must find it already deep within our native languages.
Glosa accepts this pan-euro-vocabulary, but tries to impose
analytic (English) syntax upon it, with *good* results.
Occidental also uses such analyticism, to a lesser degree.

To reform the vocab means making some *changes* to it. I am
highly amused that people whine whenever this is actually attempted!

Me too, but I meant as a real living language, not just a code book.
The international language of Europe must be spoken and heard, not
just talked about or practiced like algebra or crossword-puzzles ...

The source for this is the 1993 book Central Glosa. Unfortunately a typo as
crept in here as the book gives ~face u mero ra~, and also a Greek synonym
~eureka~. "18 Step" in its "English - Glosa 1000" section gives ~inventi~.
As Marcel has pointed out in an earlier post, these "definition
translations" are hard to use in practice.

Inventing is fun.  ?? ~Face u neo ra es hedo.~
Edison invented the electric light bulb.  ?? ~Edison pa face u neo ra, qi es
u elektro foto bulbo.~
Inventor  ?? ~neo-ra face-pe~
a useful invention  ?? ~u funktio ge-neo-face ra~

Re "prescribed terminal vowels" - What makes you think that that is the
case? One of the things we been posting about recently is their variability,
even within the a few page in the same section of a book.

These are from the same 1993 book.
"artificial", as in ~plu ge-face flori~ or ~u ge-face lingua~
"produce" - this is shown as ~u ge-face~, therefore produce in the nominal
sense, as in, ~U ge-face de face-do gene fero per trena.~
"consist", this is another of the "definition translations", perhaps this
can be expanded into, ~U sukro-sito pa gene face ex plu banana e sukro
krema.~

Of course, ~no-~ is used to form opposites in Glosa, where as English "un-"
usually only shows negatives, which is not the same thing. So if ~face~
means "make", the opposite would be "demolish, destroy", and if ~face~ can
mean "do", its opposite would be "undo". "Un-make" as in "un-make a bed" is
surely only ~no-sistema u kli~. "Havoc" = "widespread damage, destruction,
or devastation" and so fits in fine as the opposite of "make".

Scientific vocabulary was Hogben's intent. Also, analytic syntax.
So far, so good ...

This is true, and fantastic. But the implication is that
literate Europeans do not need to learn it, they already know it.
This takes it all out of the hands of language creators!

> G1000 IS the "heart" of Glosa.

G1000 is a set of example words, most unrecognizable.
It is a poor collection of international words or roots.

Simple in syntax, yes. Also the vocab should not need to be
learned as if it were an apriori or artificially-mangled list.

> the term "Mega-Glosa"

Where's the "Micro-Glosa" that people might really use?
Sorry, I'm feeling hyper-critical lately. Glosa needs
reform! Here's my idea for people to shoot at:

1. Determine to what degree a pidgin/creole is desired.
This would be ideal for a global auxlang.
But it's not an all-or-none proposition.

2. Determine to what degree at-sight-recognition is desired.
This is ideal for a regional (euro-) auxlang.
Only a lunatic would start from apriori ... hmm.

3. Now design a grammar in accordance with 1 & 2.
Try it, test it, use it, but don't "defend" it.
Instead, identify weak points, change them, iterate.

4. Provide a usable lexicon. This is where Glosa fails.
But it is correctable.

So, I would start with Glosa as-is, and reform the vocabulary
to use well-defined roots and affixes. I think a list of
500 *recognizable* roots and under 100 affixes and particles
is sufficient for Micro-Glosa. If it really worked at all,
people would be posting in it from day one. New roots would be
suggested and added, unproductive/troublesome ones dropped.

Perhaps this would be an acceptable idea for the list:
People should nominate their own favorite roots and write
short paragraphs *using* them. Then we read and steal
from each other, augmenting our personal dictionaries.
Results might be very surprising.

I wonder if this is not the "Dutton (of Speedwords) Fallacy". The maths look
great but the words don't correspond to any concepts needed in the real
world .

    You could always try resurrecting Interglossa.  Seriously (not
being flippant).  I don't think it ever really got a good trial.  (I
wish I had a copy, even though on a quick perusal I found the style
rather dense.)

    I think this is an artifact of the users, not of the language
itself.  For example, some native English speakers just cannot seem to
break themselves of the habit of always marking verbs for tense or
nouns for number, but that habit is certainly not the fault of Glosa. 
Importing impenetrable idioms is also sloppiness on the part of users,
not built into the language itself.  If I try to import English idioms
into French, it is certainly not the fault of the French language if
people in Montreal or Lyons have trouble understanding me.

    But if Glosa is to be a global IAL, as some poeple might wish, then
a lot of those Greco-Latin words are not going to be very familiar to
other than "eurolang speakers."  Your position seems to be rather
heavily weighted in favor of native speakers of what Leo Moser has
called the WENSA languages.  If all you want is an IAL for WENSAns,
well, then Occidental or Interlingua would probably serve adequately.

    Shades of Esperanto with its conglomerated words!

    Even this may be a matter of opinion and familiarity as to which
language is "better" and which is "worse."  And in the end linguistic
characteristics are not going to be the primary determinant of whether
an auxiliary language comes into widespread use or not.

    Oh, I don't know.  Esperanto has lasted for 113 years and has quite
a few periodicals and published works, with probably at present more
users than all other conIALs put together.  Like it or not -- and I
don't particularly -- Esperanto certainly works for the purposes to
which its speakers put it, and I doubt that it is going to disappear
from the conIAL scene anytime soon.

> But at least Glosa is reformable; it has some resources for evolution.
> Any language that cannot be evolved is flat-out *dead*.

    Evolution or change of fiat by people who don't happen to like this
feature or that?  IALdom is replete with the corpses of language
projects by people who thought they could do a better job.  No
constructed auxiliary language is ever going to be able to satisfy
everybody in all its features.

> Occidental did not resist reform, it encouraged it.

    Ask Bob Petry about reforming Occidental by those who are not
already active supporters and users of it.

    Such as the Gode and Blair Interlingua Grammar.  Interlingua
certainly works.  It is used constantly on the interlng mailing list.

    So monoglot adult speakers of Mandarin, Turkish, Aymara, and Tamil
will not have to relearn vocabulary for your European-based IAL?  Or
are you not targeting them?  Again, if all you want is an IAL for
WENSAns, I suggest sticking to Occ or Ia.

    Or maybe, rather than whining, they are really asserting that all
that needs to be done is select more judiciously from already existing
materials.  People are not whining just because they disagree with you.

Once again I must call you to account on your
post Catty. Bob P. is resisting reform of Occi.
Just check out occidental{at}egroups{dot}com{dot} Please
get your facts straight. Most adherents of Occi
didn't go over to a dictionary. They did adapt
to the more scientifically derived spellings used
by the IED, but they also adopted the more 
neutral and better suited grammar found in 
Gode/Blair's "A Grammar of the International
Language". Put yourself in their shoes... if you
had to would you choose... "strax" or "rapide",
"flicca" or "puera". If you chose the more
international form you'd be adapting to and
accepting the Interlingua form. 

The latinicity of a lot of Internationally shared
words in the languages of Western nations is
a strength of languages like Interlingua and
Glosa. This I know you wouldn't disagree
with, otherwise you'd be showing your 
prejudice for a language in which one's 
whims cause vocabulary choices that are
not international, such as "flicca" and "strax".

In my opinion Glosa is a simplified form 
of that shared vocabulary. Much like Basic
English is a simplified form of Standard
English.

If you can't understand this then perhaps
this is the reason for a lot of your criticism
of Glosa.

Since,
Jay B.

Yes, I've done the same. It is certainly very far from Hogben's rigidly
fixed syntax, and imposible to devise a neat set of simple rules from. But
is it "replete with impenetrable idioms"? I have seen some "shocking"
anglicisms from time to time, but it is not unusual for second language use
to be infuenced by your first language.

Re "Relexing" - Robin has said more than once that Glosa translates word for
word into English, but English cannot be translated word for word into
Glosa. If you look at your Glosa quote above, and compare it to the English
original -

"it may seem" becomes ~posi id feno~
"that" becomes ~qi~
"cover"  becomes ~sati~
"essential words" becomes ~nece volu~
"yet" becomes ~sed~
"say" becomes ~posi~
"assumes aquaintance with" becomes ~uti~
"perhaps" becomes ~minimo~
"some" becomes ~proxi~
"It requires no lengthy scrutiny" becomes ~Pe ne nece stude id mega tem~
"material" become ~lista~

This seems to suggest that meaning is being translated, not words.

http://rick.harrison.net/langlab/i0.html

I agree, but I no longer believe Greek is useful in an IAL
except for the scientific combining-forms/prefixes;
as a base, it only conflicts with superior Latin roots.
Its adjective-noun hyphenation order (PROTO-PLANET) is
very English and nice, but A&C do not use it consistently.

> Importing impenetrable idioms is also sloppiness on the part of users,

I tried to re-phrase those idioms myself but could not,
because one really needs a few clear participles or verbal-nouns
or *something* like grammatical affixes, which Glosa has few of.
I would be willing to try a pure pidgin/creole style for a
global IAL, but currently Glosa does not really claim to do that ...

Yes. I and some other auxlang people have dreamed of a global IAL,
but it seems unattainable. Glosa certainly has no claim to a
powerful derivational system, which is needed for an IAL.
Bahasa Indonesia is light-years ahead, and used by 100 million
people, in everyday life ... today already! A&C speak of "Mega-Glosa"
the way I speak of playing centerfield for the New York Yankees.

> Shades of Esperanto with its conglomerated words!

Not *that* bad ... the Romans were very practical people.
They (de- re- etc + lect flect etc) are equivalent to English
phrasal verbs, but fully international. Not a philosophical
ideal, I grant readily. But you can *remember* the entire
vocabulary rather than *memorize* it.

Bob is great, but majority rules. I happen to mostly agree
with him, and much prefer the Occidental of De Wahl to the
gutted stinking fish of Ric Berger's Interlingue. But I am
saying much the same thing about Occidental as Glosa: use those
super-productive practical Roman verb roots that everybody
already knows, and obtain true at-sight comprehension.
I have sanction for this from the authors of both languages,
because they have included those forms. You would need to
anti-reform (de-struct) Glosa to remove them, actually.

Turkish, Arabic, Putongua, Hindi. It is only the sad Europeans
who do *not* have an IAL!!!!!!!! Of course I do think it is
nonsense to think of a global IAL before a regional European.
The authors themselves put global Interglosa in the future.

You appear to be thinking of naturalism as the alternative to
apriorism.  To me it is the alternative to autonomy, to complete
definition.  It has very little to do with whether words have come
out of Europe or out of a machine.

I am perplexed by the enduring attraction of naturalism.  It seems
so obviously mistaken, at least as it applies to word derivation,
and a refusal to fully define the language.  What's wrong with
defining it?

Naturalism means that people from non-European linguistic groups
don't only have to learn the vocabulary.  That is hard work if the
words are all alien, but at least they are there in the
dictionary.

But naturalism, I think, means that they must somehow acquire
linguistic practices that are nowhere defined and are not capable
of simple definition.  I just don't understand it.  Naturalism
turns its back on a world interlanguage, aiming only for a
regional one.  And for what?  I just can't see the decisive
benefit which would justify such an extreme trade-off.

There is at least one (perhaps only one) autonomous and simple
IAL.  It is almost fully defined, almost totally excludes the
need to infer unstated rules from one's native language.  It only
falls short of absolute autonomy, as far as I can see, in the
existence of a very few French idiomatic phrases, which are,
however, expressly set forth in its 'Complete Manual'.

What is the matter with such a language?  Why not just learn it,
and move on?  What on earth is the attraction of naturalism?  Why
the die-hard supporters of a concept that as far as I can see
hasn't got a feather to fly with?  Is this science?

>     So monoglot adult speakers of Mandarin, Turkish, Aymara, and Tamil

The question of learning or re-learning vocabulary is an insoluble
one.  There is nothing for it but to do it.  But at least there is
the dictionary.  Everything is defined, you know what you know and
what you don't, and in the latter case you know what to do about
it.

This is where the minimal vocabulary theories, the Basic English
stuff, can make a contribution.  The selection of the core
vocabulary, the first thousand or so words, is very important.  
The insistence on simple language, the refusal to import into the
language words meeting every subtlety of meaning, is also very
important.

But we get nowhere criticising the West European or WENSA
provenance of the words.  They have to come from somewhere.  If
they were taken in a democratic and even-handed way from every
language of the world, or if they were generated a priori, they'd
be difficult for everyone.  To make them easy for some is not a
crime.  

If you would prefer them to be easy for someone ELSE, show me all
the Hindi-based and Cantonese-based IALs.  There was nothing to
stop people from designing them.  India has about 12 major
languages, surely a fertile field out of which the IAL concept
could have arisen.  But the fact is that the concept and the
implementations have come out of Europe.

I'm sorry this is so off-topic.  Let's get back to Glosa.

Of course they do.  The whole world does.  It has English, a
grammatically rather simple language.  It is at least on a par
with those you mentioned.  And Hindi does not seem to have huge
penetration, even in India, nor, AFAIK, is it a good candidate.  
Why do you call it an IAL?

But I didn't think this was about natural languages that had made
it as international languages.  They are usable, but almost never
used well, by non-native speakers.  I think another of Bodman's
gems is that English is the easiest language in the world to learn
to the level of simple communication.

From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 16 Sep 2000 19:42:52 -0700


I was looking at this bit by Edgar De Wahl, written
in the constantly evolving Occidental of 1925.
It is no-way pidgin, neither is it unusually
sophisticated in sentence structure:

: Li ver economie ne consiste
: in payar vili precies a reciver brac e desvaloralia,
: ma in acquisition del max bon e durabil materie o instrumente
: quel posse persister in omni occasiones.

So here I have tried to translate into Glosa,
using only *attested* vocabulary:

: U veri economi ne konsiste
: in paga vili preci a gene brakte e no-valu kosa,
: sed in aqire de maxi boni e dura materia alo ru
: qi posi tenacio in omni okasio.

The words "economy consist tenacious/persist occasion"
are all official Glosa, not compounds of my devising.
The words "u alo ru qi" are the sorest thumbs, IMO.
But even the recognizable latinate words suffer from
lack of appropriate endings so the syntax is vague.
Probably needs more particles. But I'm tired already;
every latinate word has unpredictable spelling,
so each word must be looked-up. Oddly, only "persist"
seemed to be missing, though "receive" has only
"gain" as an equivalent, qi es ne boni. Like Ila,
Glosa tethers the user to the dictionary.

One wants a high degree of naturalism, but also of regularity.

For a well-defined language, Lojban; but it is absurd.
Ido is not so regular as one might think, though it tried ...
Ido "naturalized" Esperanto's vocabulary (made the roots more
recognizable) but the affixes are apriori and not rigorous.
Occidental merely naturalized/regularized the affixes.
Glosa has very little use for suffixes; does it work?

> What is the matter with such a language?  Why not just learn it,
> and move on?  What on earth is the attraction of naturalism?

One doesn't have to learn it, only recognize it.
It is minimal effort for maximal results.
A sphere has the highest volume per surface-area ratio.
Glosa can/must/does use these "international words",
but it needs more regularity.

> The question of learning or re-learning vocabulary is an insoluble
> one.  There is nothing for it but to do it.

Skip that step, we already know the words.
Think of English words with -ion or -ive or -able.
They are usually latinate. They are international.
You can use them with people who speak no English.
And they form big beautiful word-families, which
one can study in a mass rather than individually.

> The selection of the core
> vocabulary, the first thousand or so words, is very important.

Exactly: re- de- con- etc. -LECT- -FECT- etc.
100 of these are worth 10,000 of the other type.

> The insistence on simple language, the refusal to import into the

No good, adults need real adult language. The latinate
words embedded within all eurolangs form a full vocabulary.
Language teachers have us convinced we need to invest years,
when a single weekend will do.

> if they were generated a priori, they'd
> be difficult for everyone.  To make them easy for some is not a

Exactimen.

And embedded within the Glosa-8564 we find also those
latinate super-productive internationally-known words.
They just need some polishing and a spotlight.
And then, maybe a few nice regular+natural suffixes ...
Let's take the best from Ido (regular word-composition)
and try to find that in Glosa; prefixes are already done.

In your dreams Catty...  
Learn the words and use them. 
The text in Occi you quoted I 
could write in I-gua without much 
change or "looking up" ... which
if you can use Occi without
looking up then what's your
beef with Interlingua? Frankly,
your statements are flawed. 
Since Occi and Interlingua
share almost 95% of the 
vocabulary, as per Bob P.
your pal, it stands to reason
that you wouldn't be looking
up a lot if you already know
Occidental. 

But I rather think that it is
out of your biggoted dislike
of Interlingua that you state
non-truths like the one above.

If you learn the Glosa vocab
then you would have no need
to constantly look things up.

That you do not wish to, says
volumes about your attitude 
and your bringing up Occi
at every occasion possible.

Learn the languge, man, then
complain about it. You seem
to complain about what you 
do not understand. Ignorance
is no base on which to stand.

How lame Catty! 

I am a language teacher, and a single 
weekend just wont do. You need to
learn and practice a language. Both go
hand in hand, learning and practicing
you can't have one without the other.

That the volume of shared International
roots can be found out in a weekend is
simply misinformed and at worst a lie.
You've been reading too much of Bob
P.'s propaganda, I think.

Give Glosa more than a weekend and
then tell me about it. Otherwise stick
to your Occi, which from what samples
I've read you can't even use properly,
and how many weekends did that take
you? You need more practice, bud.

Maybe so, but it sounds as if you had far too many beans

No, you got it all wrong, Catty. Glosa 1000 is a base
vocab for communication and practice. The Glosa 1000
helps the user to become acquainted with the mechanics
of the language. This is the means of learning a language
which infants use. Learn a pattern, practice a pattern, use
the pattern to form and communicate original thoughts.

What you are talking about in your last paragraph is
creating your own project... maybe it would be called
Cat-glosa, or maybe Auli-catty... Maybe you could
call Bob P. up and get his opinion, he's pretty good
at renaming things.

To be brief, I'll respond on this only.  Simple does not mean
childish.  Charles Dickens wrote a number of books in which people
agree to meet, in the street and elsewhere, but inexplicably he
always (I think) avoided the word "rendevous".  If I'm not
mistaken, Thomas Hardy is another good example, and I expect that
many accomplished authors would fit the pattern.  Simple writing
is forceful.  They say the Bible has a small vocabulary, yet it
deals with a great variety of public and private life.  Again
there is life in the street, there are meetings, and troops
assemble, but never rendevous.

The best writing is simple and direct, but people, those of not
the highest linguistic endowment, i.e. very, very many people, are
perpetually attracted to redundant coinings which can become
fashionable.  They seem essential, because they are exactly of the
context and the time, but they are totally unnecessary.

There are also redundant pairs, such as 'ox' and 'beef', 'sheep'
and 'mutton', that seem essential to English speakers, yet result
from a non-linguistic cause, an accident of history.

If we don't carefully exclude what is really inessential, what is
redundant, we insupportably increase the vocabulary of the
language.

Of course there is much of the world of the last 1000 years, and
of modern technology, that is not encompassed by the vocabulary of
the Bible.  We need new words, but we must be discriminating, not
admit what is inessential.  Our test should be severe.

    Unfortunately the appearance of indiscipline comes from the
Glosa-Central attitude to learner usage.  I prefer to 'correct' people's
usage, when I meet irregular usage, but do not always do so.  The worry for
Ron and Wendy, in the absence of a printed grammar book, was to avoid
upsetting neophytes with tedious corrections. 
    By writing the Seminars #1 and #2, I attempted to help with
standardisation of Glosa usage: I'm not sure if this was an attempt to
discipline the language or the users.
    I guess that this conundrum is a major stumbling block in a language
that lacks morphological grammar, and which depends, for its regularity, on
the innate language sense of the utterers.

    At the time I was getting frustrated with Glosa (~1984 - 1990), it was
because of a string of changes to the language.  About 1992, I thought that
the language had been standardised, and had reached its final edition. Then
I prepared the seminars at the request of some Ugandans, who wanted more
guidance in the use of the language.  
    After that, I tried to tabulate the grammar, and sought to extract an
'English --> Glosa' version of the "Glosa 6000" list: it was about this
time that I became aware more work was necessary.
    Now, again, Charles is getting frustrated with the language, but this
time, because it is not changing, and it ought to be.

    After Olympic Madness has departed from Sydney, I must concentrate hard
on these present questions.

Saluta,
   Robin

*   While I can agree with Charles' desire for a "good" standardisation
between Classical source and latter-day Glosa, I feel that, taking the
sophistication of Civilisation into account, we cannot always go back to
the purity of using the exact forms of the Classical roots in Glosa.

    The Classical world was fairly meagre, when it came to concepts - by
contrast with our modern technological Civilisation.  So, I fear this
historical development requires us to ^fill in some of the cracks^ between
the basic Greek and Latin roots.

    Regarding CEDE and CESA I could make out a case for saying that 'moving
ones position' and 'stopping' are ^two sides of the one coin^.  Hence,
right from the start, these two concepts could have been intertwined and
even used interchangably.

>cede                         cesa                 recense

   I can imagine seeing the bottles moving .. and stopping .. on the
assembly line.  This would allow for the *forward movement* and continual
*stopping* as the contents were squirted into the bottle during the filling 
"process" (PRO - CESA).

*   I might say it a little differently.  By understanding the etymology of
English - and of Interglossa and Glosa - a person develops a better 'feel'
for the language and a better understanduing of the essence of the words.
    I guess that Hogben did assume that he was speaking to an educated
audience, which was aware of the source roots of the technology lexicon.
    However, Ron Clark used to suggest that learning Glosa was an excellent
introduction to the English language, often introducing to learners, for
the first time, the roots inherent in English.

    I believe that learning about the etymology of language gives us a much
better understanding of the nature of language.  Had George W. Bush taken
time off to understand the source of the words he uses, he would not now be
voicing the tremendous gaffs he is making on National, US television, such
as saying "preverse" instead of "perverse", or in describing hidden
messages as "subliminable."

Oh, I disagree ... Nothing is new under the sun.
America is the modern Rome, and English phrasal verbs
are directly parallel with Latin, but non-international.

>     Regarding CEDE and CESA I could make out a case for saying that 'moving

Indeed, but more like multi-sided dice ... recede recess,
procede process, precede precess, concede (= concess), accede access,
(ab-cede?) abcess, (in-cede?) incess(ant) ... and so on!
This is the Glosa core vocabulary, and the core international vocab.

Taking words in their proper forms, they are 100% regular and easy.
The CEDE/CESA words point the way to re-organizing the Glosa-8000
into a few hundred core root-concepts that generate word families.
This solves the problem of having too many unrelated words,
without throwing-out, e-ject-ing, or a-bol-ishing any.

Agreed, an IAL must *not* be simple as in "makeshift pidgin jargon",
but *must* be simple as in "direct and powerful but easy to learn".
These are not contradictory in a well-designed IAL.
The heart of an IAL is not a vocab list, which must evolve,
but rather its principles, which need to remain consistent.
Any IAL must use the international word roots and affixes.
If we keep returning to this base concept, we cannot go wrong.

Right, those small non-international words must be excluded,
whereas BOV- and VAC- are international and form many useful
derivatives. It is not so easy to do this properly, though ...
"vaccinate, vaccine" comes originally from "vacca = cow",
but "bovine = cow" is now used internationally for the animal.

Thanks, for dating your messages so far in the past

Please continue that way. BTW, how many of the

Do you still mix everything with your native

Sorry, but I won't hear your replies.
You harassed me on every public mailing list,

I'm not abandoning this list, though.
Keep reading my posts and learn something,

And please, resume your medicine; it's that

    I must demur here.  There are those who assert that there is a
deep structure, or some such thing, to grammar.  I will not address
that point, as I think it is unnecessary here.  I fear that what Robin
is referring to here as "the innate language sense of the the utterers"
is no more than native language conditioning, and that varies all over
the map all over the world.  We must be very, very, very, very, very
careful not to confuse what seems "natural" to us, due to our own
language conditioning, with what seems "natural" to everybody.  That is
why I think that, didactically, a language with almost no grammatical
morphology such as Glosa needs to have its syntactic structures
effectively specified, if not formally then by a comprehensive set of
not only paradigmatic sentences but also paradigmatic connected texts.

    But what is the nature of this "powerful derivational system" that
you claim an IAL needs?  What about Tok Pisin?  Grass belong head =
hair.  Grass belong face = beard.  Is this a powerful enough
derivational system, or does it count only if it is morphological with
affixes and mutating roots, as is so with many, many latinate word
series?

    Latin itself did not have nearly the size of vocabulary that
English does.  (Few languages did/do.)  Does that mean that Latin
was/is (it's still alive) not a "real adult language"?  I agree 
with the sentence you quoted.

Tok Pisin works just fine, and I posted a good URL about that.
If there were a similar system in Glosa (head-last compounding),
then it would be more like a pidgin-creole and very interesting
as a global IAL. I once thought that was the intent, but now
it seems less likely ... Wendy may/should clarify that;
one could well argue that Marcel's G-5000 supports it.
Still the latinate prefixes would remain, and they do fit
the TP pattern (but reverse of English verb+adverb) nicely.
Or possibly Glosa would go the suffixation route. I dunno.

They say that Latin and Greek derivational systems could easily
handle any challenge one could present to them; even tele-vision ...
English incorporates many different roots for similar concepts,
where L & G used affixes to "nuance" the relatively few roots.
English turned out more "regular" but L & G more "systematic",
(at least in some senses, as we are probably all aware by now).
Our international language must combine their strengths,
but carefully avoid their weaknesses.

I am looking at the verbs first, because there is a large set
of very useful and mnemonically related international roots,
LECT etc, easily combinable with the prepositions CO- etc.
>From verbs one derives agents, results, states, etc.
So one word expands into 100 ... With just a few of those,
we can generate a huge at-sight-recognizable vocab in hours.
Those words are all to be found hiding within the Glosa vocab.
They are the true core learner vocab.

Haaahhhh !!!
Youre welcome Catty.
No, I'm not on any meds, and not on
any bi-polar cycles. Just annoyed by
your constant references to how much
better Occidental is... "Oh, Occi is just
sooooo much better" "Ohhhh I can't
believe Glosa's derivational system,
Ohhhhh me, ohh my"

Give me a pregnant break pal!

Look, Glosa works, Glosa is not
perfect. Neither are you, nor am I
nor are the authors of Glosa, nor
your beloved Occi idols, nor any
human being on this planet. That
you constantly highlight the glories
of Occidental on this list is quite
annoying, specially since Interlingua
is by far more developped and better
thought out than Occidental. Glosa
on the other hand does not have the
same scope nor function as Interlingua.
It is a language for global communication.
Something Interlingua does not nor has
ever claimed to be. Interlingua is an at-sight
recognizable system for use among people
who are acquainted with the source languages,
or who are interested in learning a simple
system that can help bridge them over to
understanding the base languages used
to derive Interlingua.

Glosa on the other hand is a means of
communication by which simple roots
have been decided upon to serve as
building blocks in creating a simple
yet workable language whereby people
of different langauges can communicate.
Glosa uses Greek and Latin roots to form
its building blocks. But more than this
it uses simple patterns of forming sentences
and avoids complicated derivational systems
and stays away from the schematic feel of
IALs like Esperanto and Ido.

Occidental is just a lesser Interlingua as
far as I'm concerned, and needs a lot more
tweaking than Glosa.

Now go put that in your peace pipe or
wherever else you wish, and please note
the correct date has been well attended to
on your account... May it do wonders
for your self-esteem to be so sharp eyed.

Since,
Jay B.

Well, you keep going wrong time and again,
Catty. What's wrong with pidgins and jargon.
Lingua Franca of the Levant lived for centuries
and was used by many to communicate across
barriers. Now what's more important to have
traders understand one another or to have some
logically derived or contrived grammar. ???

No, no y no! There's nothing wrong with Glosa
having simple word formations. There's nothing
wrong with simple languages. Koine Greek was
more important to the daily lives of people 2000
years ago than Philosophical Greek ever was. 
Hebrew was a shepherds language, or so it has
been called, and yet God Himself thought it good
to have the first books of the Bible written in it.
Go figure, eh? Maybe you know better... Hah!

All this tweaking and perfectionist hi-falootin 
is just a lot of tootin. Akin to Government speak.
In my opinion. Keep it simple and keep it sweet...
you know how the rest goes...

Jay B.

Trolling for more crypto-affixes ...

avantage bagage barage biberage boskage
foliage fuselage kamuflage
masage mesage paisage pasage vilage voltage

Several have the usual meaning of -age but with a
horrible mis-phoneticized kako-pronunciagion.
Image asking someone seriously about volt-agg-eh?
I propose changing all these for root + "JE",
a new and improved, more Glosa-style genune suffix.
It can then be applied to many hundreds of roots,
in the internationally familiar manner.

Same for "-TIO". OK, here they are roughly, unix command:

I have finally looked at Marcel's list of "missing" words,
present in the English common-word lists and not in Glosa,
but I disagree that they are really missing:

absence    ... ABSENTIA
acceptable ... ACEPTABILI
accordance ... AKORDANTIA
accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

Should all the derivatives be listed in the dictionary?
Peano and De Wahl and Jesperson all used a compressed
list format, indicating derivatives sorta like:

A-CEPT -a, -ant(e), --ia, -abili

I think they should be written out more fully,
but listed together in proper word-families,
which makes study 1000 times easier:

-CEPT-
	acept-, koncept-, recept- ...
	-ceptabili -ception -ceptive -ceptentie

-LECT-
	...
	...

-MAN-
	...
	...

Or maybe each prefix-ed form requires a separate line,
because the meanings are not entirely apparent;
and maybe the suffixed forms too:

-CEPT-
koncept-
recept-
...
-ceptabili
-ception
...

But we need cannot list all the combined forms separately,
there are far too many: reception, acceptable, ... ad inf.
And it seems to me that most if not all international words
are inherently part of Glosa, whether listed anywhere or not.
Of course it's good evidence if the root is attested somewhere ...

Thank you Charles for reading the list
(www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidmiss.htm ).  Sorry, the list is messy,
because I was too lazy to write comments to every word.  The list
shows important English words that are not in (my suggestion of a)
"Core"-dictionary.  I found it necessary to protocol them.


 > but I disagree that they are really missing: ...

Me too.


 > absence    ... ABSENTIA

"ABSENTIA" does not satisfy me, when we take "AB" for "absent".
That would mean, that the English words (natural language)
absent/absence are closer together than the Glosa words ab/absentia.
I think, it was Paul who wrote: English is the world language to beat.
(Perhaps "AB-TEM", "AB-LO", "AB-STATUS" or courageous "U AB"?)


 > acceptable ... ACEPTABILI
 > accordance ... AKORDANTIA

"CEPTI" is Glosa1000, prefered for "accept".  So "CEPTI-ABILI".  Maybe
"CEPTI" is enough?
Maybe "AKORDA"/"U AKORDA" is enough?  Or "HARMONI"?


 > accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

"accurate" is given in the Internet Dictionary with "exakti 1++".
"accuracy" is missing.  "EXAKTI MODE" is a good idea.  That is what I
thought of.  In this way we could complete the list.


All word creations or modifications I made are marked with "*" and
are explained in www.tuhh.de/~smms1406/gidhist.txt.gz .  Mainly I
tried to avoid inconsistencies.
Your "ABSENTIA", "ACEPTABILI" and "AKORDANTIA" are not in the Glosa
Internet Dictionary yet.
I do not think that it is Glosa what you are doing there, it is more
Ido or Volapük.  I understood it like this:

- Glosa does not prefix/affix/suffixfixfix (although I confess, that
  you showed succesfully, that some Glosa-6000s look so).  Perhaps a
  weak point.

- But: Glosa can build new words with the existing words, connecting
  them with hyphens.  That is powerful.

Posi Glosperido/Occideglossa (tu verba) es u fu lingua.  Sed na ne

  [Maybe Glosperido/Occideglossa (your words) is the language of
  future. But it is not available yet. ]

AB is simply the prefix known in all IE languages, "away from",
officially included in Glosa's list of prefixes; ABS is a variant spelling
used in cases like this, where the compound is really AB-ES (essence, ES, to be)
plus -NT (Latin present participle) plus -IA (abstract noun suffix).
English absent/absence are the same word with different part-of-speech.
It is extremely international, therefore indispensible, unfortunately
messy too. We could use "reanalysis = popular etymology" to cheat:
pretend it is AB-SENT = "be or feel sent away from" or something.

> I think, it was Paul who wrote: English is the world language to beat.

English is not a world language in any sense. It is like French 150 years
ago. And the same thing prevents it being an IAL: lousy pronunciation,
despite good spelling of the international words. People who favor
phonetic spelling of English are killing it as an IAL ... fortunately!

> (Perhaps "AB-TEM", "AB-LO", "AB-STATUS" or courageous "U AB"?)

It's just no good to ignore the international vocabulary.
ABSENT/ABSENCE is PRESENT in every European language.
I have zero interest in any so-called IAL that is effectively apriori.

> "CEPTI" is Glosa1000, prefered for "accept".  So "CEPTI-ABILI".  Maybe
> "CEPTI" is enough?

Not really ... looks like "septic" to me. It is better to leave
the words long enough to be easily recognizeable. What's the hurry
nowadays? People need to slow down and enjoy all the syllables ...

> Maybe "AKORDA"/"U AKORDA" is enough?  Or "HARMONI"?

Both "accept/recept/decept/..." and "accord/discord/record/..."
word families are certainly needed.

>  > accuracy   ... EXAKTI MODE, AKURA MODE

> "accuracy" is missing.

Not a bit: see KURA, the most overused Glosa root of all.
It compounds with AD to make AD-KURA = AKURA.

> Your "ABSENTIA", "ACEPTABILI" and "AKORDANTIA" are not in the Glosa
> Internet Dictionary yet.

They are inherent in Glosa, according to the sources.
You can't eliminate the prefixed words, and shouldn't want to.
Furthermore, ABILI is given in a hundres places as a suffix.
I have shown that -IA and -IO and others are also suffixes.

> I do not think that it is Glosa what you are doing there, it is more
> Ido or Volapük.

No. Please do not accuse me of making a new language project.
That is the filth from lunatic Jay Bowks, who has entered every
IAL discussion group only to sow discord and promote his favorite,
which is certainly not Glosa. I do not want any new IALs.
The only IALs worth considering are those based on the Greco-Latin
international vocabulary, which all can freely mix as dialects.
Within the territories of Ido/Novial, Occidental, and Glosa
can be found all that is necessary for the true IAL.

I have revised my view of Glosa trying to match that of the authors.
It is not a pidgin at all. It is a naive relex of English using
a pocket Italian-English dictionary. Thus it inherited all the
prefixes and suffixes of Greco-Latin. Not my fault!

> - But: Glosa can build new words with the existing words, connecting
>   them with hyphens.  That is powerful.

Simple word compounding is fun but insufficient;
one needs a system. Look at ABILI and KURA in the
materials we just typed ... When I tried translating
word-for-word from Occidental to Glosa I was amazed;
every word but one was in Glosa directly, though in
the messy ABSENTI form you don't like (but I do).

Now *I* am the Glosa conservative, and *you* are the radical
imposing a new vision of pidgin-vocab that the authors
did not clearly intend. You can't throw out the latinate words
and call it Glosa, you dangerous revolutionary!

Joking aside: As we analyze it, clearly Glosa needs some
new clear definitions and directions from Wendy. Should it
become more like the naturalistic IALs, using roots, prefixes
and suffixes? Or should it go pidgin/creole? It doesn't
make much sense as it is right now, halfway between.
If if remains ill-defined and non-systematic, it can't compete
with other IALs. I would like to see it rejuvenated somehow.

I did not want to "accuse" you.  Sorry.  It is just a thing of 
definition.  You would prefer a language between Occidental (and 
others) and Glosa.  I think, this language does not exist and would be 
a new project.  You say it would be no new language, but only a new 
dialect of the existing ones.  Next mail you will see my new :) 
language project.

Prefixes, suffixes and so on or pidgin/creole? 
Good question.  If Glosa would have suffixes, it would get 
part-of-speech-markers (remember: Interglossa had ones!).  And then 
the complete language would come into danger.  ...?  Perhaps "halfway 
between" is gold? 

I just wanted to have a better dictionary, because it was obvious, 
that the previous Internet Dictionary was far apart from the authors's 
publications (except one, namely the book "Glosa 6000"). 

Now I would say, it was quite successful, the dictionary is useful, 
but one problem (vocabulary) cannot be solved without the others 
(e.g.: Prefix/suffix/syllables, system or mess?//  Part-of-speech, yes 
or no?// A lot of important English words are between just an -ing 
form and own "concept", but Glosa has no present participle to imitate 
them.//  And do not forget the ending vowels.).

From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>
Date: Thu, 21 Sep 2000 20:23:05 +0200

For Charles, a "cheap" way to Occideglossa: 

* Occidental uses: -ion, -or, -ori, -iv, -ura, -t. 
* -ion and -ura are close together, I think, not both are necessary. 

* Glosa has the ge- for -t and -pe for -or already.  
* Glosa takes the naked word for -ion, -ori, -iv, -ura.  
* It can form nouns with u/plu and with -ra.  
* -ion is in many Glosa words as -io like petitio, tensio already, 
    but without a meaning! 
* Glosa would allow a combination with -status for -ion. 

Using the existing ge-, -pe, -status, only five new items would 
satisfy you: 
-aktion (a REAL noun from "akti"), -resultat, -(t)ori, -(t)if, and 
maybe -(e)nt for a present participle. 

Put these five into the Core-dictionary, with the remark that they are 
not original and with the advice possibly not to use them, and let the 
language users do what they want. 

I wonder, whether it would help, damage or destroy Glosa.

To "international vocabulary": you charged Jay, 00-09-17: 

 > Do you still mix everything with your native

When we allow all Romanic and Greek words, then a Spaniard speaks 
Spanish and claims to speek Glosa, also the Italian, the Brazilian, 
the French and the Greek.  And all are right!  And I ---- understand 
none of them. 

I remember when I started Latin at school.  The teacher said, nearly 
all Latin words have cognated ones in German.  The first lesson showed 
words like "rosa - Rose (rose)" and "insula - Insel (island)".  It 
seemed, that vocabulary learning would not become a problem.  I 
remember very exactly that later it was not so easy at all!  
Learning only 10 words per day needs discipline, even if the words are 
international.  

==> A vocabulary restriction is necessary.

?  Is Glosa vocabulary strictly limited or is Glosa just "take every
?  Latin/Greek/scientific word you know and use it without grammar"?

?  Have all words to be learned or can some of them be built up by the
?  speaker using a regular system?

I would say: The Glosa authors tried all.  They were not interested so
much in a word building system.  They made "Generic Terms", and that
was it.  That may be too few, but it is better than its final
consequence, a "so-called IAL that is effectively apriori" (I think
best/worst example is Volapük).  I mean "too few" not because of
unsatisfying expressivity of the language, but because of
inconsistencies in the dictionary resulting from a missing system.

They tried a restricted vocabulary (Glosa 1000) and allowed every
other Latin/Greek/scientific (and really Italian!) word simultanously
as "Mega Glosa".

I think their way is possible, but only
- {restricted vocabulary:} if the Core-dictionary has a very high
  quality (well chosen words, only few synonyms, few inconsistencies)
  and is carefully maintained (regularly updated in internet and
  print), but nevertheless stable (not changing too often),
- {Mega vocabulary:} if no language group is dominating,
- {Mega vocabulary:} if the quantity of communication in Glosa is so
  high that a vocabulary is formed automatically by its users.

Well, hmm.

>  > No. Please do not accuse me of making a new language project.

NO!!!!!, not a new language! We have enough right now.
Again: use existing IALs, but do not remain chained to them.

> Prefixes, suffixes and so on or pidgin/creole?

I would prefer P/C but recently it seems incontestable
that the authors imported all the prefixes and many suffixes.
European languages do creolize nicely, and we have no other
example of an IAL of this type. (Lingua Franca Nova has
almost nothing in common with the real LF.)

> If Glosa would have suffixes, it would get
> part-of-speech-markers (remember: Interglossa had ones!).

No, p.o.s. markers are superfluous, and that is why linguists
laugh at Esperanto and Ido. Real languages have a set of affixes
that inherently define p.o.s., e.g. in "electr-ic, terrif-ic"
the -IC is *an* adjectival suffix, not the *only* one.

But if Glosa were to eliminate all euro-suffixes, their
functions would be transferred to prefixed compounds.
De Wahl suggested that will eventually happen in eurolangs.
So, why not a Glosa that accelerates this development?

> And then the complete language would come into danger.  ...?
> Perhaps "halfway between" is gold?

Try using it! If it remains halfway, and is used, something good
might happen. But I doubt it. Currently, I can't stop amid each
sentence to convert a natural -IC suffix to a compound.

> Now I would say, it was quite successful, the dictionary is useful,

Yes, the first real accomplishment I've seen here. Kudos!

Because they used the non-international words. They are therefore wrong.

> international.  

There is no time for adults to learn a second language
that way. The words must be known to them within their
native language. And they are! In one weekend you teach
how to recognize the international words they already know.
Vocabulary is then a solved problem.

> ==> A vocabulary restriction is necessary.

But impossible. Tomorrow a new international word is born.
Everybody uses it except adherents of some religious IAL.

An IAL is *not* a language for children, and should not be
taught in schools; only the great cultural languages should be.
An IAL is for *adults*, who already have well-learned their native lang.
It would be a disaster, a culture-cide, a fanatical vandalism,
to attempt to replace our natural languages with any IAL.

> I would say: The Glosa authors tried all.

Yes, and improved Interglossa greatly, with interesting results.
It just isn't ready as an IAL, without an additional huge input
from the user's imagination. It needs more work, and could be fixed
in several different ways. The remaining author must give the direction.

> inconsistencies in the dictionary resulting from a missing system.

No dictionary can hold all the words of any language,
there must be a system. Every natural lang has such a system,
but lacks sufficient regularity to be easily learned.

Oh. Well, something more has to be done now, because it's a mess.

I only feel justified in using what is *already* present in Glosa.
The Euro-Glossa exists in those crypto-suffixes. For a more interesting
Creolo-Glosa: All the cryptosuffixes are ejected, along with the ugly
apriori -po -bo set. Only word-compounding is allowed:

Occ:    Crypto:      Creolo:      English:
====    ========     =======      ===========================
-ion    -tio         -akti        deverbal abstract noun, action
-or     -ero, -ra?   -homi, -uti  deverbal agentive noun
-ori    -ori         sista-?      deverbal adj., consistent with
-iv     -i, -ivi     pote-        deverbal adj., able/likely to
-ura    -ura, -ur-   -resulta?    deverbal concrete noun, result
-t      -t-, -d-?    fini-        participle, past/passive
-nt     -nt-, -nd-?  dura-        participle, present/active

This is good legal effective official Glosa, actually,
both the Crypto and Creolo columns are in the dictionary.
Only a radical reform-purge-inquisition can remove them!

I know I could use Crypto, because I did already in my experiment
several days ago. Crypto looks like all the other interlingues
and mixes well, i.e. is comprehensible without study. Only the
agentive nouns are a problem, and could be fixed somehow.
But the world has no need for Crypto-Glosa when better IALs exist.

Creolo is the truer spirit of Interglossa/Glosa, IMO.
And I know it would work, because other P/C langs do.
Over time the 3-syllabic compounders would be simplified,
as happened rapidly with the Chinook Jargon. My ideal for
Glosa would be all bi-syllabic roots and no affixes,
all roots compoundable in a systematic and productive way.
Until last month I thought the authors intended such, and
simply had not finished cleaning up the mess. I wish they
(Wendy) would direct us and others to perfect Creolo-Glosa.

Wendy and Ron prefered "xanto" without any doubt.  And so it is 
prefered in the Internet Dictionary now (Bill prefered "flavo" 
before.).  Other words are more tricky because they are both in 
Glosa-1000 and have compounds there (e.g. bio/vive). 

G6000-English says for "luteo" "yellow, brownish" ("brownish" is 
missing in the Internet Dictionary.  I have to put it in for the next 
update!) and for "helvo" "pale yellow".  My Latin dictionary gives for 
"flaveo" gold-yellow.  "safro" is from saffron.  Saffron is very 
expensive, unfortunately I have none in the kitchen, but I remember, 
it was a bit more red-yellow. 

For "xanto" Central-Glosa gives as cognated international word 
"xanto-phyll" and as etymological note: 
  "XANTO-PHYLL G yellow-leaf.  Xantophyll is a yellow pigment in green 
  leaves usually concesled by the intense CHLOROPHYLL. It becomes 
  evident in autumn." 
(Ci, in Hamburg, tu nu pote vide multi xanto folia.  Po frigi 
termo-tem mi pre-nu habe sperma-tem.) 


 > "x" eqa "ks" so "xanto" posi esce "kasanto". 

I like the X, because it is striking by listening and reading because 
it is so rare.  A colour and you hear only ks --> you know instantly 
it is yellow.  It sounds Greek and I like Greek. 

Please no "kasanto".  If you do not like "x", you can speak "s".  
(Cf. book "Glosa 6000", p. 17:) 
  "One or two Greek words start off with awkward-looking pairs of 
  consonants as in psychology.  It is preferable to pronounce the p, 
  but not essential, and can be at individual discretion. "

*   Friends,
    Nice to hear Jay's comments.  Yes, I'd say the Glosa authors were
trying to have it both ways: they made Glosa creole-like with a simply
derived vocabulary, and then they planned for it to be easy to learn with
virtually no morphological grammar.
    The 'Head Final' SVO sentence structure seems to be working quite well,
with the only deficiency worrying me being the lack of further "semantic",
hyphenated suffixes.  This refers to the "generic terms". Allowing only
eigteen two-letter, abbreviated semantic suffixes does seem too few for
civilised conversation; Paul Bartlett mentioned this some time ago,
forshadowing the possible introduction of more , and probably longer,
semantic affixes.  And these have sneaked into Glosa with
~-abili~, ~-ismo~, ~logi~, etc.  However, Paul dislikes the hyphen, because
it has no sound attached, and cannot be pronounced: my belief is that the
hyphen separates discrete words and word abbrevitions, and  assists the
reader etymologically and the computer, symbolically .. while preventing
the pronunciations of the elements of a compound from interfering with
one-another.

   We probably need some more "generic terms."

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*   So, I appreciate Jay's giving me this opportunity to re-inforce a
difference between Glosa and some of the other Interlanguages.

    Glosa was perceived of as a whole language, in itself.  The idea being
that, as well as having the qualities listed, in the paragraph above, it
was presented to be a "comprehensive" language, with a life of its own.
    During the time that I was 'retelling', not 'translating', _The Three
Bears_, I got a shock when I reached the stage that, instead of stumbling
to make Glosa work, I found that the language, itself, was carrying me
along.  On reflection, I realised that I was no longer breathing life into
Glosa, but, instead, it was running ahead of me and inspiring my thoughts.
 
    I had expected to take much longer, to reach such a stage, with a
language that was being shaped by being hewn out of the 'communication
stream' rather than by being absorbed 'through immersion.'   It was at this
stage that I discovered Glosa really had a life of its own.

    On further reflection, I have found that my thinking on, and usage of,
English has changed - as a result of my discoveries about language through
thinking about Glosa.  Such prognostications have led me to make
suggestions that, to develop fluency, one should aim at "thinking in
Glosa," and that Glosa, like the 'natural' languages, is congruent with
"the language of thought."

    And one factor, of the Glosalist experience, that has worried me as a
language researcher, is the small number of subscribers, who have actually
used Glosa to produce writing of over one paragraph, in length.  I greatly
enjoyed reading Bill Patterson's translation of "The Wolf," and was very
pleased that others were drawn into working on this translation.  Also, I
am glad to see, of late, a number of e-mail contributions in Glosa.  It
does however, definitely help me - in my research - to compare the Glosa
with an appended English-language 'translation.'

    Which reminds me to ask: how many Glosalist-pe are not venturing to
write in Glosa for fear of making 'errors'; and, how many contributors
would not like 'corrections' to their use of Glosa published on the List?
    This is a tricky point, with Ron gone, and Wendy currently not on the
Net, I offer suggestions for others who are learning to use Glosa.  So I
would make some suggestions and ask some questions.  Subscribers might
respond to the following statements on the Glosalist or directly to me:-
Yes . No. ?

   Friends, This is the first time I have asked for direct feedback from

Internet, some might feel that such questioning is an invasion of

"privacy" was generally current in the language; also, in the dim distant
past, when I joined the race, calling a "spade a spade" was a sign of
integrity.  Attempting to be 'modern,' I do not wish to force anyone to do
anything they do not want to do, nor do I wish to invade anyone's privacy;
however, in seeking the truth upon which science is supposed to be based,  
I would encourage all Glosalist-pe to send in a response, either privately,
or publicly.

New address for location of the glosalist archives:

http://members.nbci.com/ailanto/glosa/index.htm

The old address still works, but I don't know for how long. Their
Website FAQ doesn't give a straight answer on questions like this;
it just says that "it would be beneficial" to change your links.

Xoom bought NBCI or NBCI bought Xoom or they merged or something,
but apparently they didn't bother to tell their users! My first hint
of trouble was when I tried to ftp a new page to the site yesterday;
couldn't connect to the old ftp address. Tried a few times over the
course of the day and then gave up. Tried again today, still couldn't
connect. So I went to their homepage to see if they were having any
problems, and ended up at NBCI instead, and then learned the story.
The Xoom site has become NBCI, my xoommail.com address has become an
email.com address (but my old messages and address book weren't copied
over), and the name of the ftp site changed!

Note: This is undoubtedly true of *all* Xoom addresses. You may want
to check your bookmarks and websites and address books, using
http://members.nbci.com instead of http://members.xoom.com everywhere.
The old addresses still work, but I don't know for how much longer.
And email addresses like somebody{at}xoommail{dot}com are now somebody{at}email{dot}com
(though if they were the same as existing @email.com addresses (if there
were any), I guess they might have changed completely).

There either are affixes or not; examination of the
vocab proves that there are both prefixes and suffixes.
Beginners only avoid them for a while, not for long,
because they need to make certain distinctions:
credible vs. credulous, believed vs. believing,
believe vs. belief, believer vs. politician, etc.

This can be accomplished either by compounds or suffixes,
but they must be productive, i.e. usable spontaneously
rather than by consulting a dictionary. This requires a
real system, which is not clearly visible to me in Glosa.
"Glosa has no grammar" is not sounding so great anymore.
It looks to me like the authors just haven't finished it.

I don't know whether to use crypto-suffixes or head-last
compounding, and I doubt they could ever mesh well;
English does not use compounding for such things:
-able, -ive, -ed, -ing, -ion, -er, -ee, etc.
Glosa should add similar true suffixes rather than the
rather silly artificial -bo -po generics, or else state
clearly what compounds to use (pote-kredi, du-kredi, etc??).
Until then I don't expect to see people writing much in it.

*   Nick, please spell out for me what is meant by this, with a small

    Are you talking about the tendency to analyse the lexical components of
original Greek and latin roots?  Personally, I find the etymological
approach handy - to help me understand the 'flavour' of the original
source-words.  However, I do tend to think that the final forms of the
words in the derivative national languages have great linguistic value, and
that such syntheses should not be ^cracked open^ to retrieve the small
lexical seeds within .. for the purpose of further sythetic recombination.
    This does not cut across the idea of 'abbreviation', by which the
simplest functional form of a word is derived, often for the purpose of use
in compound formation.

Robin, that is exactly my point! You've illustrated it quite
well. I agree that there comes a thresh-hold to be crossed
at some point in a language learners experience when the
language is no mere translation or relexing of the thought
but a true expression of thought. I agree to some extent with
the idea of Sapir-Whorf that language can influence thought,
but I would not agree to the extreme they bring their conclusions,
so is my opinion, but I do believe that when thought is purely
expressed in a language, this fluent expression, is a great
step in a learners advancement in the target language. Some
people never reach that stage. In the case of some interlinguists
perennial tweaking only leads to much talk and experimentation
but they seem to never make the step to fluent expression of
thoughts. The continual tweaking has its fault in that the
changes prevent the full apprehension of patterns needed to
express thoughts fluently.

Since,
Jay B.

P.S. I liked your questionnaire and I'd be interested in it.
Egroups.com offers a poll feature in its system... Could
Glosa-l be archived through Egroups.com like Auxlang is already?

From: Charles <root{at}catty{dot}com>
Date: Wed, 27 Sep 2000 13:58:21 -0700

For those who have not observed Jay's tricks
in the other IAL mailing lists, I translate:

1. Jay believes only in Gode's Interlingua
and the Jehovah's Witnesses cult. His ethical
(and common) sense remains undeveloped.

2. Jay is here only to destroy Glosa.
He resists any attempt to improve it, because
it might become competition to his beloved Ila.

3. He will destroy discussion by any means,
as shown on AUXLANG and the Occidental/Interlingue
lists, and even on Jeffrey's list which explicitly
outlawed his tactics (Jay was banned there once;
nobody dares to post there now, since Jay returned).

4. Jay seems to think that I am such a "threat"
that he follows me to every open email list,
attempting to harass and annoy until I lose interest.
He is a flamer/troll; no list can long withstand
his provocations. I now request the list-owner
to ban or moderate his postings.

5. I tire of replying to others who have been misled
by his false attributions. Yet another example:

[Jay proposes:]

> A set
> of standards in word formation would definitely improve
> the language. For example any word ending in English
> "-tion" could be used as "-cio" in Glosa.

I do not subscribe to Jay's proposal.
Then, his mierda:

> But this would be a definite change of the language as
> it is, perhaps too great to call it Glosa anymore, more
> like Kosmo-Glosa and have Catty feeling all warm and
> fuzzy inside.

Why is it necessary for Jay to play such childish tricks?
Only I can speak for myself. Please, don't be misled by Jay's
continued personal attacks. Is that the sort of argument
that grown adults want to see on this list?

> >14 I wish some folks would just develop their own auxlang
> >and stop trying to change Glosa. (my addition)

All languages adapt or die. All people do likewise.
A dead Glosa would certainly fit Jay's plans for Ila.
But many people continue to hope that Hogben's original
idea of an analytic non-affix-bound IAL, creole-like,
can offer to the whole world an easier alternative
to the naturalistic European-based IALs such as Ila.
Among those, I much prefer Occidental; really, Glosa has
no chance of beating Occ at its own game ... Glosa's only
hope for success is in a creolistic reform direction.

    I will stay out of the pissing match.  However, it does seem
curious to me that more than one individual who seem to have made
choices for one or another naturalistic Euro-auxlang are even here at
all.  I do know of one person who decided that Glosa was not for him
and unsubscribed.  Although I have some preferences, I have not yet
really come down on the side of any one auxlang.  If I do and it is not
Glosa, or if I conclude that Glosa has no realistic prospects, then I,
too, would unsubscribe.

There is no such thing. You have witnessed Jay's attacks
in several elists, and now you want to equate the victim
with the perpetrator?? By calling it such, you just joined.
Turn every IAL elist into a sewer, go ahead ...

I see Glosa as the nearest thing to a creole IAL, but it needs
reform to become usable. Nobody is using it as-is, that's the proof.
If you want to play love-it-or-leave-it, that's your choice.
And, although dirty-politics always seem the dominant factor,
the technical quality of the IAL really does make a difference,
as proven by Volapuk's demise.

QUESTIONNAIRE ANSWERS FOR JAY BOWKS

> 1. I think in Glosa.
Once I get going on a translation exercise or
start writing my notes to this list in Glosa.
I find it easier to keep my word-list open just
in case memory fails me though.

> 2. Irregularities in the vocabulary prevent me from writing in Glosa.
No, irregularities are part of all languages.

> 3. A lack of clear-cut guidelines on syntax prevent me from writing in Glosa.
No but... The mechanics of Glosa afford a sample syntax
formula that one can imitate. But a grammar
book that examines these would be helpful for
some.

> 4. I do write in Glosa and am confident that I am using standardised sentence
form.
Yes. As long as I stick to the wordlists and the
mechanics I know it's good enough for use.

> 5. I do write in Glosa, but am in a state of subjective uncertainty over my
usage.
Not uncertain. I write Glosa when I feel up to
it and I have my wordlists and sample sentences
handy for reference.

> 6. As far as I know, my Glosa usage is correct, but I could be in error on
some points.
Yes, I might make errors, that's why I depend
on the wordlists and samples.

> 7. Sometimes when attempting to use Glosa, I find that there
> are some ideas I feel unable to express in Glosa.
Yes, at times, then I try re-expressing the thought
in other words. This is something that happens to me
in several languages. It is a skill to master, as I
see it. "Circumlocution" talking about the object using
other words which are familiar to you.

> 8. A better dictionary is needed before I can feel happy in attempting to use
Glosa.
Maybe. A better dictionary would help spread Glosa's
use... Something like a "Teach Yourself: Glosa" book
with a glossary included.

> 9. An instruction manual is needed before I can feel happy
> in attempting to use Glosa.
No, one can start with what is found right now on the
net. But a manual like I mention above would definitely
help spread Glosa to new speakers all over.

> 10. A basic grammar book will improve my use of Glosa
Yes, a grammar primer with exercises would definitely
give me some practice of the language so this would help.

> 11. A basic grammar book is needed before I can feel
> happy in attempting to use Glosa.
Not really. I'm happy right now. But I'd be delighted to
purchase a manual like the one I mention above.
                   
> 12. I can understand the structure of the language through
> observation of printed Glosa texts.
Yes the Glosa mechanics samples offer an easily followed
set of patterns one can imitate.

> 13. There are aspects of the language I seek further information on:
Yes and No. On one hand the limited set of words in Glosa
serve as a means easy access to the language. The fact that
it has a limited vocabulary also hinders progress. A set
of standards in word formation would definitely improve
the language. For example any word ending in English
"-tion" could be used as "-cio" in Glosa. This would
of course change the language greatly and through the
idea of word economy out the window. But it would make
Glosa very approachable by Westerners who share this
international standardised set of Latin terms. Going
further with this development one could drop the ending
and have derived the root of the verb. If, for example...
communication = "komunikacio" ergo "komunika";
transportation = "transportacio" ergo "transporta".
But this would be a definite change of the language as
it is, perhaps too great to call it Glosa anymore, more
like Kosmo-Glosa and have Catty feeling all warm and
fuzzy inside. 

>14 I wish some folks would just develop their own auxlang
>and stop trying to change Glosa. (my addition)
Definitely! The fact that Glosa is good enough to use in
actuall exchanges of messages by students of it is reason
enough to consider it worthy of acceptance as it is.
That some folks wish to keep tweaking it goes against
the development of Glosa so far. It was a project with
a copyright by two individuals, it was developed and used
and it is good enough to use. Those that wish to can make
their own language project as they desire it and call it
something else.

Here is a sentence in English with some analysis (head of phrase in caps) :-

[subject] the slightLy fat MAN with the long (and) black hair /  [verb] 
quickly GAVE / [object] the blue BIRD / [INDIRECT OBJECT] to the thankful 
WOMAN.

Reduce words to stems, present tense stems, simplify ****ful

the slight.fat ......... did quick GIVE....... ........ the 
full-of-thank......... 

Look up words in dictionary

u pusi.obesi ANDRO ko u longi e melani triko / pa tako DONA / u kiano AVI / a 
u ple-de-gratia GINA.

Note - adverb.adjective "little fat" not "little man" and "fat man", (pusi e 
obesi) like "longi e melani"

Try replacing the English words in the example above and translating into 
Glosa. You must have a subject and a verb but the object and indirect object 
can be left out. They need not be noun phrases.

Be brave! Show us your results!

This nightmare is not a joke, unfortunately it is Glosa truth.  
I asked Wendy Ashby about final vowels.  Yesterday I got a response 
letter from her that says it is about the way above. 

So Glosa is nothing else but English with Italian pronounciation and 
the words with Germanic origin avoided.  Sorry, I cannot see much use 
of such a system.  I am very disappointed.  Good night, Glosa.  

Of course, I was very glad to get a response from Wendy in spite of 
her personal problems and sadness. 
There is a little hope that Wendy will return to Glosa work later, 
though it cannot be recognized that it will go in a desirable 
direction then. 
Lights in the dark are Robin's work, his grammar, seminar #1 and 2.  
They could be cooked together with parts of Hogben's 
"Interglossa"-book and example sentences of "18 Steps to Fluency in 
Euro-Glosa" to a comprehensive and unambiguous introduction manual.  
And our Internet Dictionary, - as a starting base for a vocabulary 
reform.  But all this is far away.

  [I know it is dangerous for a visionary project like Glosa to write 
  such negative mails.  It could damage a lot.  Please excuse my

  Mi inklude PGN 37.  Kausa id dona info de fini vokali.  Ron ne pa 
pensi id es fo gravi-ra; id es pro mi tem faci plu kruci-verba!  Fini 
vokali ne es ge-nexu ko Latin alo Greko gramatika.  "Glosa 6000" bibli 
1992 pa gene grafo fo tako e per neo puta-me; ka-co, posi fini vokali 
posi ne es boni elekti.  Na pa akordo ko plu fini vokali in Central 
Glosa.  Probabli ATRIU gene uti te evita konfusi ko atro (black).  
Sometimes final vowel is left out ATR- could then mean black or hall.  
SILVA as in PennsylvAnia but SILVi as in Silviculture.  Ron suggested 
both could be used.  If choice necessary to have only one, choose the 
most common, choose the most common, which would probably be your 
suggestion of SILVA, as this occurs in plant + insect names etc. 

  PGN 81-82, 83 posi pa tena varita de plu ortografo.  Ron pa habe 
86 anua; an menta pa es fo boni pro u-la eva, qe?  An pa spende poli 
hora stude puta-me e Glosa ergo; an pa habe ma energi de ali-pe mi 
ski!

  Fu-tem mi nece gene Glosa lexi-lista ma stabili e difusi Glosa a 
poli-pe.  Mi es hedo; na difusi Glosa info per puta-me; place este 
libe de difusi ali-ra ex "PGN", "Sko-Glosa" alo plu bibli per u-ci 
mode; sed place deklara u fonta de ali ge-uti info.  Na nece kontinu 
u splendi ergo de Hogben e Clark.

  Mega gratia de tu stimula e auxi; mi fo valu tu persisti.

  Poli ami saluta

Well, final vowels were not given much importance by either
Ron or Wendy, according to the other message you posted.
So, it is as we surmised, and they are very easily repaired:
the rule is that they don't matter (are in "free variation")
in most cases, therefore need not be memorized.

We need to account for the few problem cases where they conflict,
that's all. But if we (thee? not me) happen to fix the finals
in an etymologically improved fashion, that can't hurt anyone's
feelings, and it can improve Glosa greatly and cheaply. Example:

15      animala      animal
234     animali      animal, beast
5       animaliza    brutalize

OK, I see Latin "animalis" as an adjectival form,
so -i is very plausible. If the Glosa word is to function
as verb/noun/adjective, maybe -i is the only good choice.

12345   ANIMALI      animal, beast, brute, brutal, brutalize

We could have fun going through the whole vocabulary.
Don't despair, recognizing a problem is the first step
toward solving it. Only denial or apathy fails utterly.

There are approximately 6848 Glosa words (including
spelling variants). The number of words containing
each letter, and their percentages:

a       4212    .615
b       740     .108
c       521     .076
d       963     .140
e       2780    .405
f       601     .087
g       821     .119
h       213     .031
i       3792    .553
j       77      .011
k       1821    .265
l       2015    .294
m       1327    .193
n       1945    .284
o       2977    .434
p       1394    .203
q       87      .012
r       2757    .402
s       2046    .298
t       2461    .359
u       1605    .234
v       536     .078
w       4       .000
x       221     .032
y       2       .000
z       101     .014

W and Y are really just errors or jokes, assuming
that whisk(e)y should really be spelled VISKI or UISKI.

A more serious reform would be to merge C K Q into one.
Another would be to merge Z into S, and eliminate X.
Why not eliminate H and J as well? Then we'd have:
ABCDEFG.I..LMNOP.RSTUV...., only 18 letters.
The H is not pronounced in modern Romance languages,
and J is pronounced I anyway in Glosa. So to complete
the intended fonetization of Glosa for global use, ...
