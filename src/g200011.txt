[ In my last mail I told that I sent a paper copy of our Glosa 
Internet Dictionary to Wendy Ashby.  Yesterday I got an encouraging 
reply from her. 
  When Ron died, she seemed to need distance from Glosa (look her 
letters I posted 00-08-04 and 00-09-30).  Now it looks like she 
returns and continues working for Glosa a bit.  
    // {"Inter-tem, ko tu auxi e gentili stimula mi re-proto Glosa 
    // aktivi; pro u-ci, mega gratia!"} 
  She even wrote that she would rather work full time for Glosa, but 
she needs to earn her living. 
  I am especially happy, that she will go through my Similar Synonyms 
list (see www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gsimsyn.htm ), because I think, 
that, when these problems are solved, Glosa's chances will grow. 
She sent two pages full of valuable notes to the list's items to me. 
And I hope to get more. 
    // {"Si mi ergo mo pagina ex kron a kron, sura mi fu fini id."} 
I will build them all into the dictionary then. ]

There is now a new web page with a dictionary of glosa words culled from 
glosalist and thier english equvalents from the internet dictionary. Unlike 
you concientious and hardworking compilers whom I envy, I am rather idle and 
confine my efforts to those words I use or read. It would be a good idea, I 
think, to compile a shorter and pocket dictionary on these lines which would 
be parallel to G1000. The address is:-
   http://hometown.aol.co.uk/sydpidd/myhomepage/writing.html

I have also ordered a translating program and will try to use it to compile 
short lists of Glosa to French, spanish, Japanese etc. I don't know how 
successful it will be but it could be a basis for further work. I will do one 
in German for Marcell to comment on and indicate how useful the others will 
be. Copmments generally will be welcome.

"Conscientious and hardworking", hehe, nice but exaggerated 
compliment.  Nevertheless, please, please, please, Syd, try to take 
the Core-dictionary of the Internet Dictionary 
    (www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gcoglen.htm and 
    www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gcoengl.htm ) 
instead of making a total new one.  We tried to parallelize it with 
Glosa 1000 already and we tried to use a bit linguistic statistics as 
scientific background for the word election.  There is so much to do 
with Glosa, so do not let us waste our energy with making boring work 
double.  When you think, Core is only rubbish, no problem: make 
comments and we will change it.

Great.  Please send it and I will look.  For French I bought 
"Glosa 1000 - Francais" from Wendy.  I wanted to put it on the net, 
but it is still not typed in yet.  When it will be ready, I will tell 
you and you can compare it with your program's output.

obrigado!
the Portugese use (abuse?) of final vowels is worth commenting on after all 
the discussion on glosalist - to follow
I think you misunderstand my intentions. My work on the dictionary is based 
on yours, I have added a few odds and ends -very few but the core dictionary 
is extraordinarily (73 years old and is struggling to spell his mother 
tongue!) long with many repeated and redundant words such as "position" -> 
"topo " and "loko" if I remember rightly also "zefir" fror west wind which is 
not likely to be used much. I am going through with the help of programs I've 
cobbled together  , to make a smaller pocket sized version of words that I 
actually use. I'm doing the same with as much of the glosalist glosa too. We 
are both doing different but useful work - we need the full one and also 
smaller ones from it
I am going to put together a web page with lots of glosa as glosalist seems 
to be mostly english which defeats the list's object
more to follow

Suggestions to reduce the amount of words in Core are always welcome.  
But your both examples are not right.  "zefiro  west wind" is only in 
Literary, not in Core.  And "loko" is in Core, "topo" not, although 
there is a difference, as Nick explained recently:  "loko" is 
place/area, "topo" is place/point.  See also PGN 71, p. 4.

These are great ideas, and your work will *not* be wasted.
In discussions on the Occidental lists, I've seen an odd effect:
people benefit more from making their own word lists than
from having a big thick official dictionary.

Dictionaries aren't very readable, so they don't speed-up
language acquisition, and the sheer mass of 6000 entries only
convinces people that they can never hope to master the language.
Glosa's shorter vocab and categorized lists are a big help.
Still, the ideal hasn't been reached (whatever that is).

A linguist friend of mine can quickly learn almost any language,
to a passable and usable degree, by translating his own list
of approximately 1500 essential words. I only know I can *not*
memorize over a thousand vocabulary items ...

This led me to the concept of the already-existing international
vocabulary based on Greco-Latin, as used in several well-known IALs.
European-language speakers (adult, literate) are already familiar
with these words or their cognate forms, etc etc.

In reading Glosa I have trouble with many of the words, some vaguely
recognizeable but ambiguous, others just completely unfamiliar.
Writing is easier, paradoxically, but seems almost like a code.
Not enough vocab, yet too much. Hence my dissatisfaction.
But maybe it works better for other people, or non-Euros.

Speculation follows ...

My own idea would be to take the super-productive verb roots
as discussed earlier, and try to build an entire vocab from them.
The basic ("light") verbs such as BE/HAVE/DO would be included
along with a few that have no super-productive equivalent.

Those (approximately) 100 verb-roots would be *all* ...
Learnable in a single weekend, easy to print on a single page.
Similarly, basic adjectives and adverbs would be defined,
just a limited set, e.g. things like "up" "good" "many".
Then a group of general-category nouns must be added, enough
for general discourse. Roughly then, 500 words in total.

Specific discussions would incorporate other words from the
international air, but not all of those words need to be listed
in an official dictionary, especially since they change so fast.
Today we need "vote" and "snippy", tomorrow something else.

The goal would be a list that can be learned and used easily and
most rapidly by an average adult who has some exposure to some
European language. Maybe it would work for Arabic, Turkish,
or some other language speakers as well. Anyway, it could
actually *work* ... A language for "eternal beginners" (like
Esperanto) is worse than useless.

I like Occidental well enough, but if Glosa can beat it
(by being easier or faster to learn by more people), great!
Or if we can borrow good compatible features between IALs,
better yet. A short basic word list is an important element.

I have loko and topo=put like the difference place area/point    this is what 
I am after with some of the repeats
the next bit I did yesterday     make of it what you can     some other 
interesting points this month I'll think about them
what we need most is lots of Glosa!

Dear Marcel
I seem to be working on a core dictionary from both top down and from bottom 
up. I'm getting a program to translate my english to glosa starting with the 
internet one (IND) and checking what it throws up. Often I get several glosa 
words and I check which I want and put the others in other files, this means 
that my own dictionary is getting tidied up and material that I don't want is 
pruned away. I am also going through glosa that is on glosalist and saving 
most of it. Doing this builds up some sort of core of words that are actually 
in use rather than slaving through a long long dictionary. My results I shall 
put on web pages every so often so that you can use the results if you want.
An example is the kroma thing I did.
I try to do a Charlie Darwin on it - natural selection or something.
Imagine a peasant in south asia...... name of  Andrews 
Killingham-Winton...... he knows only his own dialect but has a pocket 
Glosa/his dialect dictionary. He is having trouble with his crop and is 
asking a scientists .....Ping Pong of northern Europe for advice PP knows 
only his own language and also has an apropriate G dic.
(I did ask my printer to print out the internet G dic, it remarked that I 
must be joking - there were 92 pages!!)
 Among the symptoms were yellow leaves. When AK-W looked yellow up he found, 
as youknow from "Kroma", 6 words. This is where CD comes in..... Xanto has a 
double consonant cluster "nt" and a one and a half cluster begin K+s for "X". 
Now, some south asians as far as I know don't like double consonants so 
"xanto" got naturally selected out! Safro's "fr" was more acceptable but 
"leuko" with CVCV was naturally selected in and used. 
(If  I remember correctly, there are about 17000 or so entries in the IND, if 
there are on average 3 choices for the same English word and they are prunes 
to one, the IND shrinks to about 6000 !!)
(As far as I am concerned, I suspect I normally use about 4000 different 
concepts [ go, went, going, goes, gone etc are all variants of the one 
concept] so there are probably quite a few expressions etc in IND that  I am 
not likely to use much so my core dictionary could be quite small)
AK-W's crop had a local name like "lords and ladies" for instance so that he 
had no idea what it was. Obviously they need to use the scientific names as 
inculing them in the core d would make it impossibly long. 
While I was away, my files were cleared out presumably by AOL and I lost the 
addresses of your dictionary websites. I'd like to compare them with what I'm 
doing.
sorry about my burbling on but it will give me a chance of adding more glosa 
to search for extra words for my core effort.

I think your sentence is ambiguous:

"I have persuaded .. to work and (I) put .. " or

You will have use of files only in English, without Glosa, it seems.
I will send two files directly to your mail-address.  Saluta - Marcel

    If this interests you, ask me to send the "G-ASCII Analysed Syntax" scheme: can you imagine teaching syntax in the abstract?

>___|___|___  

*   Unless sentence style is taught and drilled, I suspect that learner will have to observe written Glosa, and 'intuit' the way sentences are put together in Glosa.  This was the method I used; however, by treating Glosa as a "concept language", i.e. one in which the abstractions of communication are paramount, I developed a feel for articulating the concepts.  Most languages facilitate a "concrete" approach to the juggling of 'things', objects, actions and descriptions.

*   The only way to jump the hurdle of developing subjective confidence is to get feedback on your use of the language.  For learning glosa, this means attempting to write in Glosa, and inviting others to make comments.

*   With such knowlege, the trick is to put your 'inexact' sentences on the Glosalist and asking others to look at how you have done it, IE

  Kron tu grafo uti Glosa, don u sekunda line te monstro tu tende.

(when you write using Gl. give a second line in-order-to show your interntion) 

  [When you write in Glosa do a second line to show your intention.]


> 7. Sometimes when attempting to use Glosa, I find that there

>                   are some ideas I feel unable to express in Glosa.

>Yes

*   It was a shock to me, when I first discovered such an inability to find a way of expressing a particular idea.  I am not talking about vocabulary deficiencies, though these can be very annoying, I suggest that it might seem impossible to get your mind around some particular combination of ideas, Glosa-wise.  I used the 'tell-a-story' method at first: I think of this as the "discursive" way of using language; if pushing a small number of words together does not produce a satifying rendition of your idea, then the concepts involved might need to be teased out to make a more long-winded, descriptive senternce.  

   Eventually, after doing this exercise a few times, you can start to recognise concept-heavy ideas coming up, and then, mentally, you start teasing the ideas apart before you come to actually speaking or writing.



> 8. A better dictionary is needed before I can feel happy

>inattempting to use Glosa.

>possibly.

*   For some people this was an insurmountable barrier to using Glosa.  But, working on vocabulary projects, as you have done, certainly raises your awareness of the usage of the different words.  

   For example, in thinking about the Glosa "water" synonyms, aqa (L.) and hidro (G.), I came to realise that water was not only the clear stuff you get out of a tap, but that there were many ways of thinking about 'water.  So, I came up with a range of 'water' situations and then tried out aqa and hidra, alternately, in these situations.  Perhaps it can be thought of as letting the feel of the word, in the mouth, decide your usage.


> 9. An instruction manual is needed before I can feel happy

>                   in attempting to use Glosa.

>Maybe.

*   It would certainly be a good idea, but originally Ron was not in favour of rule-based learning for Glosa; instead, he suggested more the "do as I do" method.

    One of the main reason for Glosa's slow development could be this lack of specific instruction on the fine-points of usage and sentence construction.

    While Glosalist members are taken up with refinements to the lexicon, we are not using our abilities to move on to the next step .. of specifying the rules behind the language, and forming traditional exercises for learners to go through, to practice them.


> 10. A basic grammar book will improve my use of Glosa.

>Yes.

*   This was my reason for attempting to produce one.

    I got good advice from other members of the planned language Mailing Lists during the process, and attempted to modify the tabulation of Glosa Grammar to include the suggestions.

    I think I included it on my website.  By inspection of written Glosa, any other observer could abstract a similar set of usage rules, and make his,or her, own 'Glosa Grammar.'


> 11. A basic grammar book is needed before I can feel happy in

>                   attempting to use Glosa.

>No.

*  This is a fortunate answer, because, at present such an *official* Glosa Grammar does not exist.  However, your response is 'correct' in that the usage is so regularised and standardised, that the inherent rules can generally be perceived and applied without taught instruction.

*   Is this a suggestion that because you use the language spontaneously and intuitively, and feel you are doing so correctly, though you cannot be certain that you have absorbed all of the rules through using this 'observational' method of learning?

*  Well asked.

   To standardise the use of the interrogative, the Glosa authors favoured a simple indication that a following statement should be taken as a question, by placing the 'flag, ~qe~, before the statement.

   However, the authors included a range of other "question-words" in the dictionary as well, because a speaker does not always want to reveal his question at the beginning of his sentence, or, perhaps, not even realise that he intends to put his information into the form of a question, until after he has started the sentence.  Most of these are found under "Q" in the dictionary, and were well covered in _Glosa Classified_. 

  ~Qe, an akti uno-ra?~

  (question: he does something)   ..  more, or less, means,

  "Is he doing something?"


  However, this pattern falls down if you want know what a person is doing.

  ~An akti qod?~ seems better than ..


  ~Qe, an akti qod?~,  ~Qe, qod akti an?~,  ~Qe, qod an akti?~ or ~Qod akti an?~.


   And then if we are looking for something, we could say,

 ~Qe, tu ski id loka?~  -- for "Do you know where it is?"


However, ~Qo-lo u ra?" and "Qe, u ra habe qod loka?~  don't seem as good.  We can try raising the question after making a statement, EG

   ~Memo un argenti; tu pa habe pa-di: qo-lo id habe nu?~.


   So, there probably are no rules .. beyond the the way the question feels comfortable for you.  The best way to reach a comfortable question format that is meaninful to others, as well, is to practise asking the same question in a number of different ways.

  

    I do apologise for not using Glosa to respond to your post, and also for not answering two months ago.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

How does ET work? Did you write it? Will it work on
other-than-Microsoft? Can it generate a web page, i.e. CGI?

My old sample http://catty.com/~catty/lang/dict.cgi
takes Glosa text and generates an English mini-glossary.
It accepts a certain simple format so could work with
other dictionaries.

Glosa is easy because there's so little morphology, but still
one can't quite do an effective word-for-word translation.

Dear Alex
I too find Glosa not as easy as it seems and have often had difficulty 
understanding some parts of PGN. However that also applies to English and to 
Hindi/Urdu and other languages I've tinkered with.Often with Glosa, I am not 
sure which is the verb(to have, to follow etc). See what you think of the 
following:-
Nu-di mana, u fo pusi obesi andro ko longi e melani trika pa tako sed gentile 
dona plu kloro avi a u an gina.
In Glosa the verb phrase is somewhere near the middle, like English but 
unlike Hindi (at the end) or Welsh (at the beginning [I think]), you can find 
the phrase by finding the word "pa". This word announces the beginning of the 
phrase and also indicates time. The end of the phrase is at the beginning of 
the next one, the word "plu". The signals for the start of a VP (verb phrase) 
are "pa", "fu", "nu" sometimes and "du". Unfortunately,the VP does not have 
this signal and this is often where I get lost.
In Glosa, the words in a group  like "tako sed gentile dona" tend to become 
more important towards the end and add precision to the last word's meaning. 
There are all sorts of ways one can give; willingly, reluctantly......... and 
so on and here the author has added "gentile" as an adverb ( makes the verb 
more precise) and also "tako". The conjunction"but" makes the status of 
"tako" and "gentile" equal and draws attention to the apparent contradiction 
in the two term's meaning.
In Glosa, the subject noun phrase normally is in front of the VP, this one is 
signalled by the beginning "u" and the end is where the VP begins .
u fo pusi obesi andro.........
ko longi e melani trika.........
"longi" and "melani" are connected with "e", they are both as important as 
each other and they both make more precise the meaning of "trika". The hair 
is both black and long.
The "ko" joins this group to "andro" and adds more precision as it is his 
hair.
There is no "and" or "but" before "andro".
"obesi" adss precision to "andro" - he is fat, "pusi" adds precision to the 
following word "obesi"- he is slightly fat, the "fo" adds to " pusi" so he is 
very slightly fat. 
"plu kloro avi" starts with "plu", the next phrase starts with "a u", this is 
all after the verb and is the direct object of the verb.
"a u an gina" This is the indirect object of the verb
He gave the birds to the woman
"kloro" adds precision to "avi", "u an" (the his) to "gina"
Actually, this looks very like the subject "u andro ko trika" and "u avi a u 
gina" but the meaning makes the construction clear. I am not very happy with 
that state of affairs and need to ponder.
"Nu-di mana," This phrase can be omitted without radically affecting the 
meaning of the sentence, it expresses time as does the verb and could become 
pa nu-di mana e tako sed gentile dona . This would be clumsy and, as there is 
only one verb phrase and it is clearly time, it can be moved to other places. 
The same cannot be done with "obese" as you would not know to which noun, 
"andro, trika,avi or gina" was obese.
Hope you can make something of all this, it has made me think .
syd

I bought ET from Dream..........software - you put english in the top panel 
and it produces a translation in the bottom one. I sent some ET german to 
Marcel, he found a few faults in the two or three sentences but I think he 
understood reasonably well what I was saying. I made my own program that 
called it and worked on its results. It seems to be pretty limited it was 
without about 5 or 10% of the words in the Glosa Core Dictionary. I would say 
that for its price and aims, it is quite adequate. I think it is available on 
machines other than PC. This may not be fair as only used a few of its 
facilities.They have a Web site
www.eDREAM.co.uk
What I should like is reasonably comprehensive english to other language dics 
that I could address as text files Shall bash on regardless for a while

    Due to personal circumstances I unsubscribed from Glosalist for a
time.  A few days ago I resubscribed, but about the only posts have
been very long files from Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com (if I have the address
right).  My mail filters automatically discard mail over a certain
size unless I make special arrangments, because I have to pay extra
real money if a large volume of mail pushes me over my disk allotment. 
Also, certain types of graphic files are of no use to me, anyway.  I at
least would appreciate knowing what these oversize files are so I can
have some idea what I am missing.

They are wordlists with Glosa, English and a third lang with
thousands of entries with this formula below. Actually pretty good
work

a ( ad) =  A  = at
a ( ad) =  A  = to
a ( ad) =  Verso  = towards
a fini =  Eventualmente  = eventually
a latu =  A parte  = aside
a-kron =  Puntuale  = punctual
a-kron =  Fino a  = till
a-kron =  Finché  = until
a-nu =  Ancora  = yet
ab =  Assente  = absent
ab =  Lontano  = away
ab =  Da  = from
ab =  Via da  = off
abili =  Capace  = able

etc.

Kudos on the compiling! Perhaps it would be a good
idea to have them as zipped up text files for ftp
download on the net.

w/regards,
Jay B.

Best is to make a web directory like, ahem, mine:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/ ... Then you can update
the files and simply announce the changes, giving
the URL. Also, you can ensure they are correctly
uploaded and readable, by checking via browser.
Only a few people will see your files here, but many
more will find you on the web, via search engines and
reciprocal links. But beware the web-groupies ... j/k.

The situation now is that we have "Glosainnercore" to and from French,  
Spanish, Italian, Portugese on my harddisc and the possibility of Japanese. 
We have Glosacore in English and German. Core gradually split into innercore 
and outercore when my translator informed me that some of core's English was 
not on EasyTranslator's list. I therefore took it off the Glosacore and 
slowly innercore grew. 
My next step is to take outercore and translate it the hard way from 
dictionaries. I have a Portugese one with me so that will be the first. I 
don't know how it will go.

I did try to upload dictionaries onto a web page but AOL seems to have made 
things difficult lately. It would be a good idea if someone took my 
dictionaries onto his/her 
machine.
I did not finish the German because it seemed pointless to try to do what has 
already been done and by someone infinitely more able to do it. If, however 
you would like to to see mine, I could send one to you

    If these could be made available for fetching other than by email I
could handle them, especially if they were zipped.  If Sydpidd(?) does
not have the facilities for this, perhaps some other kind soul could
assist.

I'm not quite sure how to zipp etc. What I should like to do is put them on 
one of my chaotic web pages but things are not working as they did  shall 
work on it . If the word lists are useful, it would be a good idea if they 
were stored in one or two different places apart from my hard disc etc also 
any ammendments by people who are better linguists, especially native 
speakers, would be welcome

One more thing about multilingual word-lists: They should have
a neutral and easily-machine-parse-able format. The standard
way is by tab- (and/or comma-) separated columns, e.g. ...

	Glosa, English, Chinese
	equs,  horse,   ma2

In the many cases of synonyms, best is to duplicate the whole line.
One could also add comments, but only beyond the last column
and/or introduced by a "metacharacter":

	# here are various animal species
	hipo, horse, ma2, # Greek source
	equs, horse, ma2  # blah blah blah

I don't really like whole-line comments to be interspersed,
because they are not easily loaded into a spreadsheet.

Haven't given format much thought except for my own computer program - i'm 
just relieved and thankful that some happens!
With a bit of a struggle, I've put glosa/italian on this site
   <A HREF="http://hometown.aol.co.uk/sydpidd/myhomepage/business.html">

it seems to take a long time to load - Solitaire is quite useful at 
times.........
