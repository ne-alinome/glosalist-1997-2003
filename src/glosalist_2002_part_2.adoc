*  Nice idea, Kevin.
   I would rather see it as research into new subject matter: a tutorial
written by Sid, me, or anyone else.
   But I am not in favour of rehashing the "18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa."
I would rather leave this historical work in the archive area, and not play
around with it.
   This suggestion, of going through a current attempt to use Glosa, does
appeal to me.  It reminds me of the way I used to do amateur teaching of
English to Asians: I would ask someone to volunteer a sentence; then I
would write it on the white-board exactly how they said it; next, I would
ask the other learners for suggestions on ways of improving it.

*  OK, if vocabulary does come first, then this gives us an urgent reason
for getting a standardised lexicon, so that spelling ceases to be a
"variable."
   The different people who present tutorials might use different levels of
vocabulary - Mega Glosa, Core Glosa and Mini Glosa - so, it seems obvious
to me that the whole lexicon ought to be standardised prior to commencing
the 'debugging' of one, or more, tutorials.
   I certainly would be prepared to work on the basis of accepting the GID
as it stands.  However, with the inputs from Wendy and Marcel in
straightening out the last few ambiguities, I would suggest that this
revision be completed before tutors are written.
   On the qustion of Mini Glosa, or Glo, as you appropriately abbreviate
the name, it looks like it is going to be an accepted starter vocab
variant, rather than a standard-setting renewal of the whole lexicon.  EG
~do~ rather than ~domi~
   My feeling, seeing Glo from the perspective of the "Three Bears,"
suggests that a tutor written using the present Glo vocab would be a bit
hard on the reader.  I suspect that Glo needs a bit of fleshing out: the
ribs are showing through; it feels just a bit lean for comfort.  Maybe it
ought to be 600 words rather than 500.

Saluta,

Robin

   Yes, the question of the ultimate utility of an IAL definitely comes in
here.  However, I suspect that a standard "test," of all contenders for
global adoption, presented by 'authorities' like Linguists and UN
Professor, will be to translate some difficult poem.  I was challenged in
this way while on the Conlang Mailing list.

*  Being a 'creative' myself, I might have trouble with the idea of making
Glosa so boringly repetitive that it puts off other creatives.
   To get Glosa off the sliprails, I feel we need all the brains we can
get.  There is a danger that the more 'sensible' it get, then the less fun
it is.

>     On the other hand, a

*  Ron Clark was forever saying this, too: I found it an extremely
uncomfortable way of being creative.  Having a very tight vocabulary, while
it might bring out the best in some creatives, can be extremely daunting
for the non-creative reader, who is unable to match the mind of the
creative writer.
   I never did know if Ron was rationalising the use of Glosa 1000 - for
printing/postage reasons; or if he sincerely thought that there was a
danger of spoon-feeding IAL-users, by giving them too many words to play
with.  I would say that you can go over the top, and have words and
inflections for everything, as Esperanto does, thus over-stretching the
learning task.  And, I can see the great value in providing learners with a
suitable Mini-type Glosa.  Also, I do know that Ron Clark was quite serious
- and, I feel, correct - when he said that we don't have to say everything
in total detail, because the listener, or reader, goes halfway towards the
speaker, or writer, to understand what is being said.
   We are again ^trying to hit the happy medium^ between a 'dry,' terse
language, and a warm and fuzzy, verbose one.

   No Kevin, I suspect that you missed the ^fine print^: the hyphen, I
fear, was lost beside the tilde.
   When I said "abbreviation" I was not giving a blanket approval for "ge"
to replace "gene", I was referring to the specific case of
compound-building, using "ge-" ... in the same way that, in Mega Glosa,
"-pe" is an abbreviation for "persona", and "-do" is for "domi."

   But I would ask: do people say Glosa sentences to themselves, either out
loud, or in their heads, before committing them to type?
   What I'm getting at is the very un-Linguistic quality of "feel."
   When we come up with a sentence in our native language, we usually know,
instantly, if it 'feels' right, or not .. regardless of grammatical
correctness.
   Without wishing to be too innovative, I would suggest that a ^well
turned^ Glosa sentence has a noticably good 'feel' to it, and when we read
it back to ourselves, the intended meaning comes flooding back into our
brain.  Which is as it should be, for Glosa; and as it is, for all native
languages.

*  Fair enough.  For people who learn Glo, and then choose to expand their
vocab, they have an additional level of synonyms (Glo/Glosa).
   And for those who learn Glosa first, and then read something with
distictly Glo constructions, this should not present a great problem.
   I would suspect that ~go~, and any others like it, ought to be included
in the larger dictionary as legitimate abbreviations of the
'interchangeable' variety, as well as being compoundable.

   You have described, above, the use of the shorter forms as full words,
which allows them to form compounds - not as "generics".

   The use of "toy" was not derogatory, but more 'metaphorical.'  However,
I will not use it again: instead, I will attempt to get you to adjust the
range of basic root-words to make Glo more usable; also, I wish to see the
(I can say) derivative language tested through use, and developed as a
result of experience.
   There are precedents, some in sci-fi, of derivative languages that have
persisted where their mother language has become extinct.  While I do not
imagine this to be the prospect for Glo and Glosa, I will be watching
carefully.
   I do have the feeling that the 'Target Population,' which Glo is aimed
at, needs more definition.

    Prompted by your detective work, I have ticked in "Styled Text," the
option "Discard styled text before sending".

    While I do not think this will revert everything to plaintext, it will
stop me from trying the optional BOLD, UNDERLINE and ITALICS.

I tend to write Glo/sa sentences first, and then go back
and read them to myself to see if they make sense and
"feel" good. I spend less time improving my Glo/sa
sentences in email messages than I do in documents that I
expect to last a long time. I agree there is an aesthetic
quality that Glo/sa writers should aim for, but I'm not
sure I can (or ever will be able to) describe it.

> *  I still have doubts as to the ability to satisfy

As you hinted in another post, 500 is not an absolute
limit. I originally targeted 600, but when I found the
first draft at 450 words, I reset my goal to 500. If more
roots are needed, more will be added.

>    The use of "toy" was not derogatory, but more

I appreciate that. I would accept any of these adjectives
without offense: mini, subset, reduced, stripped down,
simplified, derivative.

I dislike (to varying degrees) the adjectives: toy,
learning version, training wheels, stepping stone.

And I hope to adjust the root words accordingly.

An interesting thought. I see the target as being the same
as most IAL's. Of course, it has different strengths from
other IAL's, and so would be likely to appeal more (or
less) to people with different tastes and backgrounds. I'll
have to think more about this, and probably come up with
some kind of "position statement".

I'm not sure that's necessary. I would hope that any
tutorial would stick to some core vocabulary at least 99%
of the time. In those rare cases where a non-core word was
used, I would hope we could use a substitute word for our
grammar discussions.

I'm not quite sure what you mean here, so perhaps you could
expand on your thought. I hope that Glo will be as close to
a subset of Glosa as possible. To the degree that it is a
subset, I would hope that it could also serve as a "mini
core" lexicon for Glosa.

By the way, I do hope to start work on a Glo tutorial
within the next few weeks. I think it's an important part
of getting people to learn and use Glo. There is some more
important work to do on the word list before I will shift
my attention to the tutorial. However, I am not going to
wait until the word list is "finished", because I plan to
use the tutorial as a test of the language, and will
probably make several vocabulary changes along the way.

I don't yet have any concrete ideas about what form the
tutorial will take.

Kevin

Very interesting. My first reaction is that many people on
the Conlang list have artistic (non-IAL) goals, and for
them a poem would be an excellent way to judge a language.
I'm not sure how relevant it is for selecting an IAL.

Nope. I was thinking more about our past discussions
comparing things along the lines of:

I pressed the 'A' button with my finger.
I fingered the 'A' button.
I buttoned an 'A'
I "A"'d.

So you are saying that ~ge-~ and ~ge~ have different
meanings. The first is a synonym for ~gene~, but the latter
is not. This type of confusion is exactly why I have
reformed the generics in Glo.

Unless and until I learn something new, I will continue to
have the following Glo words:
~ge~: get (become), become, passive voice indicator
~gene~: get (obtain), obtain, receive

Feedback is always appreciated.

I had a notion that "gene" might become a verb particle that told us that the 
object phrase was before the verb and that the subject was elsewhere or 
missing and that "ge" turned the following word into an adjective ( no hyphen 
needed)
U ci pa gene grafo nu-di (per/ex mi)

U ci ge grafo poesi pa es in PGN.

As I understand it ~ge~ is not a word in Glosa, but
only a prefix (ie ~ge-~ {with hyphen}).

~gene~ is a word in Glosa meaning -
            "get, receive, acquire, become or obtain" 
               a "thing, quality or state"

~Mi pa gene u grama.~

Subject: [glosalist] TriBrunoZoa 0.3  Edited -->  0.3A

--=====================_1015516558==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Mi Plu Amika,
  Here is an edited version of my earlier attempt to casting the first
third of the _Tri Ursus_ story into Glo.

  It seems to be working.

  The Bears' house is at the end of the path, which does not simply pass by
their home.

  I have gone along with most of Kevin's suggested alterations, but
probably wish to retain responsibility for both Glosa and Glo renditions.

  Needless to say the original, possibly Evanescent - if not Old -
 Glosa version of _Tri Ursus_ will come up for review, soon.  I would guess
that this ought to be an exercise for all on Glosalist.  It could possibly
be edited in parts, as is being done with the Glo version.  Any suggestions?

  In the Glo version, we changed the season from Spring to Autumn.

  I would like to see 'equal and opposite action' in Glo, so suggest a
"push" to balance Glo's "pull" of ~tira~ or ~trakto~.  It could be GID's
either ~impakti~ or ~pulsa~, but I favour the archaic Old Glosa ``peli``.
The Latin dictionary mentions  impello  and  expello  as well as  impulsus
among its renditions of "push."

  Closing things .. as well as having them open [Glo:aperi] .. seems also
in need of being covered - possibly with ~klude~.

  A bit of soft usage comes with the easy-to-say ~in qi~, whereas, as Kevin
Points out, ~intra qi~ is the '''correct''' form.  I first noticed such
?slackness? when it came from the Glosa authors; however, I decided that
this must be another of their intuitions about the rounding-off effect of
usage over time.  So, while ~intra qi~ [inside which], is the correct form,
the average Glosa speaker is more than likely to 'lose' the rest of the
word, and soften it to the more-easily-said, but incorrect, ~in qi~ [into
which].

  I look forward to seeing the adjusted version of the Glo vocab.

Still TriBrunoZoa 0.3-->1 to go,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S. I think mu Eudora has been corrupted, so will muddle through,
sending "plaintext" and "Attachments" as well as I can. R.

Yes.

In 18 Steps ~in~ is intended to mean just in or
inside and into is ~ad-in~. ~intra~ means
indoors or inside.

I think ~in~ meaning into is now Old Glosa.

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary update
From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 2002 17:51:41 +0100


A dictionary update: 

* Now ALL items from the "Similar Synonyms"-list are taken into 
  consideration.  Most of these inconsistencies are removed now.  

(Of course I made errors with that.  Some decisions were not easy and 
certainly I made the wrong hit sometimes, though I tried hard to 
respect Wendy's wishes.  The problem with the final vowel is now mainly 
solved, although final vowels remain difficult to memorize for me, but 
that may belong because I am coming from a language that has lost most 
of its final vowels.) 


Other news: 

* ali/uno-problem solved, corrected and cleared.  Thanks to Wendy
  Ashby and Nick Hempshall for their help.
* The list of "Useful Prefixes" (book "Central Glosa", p. 74-75) 
  is now completely included.  You can have a look at them in 
  English-Glosa, search under "P"
  ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/engl.htm#gep ) for "prefix".
* The list of technology words (newspaper "Plu Glosa Nota", No. 86, 
  p. 6) is now included.  Now there are official words for internet, 
  e-mail and file (computer). 
* Formatting routine changed: In English-Glosa now the prefereable 
  Glosa word comes first.  The expired ("X") words are only in 
  Glosa-English and not any longer in English-Glosa. 
* Few things from Kevin's Core-list, although I did not work through it 
  systematically yet.  Thanks to Kevin for providing a raw-text-version 
  on his website.

So your distinction is that if you ~gene~ an adjective, you
become it, but if you ~gene~ a noun, you receive it. Right?

But what about: ~Mi pa gene piro.~

Did I obtain some fire (in a safe, controlled way), or did
I burst into flames?

Or ~Mi pa gene aqa.~

Did I receive some water (in a safe, controlled way), or
did I get wet?

  The flower was give(n) by the man.(*?)

   I am not sure that ~u dona flori~ is:-  a given flower
                                           a giving flower
                                           a gift flower

                                       or  a give flower*

   But I do know that a got-give flower .. u ge-dona flori
uses the normal 'verb', ~dona~, as a participle, with the function of an
adjective.

   However as I still understand it, ES and GENE while not being supposed
to be confused with one another, are supposed to be interchangeable in
their 'VERB' function. 
EG
  ~U janu nu es ge-klude: id pa gene ge-klude pa-di.~
[the door now is got-close, it did get got-close past-day]
   The door is now closed: it got closed yesterday.

The alternative, minus the "ge-" participle-forming prefix, is:-

  ~U janu nu es klude: id pa gene klude pa-di.~
[the door now is close, it did get close past-day]
   The door is now closed: it got closed yesterday.

This second form is:
    . a lot easier to say;
    . the present 'standard';
    . understandable in most everyday contexts; but
    . not as exact as the now defunct construction. 

** Needless to say, I feel that the extra grammar loading, of using a
short, particle-forming prefix, is a small price to pay for those who
understand the subtlty of the passive voice, and want to use it in their
utterances: a price they would happily pay for the certainty that others
understood their intention to use the Passive.
   
>1. drop GENE and instead use ES (for the passive voice)
*  No.  I sometimes feel the need to differentiate between "getting" and
"being."

>2. keep GE but also use DU (for the pair of participles)
>
*   ~Tu es du-morta.~     Act thingo, Scene whatever, "Julius Caesar"   
   [thou be ing-die]
     You are dying.

    ~An pa es ge-morta.~  Act thingo, Scene later, "Julius Caesar"
    [he did be get-dead]
     He was killed.
                                MAYBE

What about:-
     ~Vide! An gene ge-morta!~   Plebian at scene of crime: same play
    [see, he become get-dead]
      See! He gets killed!
and:-
     ~Ki ad u Kapitol, nu-di, e tu fu es du gene morta.~
   [go to the Capitol now-day, & thou will be -ing get dead]
     Go to the Capitol, to-day, and you are getting killed.
                              Portia's "Big Julie don't go!" speech

>Just idle speculation, of course. (Jo was a unisex nonce-name.)
>
*   He/she is alright; Jo is not a nonce!
    B. and C. I go along with. 
    A. I am not happy with: poss. ES is not wanted; prefer GENE to GE.
How about:-
  U flori pa gene dona a Jo.          U flori pra es dona a Jo.  (O.G.)
 [a flower did get give to Jo]  OR  [a flower had be give to Jo]
  A flower was given to Jo.         A flower had been given to Jo.

AND
  To u-la momenta, u flori pa du es gene dona a Jo.
 [at that moment, a flower did cont. (to)be get give to Jo]
  At that moment, a flower was being given to Jo.

**  The problem is with the VERB PHRASE.
    I continue to work on the principle that there is a fairly
well-determined 'good syntax' sequence of word-functions within the Verb
Phrase.
    If Glosa has a "Head Final" phrase structure (most significant word
last), and I think this is the only conclusion from observation of PGN and
other prose from Glosa Central, then, we might ask if there is a gradual
rise in significance of the words from start to end of each Verb Phrase. 
    A suggested significance sequence could be ...

Neg. Simple Aspect/ Function Modifier(s) Verboid Substantive Auxillary
part tense   Mood    'verb'   <adverbs>             'verb'    'verb'
      part.  part.
EG
 ne    fu     sio      es       tako       pote      ki         apo

   So, in the excitement of the story, this would flow:-

   Tem u teri-kausa melano ursus pa tenta vora un andra, an undu u du piro
brancha ante id.  An ski ke an amika pa tenta sti u dina-me de mu vagona
pro mu eskapa; e, iso tosto de an pote audi u soni de u dina-me, an sio
peli u branca ad un ursus, e kursi ad un aperi janu de u vagona.
   An kredi ke kron mu pa es intra u moti vagona, mu fu sio es tako pote ki
apo.
   Sed kron u dina-me pa sto, mu ne sio es pote tako ki apo, e un ursus pa
du kursi ad u ge-sto vagona ...

**  More work is needed: there are some alternative sequences - as in
English; however, Verb Phrases do seem to have a pattern of sequences   -
as has already been demonstrated with Noun Phrases, which have a simpler
structure. 
 
Saluta,

Robin

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 9 Mar 2002 12:40:13 -0800 (PST)

I'm trying to get this straight in my mind (and in the Glo
word list).

According to GID:

~de~ is: about; belong; concerning; from; in relation to;
of; of (concerning); relating to; than

~ex~ is: out from; by (marker of doer by passive voice);
ex-; from; out; since

In particular, note that "from" appears in both lists. I'm
trying to figure out how to describe how someone would
choose one over the other.

It seems that ~ex~ is used for authorship and emergence
(the crew came out of the ship).  

It also has "out", like ~u ex-urba area~ (the area outside
the city). Normally I would expect that to be ~extra~, but
I suppose this is an abbreviation. Perhaps in Glo I could
combine ~ex~ and ~extra~, like I am considering with ~in~
and ~intra~.

This list implies that it would also be used for an
ex-employee (someone who used to be an employee), which I
guess is related to the "since" that is listed. But those
two don't seem to fit the rest of the definition. In ~mi pa
ze vora ex pa-di~, why would this use ~ex~?

I guess it's like I haven't eaten "outside" yesterday.
Seems like a metaphorical stretch. And we have "po" which
seems better anyway.

Now, ~de~ is for belonging (like a dog _of_ mine), and
concerning (like a book _concerning_ food). The "than"
merely seems to reflect that ~de~ fills in where no other
little word fits, like in ~ma sito de~. 

I suppose if I say I "_am_ from Seattle", that would imply
a belonging, rather than a trip origination point, and so
would be ~de~. So I guess we have:

~mi pa veni _ex_ u Texas~
I came from Texas (Texas was my location)

~mi es _de_ u Texas~
I am from Texas (Texas is my affiliation)

They are major case markers, even if "Glosa has no grammar".
DE = genitive, EX = ablative, IN = locative, AD = dative.
They are also major derivational prefixes. Lots of fun.

Ogden's Basic English used the English phrasal verbs
in a similar fashion, to minimize vocabulary. Why not
just relex BE to NT Greek and call it Glo-lite?

Ah, this was actually helpful, because it steered me to
some good websites via google. I now have this map, which
is probably not entirely accurate, but which helps me see
how we got from "there" (Latin) to "here" (Glosa):

nominative: [no marker] (i see=mi vide)
accusative: [no marker] (you hit me=tu bate mi)
vocative: [no marker] (sir, please sit=an, place sedi)
genitive: de (my tool = ru de mi)
ablative: ex (written by mi = grafo ex mi)
locative: in (live in town=eko in urba)
          tem (sleep at night=somni tem noktu)
          a (start at noon=proto a meso-di)???
dative: a/ad (give it to me=dona id a mi)
        pro (do it for her=akti pro fe)
instrumental: per (cut with a knife=seka per seka-ru)

I still don't see where this ont fits in:
     de (more than three=ma de tri)

This is good news. I am going through my Glo list and
updating it as necessary to keep it as close to GID as
possible.

Some of the renamed words are interesting. I am up to the
"P"s, and so far these Glo words have been affected:
 levo -> laevo
 ludo -> ludi
 materi -> materia
 nexi -> nexu
 nume -> numera

I assume the earliest entry starts with "l" because GID
changes were done alphabetically, and earlier GID revisions
were already reflected in my Unofficial Core and Glo lists.

I'm a bit surprised by laevo (which was changed in GID last
October, and I just hadn't realized it). The new version is
harder to pronounce, and is a bit closer to 'lava' than I
would prefer. But 'levo' might be confused with levitate,
so I can see some benefit as well.

I'm slightly disappointed that three of these (laevo,
materia, numera) involved replacing shorter, simpler words
with longer versions. 

When I get to the end of the Glo list, I'll report on
whatever remaining words had to change. I assume this is of
some interest to any Glosa-pe, because the Glo words are
sort of like a mini-sub-core list of Glosa words.

I assume this is still a work in progress. 

Also, I noticed that there are some entries in glen that
are not alphabetical.

The way I see it, is that ~de~ starts off
meaning "belonging to", "of" and "from".

Compare - the man _of_ la Mancha.

Then moves on to cover "concerning", 
"in relation to" and "about".

Compare Cicero's works -
 De Legibus (On the Laws)
 De Officiis (On Duty)
 De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)

Then on to cover "than". ~ma de tri~
"more in relation to three".

Saluta,
Nick

PS 

Glosa also has ~ab~ with the meaning "from"

~Mi trena ab London a Paris.~

The only renamed word in the last "half" of the Glo list
was simbola->simboli.

I just posted new Glo lists, which have those few words
renamed to match the GID, and also have many new and
clarified English meanings. I also cleaned up the column
indicating whether a word was 'modified', 'renamed', etc. 

Mostly, I added the 'modified' tag on several words where
the meaning is similar to GID, but where I have omitted a
major part of the definition, or substantially extended the
definition.

Are you sure, we are both talking about engl.htm (English-Glosa)?
If so, I do not understand you.

For instance, when the user is looking for a Glosa word for "goat", he
would find, if I would have used the old program:

"goat  aegi {=egi, prefer kapri} GX; egi {prefer kapri} G; hirkus
        {prefer kapri} G; kapra {=kapri} 1X; kapri 1++"
        
This was ugly and difficult to survey.  He received several meanings
first, which he should not use.  Some of them are really bad and
expired.  Now he gets:

"goat             kapri 1++; egi (prefer kapri) G;
                   hirkus (prefer kapri) G"

The Glosa1000/Core-word comes first, then the Mega Glosa words, and
not any longer error-words like "kapra".  If the new program works
(please report errors to me, that I can fix it), I think it is an
improvement.

When you are talking about glen.htm (Glosa-English), you are right.
This will be a task for the future.



Tu grafo:
 > Ze-ordina verba nu ge-loka po singu de plu-ci verba:

In GID:
 # ...
 # audi-me          speaker (loud-speaker); loud-speaker
 # plu audi-pe 1    audience
 # auge             ...

Of course, these "errors" are intended.  If the user has a text with
"... blablabla plu audi-pe blablabla ..." in it and he does not know
"plu audi-pe", he will not look for "plu audi-pe" but for "audi-pe",
because he thinks, that he knows "plu" as the plural marker already.
And so he should find "plu audi-pe" between "audi-me" and "auge".

About your other examples, "gene u fax - receive a fax" and
"duce fenestra - main window (computer)" we can discuss about.  Does
it say more about "gene" or about "fax", more about "duce" or about
"fenestra"?  I decided for the last ones, because "fax" is stronger
than the empty "gene".  Perhaps I should take in both: "fax [gene u ]"
AND "gene u fax"?

If somebody wants to scan such items and make suggestions for
changing, he can search with his browser in
http://www.glosa.org/gid/engl.txt for the brackets "[".  Thanks in
advance.  Greetings - Marcel

Whoops. No, I was referring to glen, which as you agree
still lists the words in a non-ideal order. I never even

I understand this approach, but still find it uncomfortable
to have some words out of order. Other ways to accomplish
this would be "audi-pe, plu", "(plu) audi-pe", or "audi-pe
(plu)". None of them are very appealing to me either.

I'm not sure here. I think it is really a decision for you
to make, as the owner of the list. In my own Glo list, I
plan to keep it strictly alphabetical, partly because I
don't know how to decide in these cases that could go
either way. It's easier to have one rule and be consistent,
even if the result is sometimes imperfect.

Thanks for pointing this out. It brings up a VERY
interesting Glosa issue, and I would really like to hear
ideas from everyone.

The sentence, as written, has no verb or noun markers,
which is an error on my part. Therefore, it should have
been at least: ~Mi du volu auxi e ze krati~. 

Now, if you KNEW that I ALWAYS use noun markers for my
direct objects (I try to, but certainly do not always
include them), then you could correctly interpret ~auxi~
and ~ze krati~ as infinitive verbs. If I had been asking
for help, I would have said ~Mi du volu u auxi e u ze
krati~.

In the case of ~auxi~, it would seem that it cannot be used
as an intransitive verb, as I tried to do. I intentionally
left off the direct object, because I was trying to help an
abstract situation, more than a specific person. But I
really should have said ~Mi du volu auxi e ze krati tu~.

It never even occured to me when I wrote this sentence that
~auxi~ might be interpreted as a noun. Which leads me to
wonder if perhaps every Glosa sentence should always have
explicit verb and noun markers everywhere, to avoid
confusion. For example:

> ~Mi volu dona auxi, ze krati.~
> I want to (give) help, not to dictate.

This seems to work, except that it could be:
I want gift-help
I want to give help
My desire gives help
My wish-gift helps
...and possibly others

Kevin

My experience in writing English parsers indicates that the best way
is to forget "parts of speech" and focus on what look typographically
like phrases to us (both English and French speakers). In many natlangs
a phrase like your example "want (present tense) to help (infinitive)"
would be a single word.  Glosa's complex syntax and simple morphology
permit elision of tense etc, at the risk of telegraphese ambiguity.
The full canonical form including tense etc is the true "underlying"
Glosa sentence, even when the writer cuts some corners.

*  Plu Amika,
   No P-o-S markers are needed - in my opinion.  All that is required is
good usage, and simple, or, alternatively, clear, sentence construction.

   With well thought-out sentences, or even sentences with well-defined,
and well punctuated, phrase/clause structure, the function of each word
ought to be obvious.

   I am surprised that Charles, with years of using English, did not
peceive the :help: concept as a noun when it was so intended.  If there
might be any confusion, ~un auxi~ should clear the matter up.

Saluta,

Robin

I roughly agree with this order. My suggestion
would be 

1) ~ne~   (or even ~ja~)
2) ~nu~, ~pa~, ~fu~, ~nu pa~, 
                 ~nu fu~, ~fu pa~, ~pa fu~
3) ~sio~   
4) ~du~
5) ~fo~, ~mega~, ~pusi~, ~sub~, etc

7) ~tako~, ~holo~, ~fo-fono~, ~tekno~ etc 
8) ~es~, ~ki~, ~vora~, ~dice~, ~dona~, ~auxi~, ~sti~  
      etc
9) ~ci~, ~intra~, ~ana~, ~qestio~, ~fobo~ etc
10)  repeat of 7)


With none of the elements being mandatory.

I should point out that it was not Charles who originally
mentioned the confusion. And the fault certainly did NOT
lie with the reader. The problem was that the sentence
itself was confusing.

In this case, I could not put ~u/un~ before ~auxi~, because
I wanted it to be a verb, not a noun. Mentally, I used the
omission of a PoS marker to indicate its verbness.

You suggest adding PoS markers "If there might be any
confusion...". But the problem in this case is that I (the
writer) incorrectly believed that there could not be any
confusion. I really thought I had written an unambiguous
sentence. Now, If I had gone back and thought about it for
five more minutes, perhaps I would have caught my two
errors.

That's the danger of omitting "u" and "nu": As the author
(or speaker), you know what you intend to say, so your mind
can fill in the missing pieces. The reader (or listener)
may have a completely different perspective. Thus, I think
PoS markers (u/plu, pa/nu/fu) should be used in almost all
cases.

There are a few certain words that imply a PoS, and
therefore don't need an explicit one. Pronouns, I think,
can work without u. And I think we have a consensus that
~es~ does not need a pa/nu/fu because it can "only" be a
verb. There may be a few other exceptions, but I can't
think of them right now.

Kevin

So GE is just English -ed, relexed. Naturally it inherits the ambiguity.

So ES is stative and GENE dynamic, like is/get or ser/estar

Yes, but in your message today you took the opposite position.

Rather, "He was dead." To make a killing out of death you need
a causative particle instead of the GE/GENE mess.

Well, there could and should be, but isn't (in G). An auxlang needs
to be both simpler and more rigorously logical than a natlang.

And if zero-marking means verb, then a noun phrase can't use it.
You have found a good counter-example to the elisionist position.

Maybe it would be better to call them "phrase indicators",
because G has no POS other than "particles" vs. "full words".
That's why I mentioned the need to parse phrases (not words)
in both English and Glosa. The junctions between verbal and
nominal phrases, especially, must be clearly marked.

That's exactly the way analytic langs work. There's some
blurring of the lines between particle and full-word.
(I just categorize pronouns and auxiliaries as particles.)

I agree, no phrase markers should be mandatory.

Human beings dont speak logic, and a language
that required complete lack of ambiguity would 
be impossible to use correctly.

As a second language for everyone, an IAL needs
to help the users be clear and be understood. So
a variety of means is required -
  syntax rules
  punctuation rules
  compounding rules
  phrase markers
  lack of idiom
  clear definitions for words

Saluta,
Nick

Subject: [glosalist] spain, problem, syntax store
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sun, 24 Mar 2002 14:37:33 EST

just returned from a very interesting visit to Spain.
Lots of food for thought - am trying to catch up with the last flurry on 
Glosalist.

Had a problem last week that has bearings on Glosa.
I needed to make some enquiries in my extremely limited Spanish. What I 
should have done, is to write down in English what I needed to say. Then make 
a store of the words and syntax and from there, sort out the Spanish. 

Here is an attempt ending up with orthodox Glosa.

1) sentence= V, S and O
2) V= simple present tense/ not third person singular/ concept="thought"
3) S= pronoun/ first person singular/ subject
O= clause 2
4) clause2= V2, S2 and O2
5) V2= past tense/ not third...../ concept=" lose"
6) S2=  pronoun/ first person singular/ subject
7) O2= noun/singular/ concept="camera"/modifier=posessed by pronoun
8) pronoun= first p,singular/ adjective


In orth G, phrase order= S V O
(cap M) Mi puta (O=clause2, orth G uses ";" here ) ; (S2 V2 O2)
mi pa lose u mi kamera.

Mi puta; mi pa lose u mi kamera,

to spanish(?) (V S joined) 
Penso que he perdido mi maquina.  ( approx?) 

please sir, did I leave it here?

clause= YesNoQuestion V S O X
V= past tense/ not 3rd sing/  concept="lose"/ modifier="here" 
S= pronoun
pronoun= 1st sing subject
O= pronoun
pronoun= 3rd sing object
X= polite request/ polite address masc
X(saluta signior) YNQ(qe) S(mi) V(pa u-ci lose) O(id) X(place) (?)

Yes. I agree. The syntactic analysis is correct here.
But I have some problems with the resultant Glosa.

~puta~  - this is the word for calculated, logical
          thought. I would guess that it was
          your belief or opinion
          rather than a calculation you had done.

~kamera~ - this is the word comes from the word for
           a room, and in Glosa it still
           means room.

~u mi~ - this means mine (belonging to me). As in
               ~U-ci es u mi~ This is mine
               My is just ~mi~, you dont need too 
               mark for single number, but if you did
               you would say ~mi u~.  
               Compare marking for plural 
                   ~Plu-ci es mi plu bibli.~ 
                   These are my books

So I would say 

~Mi doxo; mi pa lose mi foto-grafi-me.~

> 
~Saluta~ - Greetings. If this is the second sentence
            that you have addressed to the man, it 
            seems a strange point to greet him.
~signor~ - Are you calling him this because he is 
           Spanish?
~u-ci~ - this. I guess you mean here ~ci~.
~lose~ - lose not leave.
~place?~ -  seems to make please? the question


I would suggest 

~Senior. Place. Qe mi pa ci linqi id?~

Saluta,
Nick

We have three functions for U(N)/PLU:

1) substitute for the article of our mother languages (whatever it
     then is in Glosa)
2) begin-of-noun-phrase-marker and
3) number-marker (singular/plural).

Ja, "mi u" is Glosa.  And it is bad in my opinion, because it
contradicts 2).  (That was certainly Syd's idea, too.)

Imagine, one wants to write a grammar book (and this should happen
soon!).  He will not be able to express a rule for U(N)/PLU, without
adding a further exception-rule for the order with possessive
pronouns.  With (many) exceptions in its grammar, Glosa cannot compete
with other IALs.

I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.

I am not sure about that.  Perhaps we should ask Wendy.  The meaning
"camera" for "kamera" is in the book "Central Glosa", p. 82.  Of
course it is meant as "camera {room}", but I think "camera {device}"
can be possible, too.  I feel, that the Glosa authors were more in
favour of getting international words -- and "camera {device}" is
international -- than in puristic avoiding of homonyms.

Yes. It would be good to hear what Wendy has to say
about about this.

I think I would be in favour of a few homonyms myself,
but my feeling is that "no homonyms" is one if the
fundamental design features of Glosa.

Saluta,
Nick

The function of the article would be more strictly one of
U-LA or U-CI or PLU-CI or PLU-LA, if I understand the
unmuddled intentions of the authors.

> 2) begin-of-noun-phrase-marker

Several other particles share that function, of course.

> 3) number-marker (singular/plural).

That's the true meaning of U/UN and PLU. As with the verbal
particles, Glosa's noun-phrase particles can be arranged in
a fairly simple paradigm, the relevant items here being:

1. case DE AD etc.
2. number U/UN PLU
3. deictic/definite CI LA

One may question whether items 2 and 3 are ordered properly,
or whether PLU-CI etc should be un-hyphenated, or the deictic
scheme should be separated from definite-ness.

Glosa should be true to its own best nature (analytic grammar and
international vocab), abandoning exceptions and inconsistent features.

> I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.

But they are all fairly easy to fix.

To relinquish control to the next generation.

    The School Master thinks that the Pupil is a new boy, who has lost his
room; thus, the Master will NOT be on the look-out for a missing camera.

    If we are trying to say:-
        "I think I've lost my camera."   
then
       ~Mi puta: mi pa lose mi foto-grafi-me.~

ought to suffice.
  % U mi [mine] is simply a make-up to strengthen the 'nouniness' of ~mi~
which is already a pronoun, anyway.  This shortage of a name for the thing,
which I own, could be covered by invoking "thing."

  Id eqa mi-ra.  =  It is my(thing).

would do the job equally well.  But ~u mi~  =  "the (of) me"   is the
current comstruction .. definitely not needed in front of a tangible like
the, above, missing camera.

*   In O.G. we had the choice of ~pensa~ and ~kogita~ for thinking.
Somehow, this ~puta~ has come into the story, and replaced the others. 
  My Latin dictionary says:-
    Puto  1.to prune; 2. a)to estimate, reckon, value, consider;
      b)to think, reflect; c)to believe, suppose.
so, it does seem an adequate word here.

>So I would say 

>
*   But we do not need to changing "thinking" to "believing", unless the
Master questions the Boy's accuracy of reporting, and the Boy finds it
necessary to assert that he really does believe that he did leave his
camera behind.
    The semi-colon does not seem, to me, to be apposite, here.
    Actually, the semi-colon is part of the story of "that" as an
impersonal pronoun, not of the 'logical' "that."

    Id es u-la ~qi~; qi seqe u nomina-verba ke habe u semi-kolon.

    It is that 'that', that follows a noun that has a semi-colon.

    This comes in two forms:-
       An habe epi-se u kapela; qi habe u pina.
       An habe epi-se u kapela; habe u pina.     (elided)

    The 'logical' "that can also be elided:-
       Mi habe nuli problema ko an vesti-auto intra plu komika kapela, sed
mi habe certa ke an kausa an-auto te habe ridi-abili feno, kron an
vesti-auto in mu.
       Mi habe nuli problema ko an vesti-auto intra plu komika kapela, sed
mi habe certa: an kausa an-auto te habe ridi-abili feno, kron an vesti-auto
in mu.                (elided)

    But this 'logical' "that" (~ke~), which seems to relate more to a verb
than a noun, can be replaced by a full colon.

*   The question of 'leaving behind' vs 'losing' is a nice distinction,
and, yes, Nick wins on points.
    Agreed, after looking at the GID, Nick is correct on the title:  senior
   =   Mr
        seniora   =   Mrs
        seniorita =   Miss
        xxxx      =   young Master  ...  probably an archaic form
    It is certainly ~ci~ not ~u-ci~ [this], but the placement is
problematical.  The final word in the sentence does have emphasis, and it
cannot be ~place~ but could be ~ci~.

      ~Place, senior: qe, mi pa linqi ci u foto-grafi-me?~   O.K.
but
      ~Place, senior: qe, mi pa linqi id, ci?~   sounds more natural.

   I would suggest that we base the Glosa Primers on some very creative,
modern language instruction books.  I suspect that the one Syd is using, as
his model, is pre-war.

Saluta,

Robin

*   Thanks Marcel,
    This is quite interesting; it was'nt my work, either.  But, it is
pretty well-written Glosa.  This is quite a mystery: is it written by one
of the Glosalistas flexing his linguistic muscles; or has some rank
outsider demonstrated that Glosa is very easy to pick up and use?
    I will write to one of the contact addresses, possibly the Socialist
Party of Great Britain.

Saluta,

Robin

But check the Basic Reference where it says -

Punctuation: 
   Colon precedes items of a list; 
          comma separates list items from each other; 
          it also occurs after a vocative expression. 

   Semicolon separates principal and subordinate 
          clauses; a clause is a group of words
          containing a finite verb.

Examples from 18 Steps 
~Fe stude: biologi, kemi.~
~Mi este sura; tu pa gene mega hedo ex tu visita; e mi
atende plu nova de tu libe-tem.~
~U-ci es u gina; tu pa du dic a.~
~U-ci es u plaka; qi tena kemi-kroma.~

And the rule about ~qi~ given is -
When 'who' or 'which' are the object of a clause they
are usually left out in English. In Glosa we always
leave them out.

So I take it that ~qi~ cannot be omitted if it is the
subject of the clause.

Saluta,
Nick

From: Robin Gaskell <rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au>
Date: Fri, 29 Mar 2002 10:59:39 +1100

Mi Plu Karo Amika,

  So, I am going to have to ammend my Website - by adding Seminar #3 to
Seminars #1 & #2.

  The questions have been raised:-
        what does a good Glosa VERB PHRASE look like, and 
        when is Glosa going to get a standardised syntax?

  Seminar #3 is going to address these questions giving answers, 'rules',
and examples.

  But I cannot, nor do I want to, sort out these details in isolation: I
ask for help from the group.
  As I understand it, Ron Clark gave the outline of structure within
phrases, and also of that between phrases, when forming sentences.
  However, people need 'rules' not guidelines; perhaps now is the time to
discover those 'rules.'

  Below, are appended two sections some might have missed .. independently
of one another, Charles and I sent in suggested sequences of word function
within the VERB PHRASE.
  Please look at them, and try them out with examples from Glosa, English,
and any other language you like.
  For example, see if you can say "He quickly very ran," or if some ''more
natural'' sequence forces itself upon you?
  Can we answer the question, 'is syntax ^hard-wired^ into the brain?';
and, if we come down in the affirmative, can we proscribe such a
regularised syntax for Glosa???

  Here are the two suggested schemas:-
==A.=========================================================
>From Charles

   And basically Glosa has only one, "U".  Not 'a' or 'the'; nor `la` or

If you don't really need a "the", sometimes it is handy to have a large
signpost telling people that the phrase, which is commencing, happens to be
a NOUN PHRASE.

    Maybe, in this imperfect world, we can forge a perfect language ...

    As far as I'm concerned, Glosa's phrase sequences are spelled out in
the rules of the Functional Grammar of English.
    The sequence within Noun Phrases is described in Seminar #2 in my
website; and the sequence within Verb Phrases was attempted independently
by Kevin and me during the past month, on Glosalist.

    Blow me down, some years ago I attempted to float a symbol system for
the 'reading' of syntax structure in a sentence - independent of the words.
 Was I ahead of my time, or does a symbol system  demonstrating syntax not
make sense!?

    What about members of this Mailing List dishing up some Glosa sentences
they just cannot force into a regularised syntax!!??
    We'll all do our best to bend them straight.

>> I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.
>
>But they are all fairly easy to fix.
*
   Ron Clark hated the idea of forcing yet another Grammar Book onto the
world.  He said that Prescriptive Grammars were against nature.
   And he had the impression that he was creating a 'natural', Planned
Language: a language that had a logic of its own .. built in.

   So, were he able to see how things would bog down, here on Glosalist,
might he not have tried just a little harder to indicate the  rules
inherent in this natural system?

>> Perhaps we should ask Wendy.
>
>To relinquish control to the next generation.

*  Bit of a nasty one.
   However, I concede that Wendy:
      does not discus developments, within Glosa, through this List;
      may not have studied a lot of Linguistics;
      seems somewhat resistent to change; and
      has not told people of her plans for the future of Glosa.

   But, she:
      is the one recognised, remaining authoritative voice on Glosa;
      wants to see Glosa disseminated via the Net, but is possibly unsure
as to how this might best be achieved; 
      holds charity registration of the Glosa Education Organisation;
      has the longest time-involvement of anyone working with Glosa;
      holds the database of non-Net supporters of Glosa; and 
      can be educated ... on linguistics, educational methods, and business
techniques.

   So, taking all of these factors into account, I wish to work through
Wendy, and under her aegis, however, at the same time, 'upgrading' her
Linguistic status and knowlege of the wider world of Planned Language
Research .. to help her reach the pinnicle of Auxiliary Language
performance, so that she might be the prime spokes-person for Glosa, when
the world eventually asks for our Exemplar.

   Wishful thinking ... maybe.

   However, Wendy has already been to Brussels to represent Glosa, has met
Glosa representatives, from Africa, in Verona, and has presented Glosa at
various book fairs and educational conferences in Europe, so she is the
recognisable and acknowleged 'front person' for Glosa.
   There are just a few difficulties with the Glosalist appearing to go off
at a tangent from the basic language.  One example is "ke", another is the
production of new dictionaries.  Even still, Wendy would like to see the
vocabulary stabilised and standardised, and I am sure that she would like
to see a rash of new stories and articles published on the Internet - once
the challenges of regularised vocab and syntax are met.

Saluta,

Robin 
  P.S.  At 65, I do not form part of the 'next generation'.   R.G.

Robin hath said:

By "article" is meant a particle to indicate definiteness versus
indefiniteness. Some languages have a definite article, the lack of
which indicates indefiniteness; the reverse strategy is also attested.
If "U/UN" were Glosa's true article (which it is not) it would translate
as English "the" or "a/an", but certainly not both. It is actually just
the mark of singular number for its associated noun, though as a happy
side-effect one also can infer the presence of a noun phrase.

> The U-LA or U-CI or PLU-CI or PLU-LA quartet are the impersonal pronouns

It is well-known that the definite article generally evolves from
"deictics" or "demonstratives" (or whatever term you prefer). Clearly
in Glosa's case the purely "deictic" particles CI and LA are adjoined
to the purely singular/plural particles to compose the demonstratives.
Since I can translate "the" and "a/an" using them, and since the Glosa
documentation *does* refer to them as "articles", I'll continue to
call U-LA and brethren the nearest thing to true articles in G.

Enough given above? It's just a standard linguistic term.

> Yep: Glosa ought to have regular syntax, and avoid exceptions.

What I said means so much more than that.

Why not just study English instead of Glosa, then? More rewarding.

> Was I ahead of my time, or does a symbol system  demonstrating syntax not
> make sense!?

Parse trees make perfect sense, and have since the 1950's.
The problem with analytic langs (as opposed to the synthetic type)
is their relatively complex syntax, so claiming that "Glosa has
no grammar" is an admission of guilt, it's not a plus at all.
Try to define it, and the inconsistencies are exposed.

>>> Perhaps we should ask Wendy.

>> To relinquish control to the next generation.

> Bit of a nasty one.

Admittedly. But both Jesperson and Wahl foresaw the need to turn "their"
langs over to a committee to continue it after them. In fact they asked
for feedback from the beginning, and accepted many suggested modifications.
(Jesperson was the most famous linguistic scientist of his time; he invented
the IPA, and was head of Ido for many years prior to his move to Novial,
BTW.) The great ones can tolerate criticism, and change.

I disagree. In order to be able to quickly read Glosa text,
I need to know when I am shifting from NP to VP and back.

Some languages use suffixes, so by looking at a single word
you know what kind of phrase it belongs to. Glosa doesn't
do that.

Some languages use specific words in specific ways. This
word is _always_ a verb. That word is _always_ an
adjective. Glosa doesn't do that.

Thus, when you have a string of words, like ~pote auxi
dona~, you have no idea whether they are NP, VP, or some
combination. The ONLY ways to figure it out are 1) guess,
or 2) have marker words like ~nu~ and ~plu~.

Perhaps I'm being overly simplistic, but can we get along
with just two rules for verb phrases?

1. Start a verb phrase with pa/nu/fu.
2. Each word must modify the rest of the verb phrase.

Why would ja/ne have to go before pa/nu/fu? Seems like a
needless exception.

Do we really have to restrict the sequence of these? Is
there really anything wrong with something like:

...nu du ne sio ha...

> > 7. adverbs

These are covered by my second rule, above. This second
rule also prevents something like "quickly very run",
because "very" modifies "quickly run", not just "run".

Basically it's just: particles and modifiers first, full words last.
That's a good place to start, but there are linguistic tendencies
gravitating toward a more detailed paradigm. Like:

> Why would ja/ne have to go before pa/nu/fu? Seems like a
> needless exception.

English goes with the "did/does/will not" order, so maybe Glosa
wants the same. But we also like to put "not" immediately prior
to the thing negated. Often there are competing forces within
a language (and Optimality Theory addresses this) ... I can't
predict what order Glosa would converge to, so I just guessed.
One problem with your first rule is that oriental language
speakers will specify aspect but not tense.

>> 3. modals: SIO, ...
>> 4. aspects: DU, HA(?)
>> 5. passive GE(?)
>> 6. verboids

> Do we really have to restrict the sequence of these? Is
> there really anything wrong with something like:
>
> ...nu du ne sio ha...

That gets difficult to parse without some combinatorial restrictions.
I think something sensible would evolve in practice if there were
a true speech community using G. In your example, HA and DU are
opposite aspects that would never co-occur. But I can imagine
"he shouldn't be driving" rendered with "... nu ne sio du ...",
fitting Bickerton's Tense-Mode-Aspect creole auxiliary order.

>> 7. adverbs
>> 8. the true verb

> These are covered by my second rule, above. This second

I worry about (both kinds of) adverbs though:
They can certain(ly) very fast get very mess(y).
Also can't figure out passives and a few others.

But when it's all finished evolving, I think a paradigm is the
easiest way to show the whole grammar thing, even to beginners.
There would be one for verb phrases, another for noun phrases.
(I use pull-down boxes on a web page to generate sample phrases.)

2) ~nu~, ~pa~, ~fu~, ~nu pa~, 
                ~nu fu~, ~fu pa~, ~pa fu~
3) ~sio~   
4) ~du~

10) ~ci~, ~intra~, ~ana~, ~qestio~, ~fobo~, etc
11)  repeat of 7)

Guessing is good! It's what we do with the many ambiguous
sentences that can occur in English. Mostly, we don't even
notice we  are doing it!

I don't think it is wrong to include as many markers as you
like. I am just against a rule to make it compulsory, as that
just makes Glosa hard to get right, because it is not "natural".
If it were "natural" then, we wouldn't need a rule.

One can say that syntax is hard-wired in the brain, in the sense that
every language has a syntax. But not every language has the same
syntax. What is hard-wired is that there are certain possible patterns,
and certain impossible patterns. For language X the pattern is A,
and for language Y the pattern is the not A. And the pattern we learn
as children, seems to us to be the "natural" pattern.

Interglossa had a very rigidly defined syntax, which was clear but made 
it seem cold and clinical and rather boring. Glosa went to the other 
extreme and was very flexible. All sorts of possibilities were tried out,
and some were kept, some were thrown out, and some revisions
were made over the years of development.

What one needs to do, is to look at real sentences as they are now, 
and to draw out the rules that underlie the constructions, rather than 
invent a logical framework and try to force Glosa into it.

Saluta,
Nick

   Pushing the 'rule' backwards from the plural ~ ... mi plu bibli,~  we
could get a construction, ~ ... mi u bibli.~  But there is no possible
reason for using the ''singular'' marker, ~U~, if we already have the
situation covered with the "singular" ~MI.~
   ~U mi ...~ is a gross tautology; ~U-mi ...~, on the other hand, is an
acceptable special form.

   EG  Sue:    Na, singo-pe, nece habe u bibli, pro u-ci exercisa.
       Bill:   U-tu es ci; qo-lo mi bibli?
       Sue:    Na pote simul lekto u-mi; e seqe, kron na ergo ko un exercisa,

use a completely regularised sequence of functions within the Verb Phrase,

  Can Glosa accomodate such 'human' needs, without compromising its
syntactical nicities: I sincerely hope so.  In fact, if we ever do find the
brain's inner laws of syntax, I believe that such variable placement - for
emphasis - will be part of the story.

understandings  of Glosa's grammar - by observation of the language in
action - a year, or so ago.
   However we ought to be clear as to whether we want to write a
prescriptive grammar or a more post-scriptive one.  If we lay down the laws
of syntax as a prescription, then we will be suggesting that people MUST
follow such laws, unthinkingly, even thogh the resulting sentences might
FEEL wrong.
   For this reason, I have implored people to actually use Glosa to write
stories, treatises and poems, or even boring prose, simply to let the
"words do the talking."  Try to express things in Glosa according to what
appear to be the 'rules' of syntax; then, when sentences don't seem to work
out right, recast them, and try to find a more human form of expression,
while maintaining, or expanding, a rule-based schema.
   I am probably trying to say that Linguists should not compile grammars:
the people should.  Once enough has been said, naturally, by the people,
then Linguists can be called in to deduce the 'rules.'  At the moment,
Glosa might be seen to be a Linguist top-heavy, and communicator
under-weight language.

   We have strange word categories, like ~KE~, which Ron gathered
originally from Esperanto.  And we have strange grammatical constructions,
like the PASSIVE VOICE which suits a lot of people's brain-waves, and ought
to be given room in Glosa.  Also, we are just discovering the possessive
pronouns: these are popular enough to be part of Glosa, too.
   And, all that's before even thinking of the "feel" of language, or the
"Universal Grammar of Syntax."

*  Not a problem, if all can be explained.  And I feel it can: the 'small
box' in a house, and the 'small box' with a lens, can be seen as synonyms,
but I think they shouldn't; I believe that we have a 'metaphor' situation,
here.
   This comes down to a question of which came first: have there been "rooms"
for thousands of years, or have there been "cameras" for at least two
hundred years?  If a photographic camera is like a small room with a curved
sperical glass where the window ought to be, then the photographic device
can easily be seen as a metaphor.  In Glosa, as with synonyms, we are
trying to keep metaphorical usages to a minimum, but sometimes the metaphor
is a lot easier than the 'descriptive' Glosa term.  And, if everyone knows
the metaphorical use, then why would we try to pressurise people to adopt a
super-special Glosa word, instead.  I feel we should avoid the tendency to
become a Glosa version of the Academie Francaise, which has to find a
special French-language version for everything.

Robin

*   Now I know where you got these unusual sentences from!

    Did you get your camera back, Sid?

    As with Glosa, Spanish or any language, the thing to aim at is not the
individual words, but to try to get the 'lilt' of the language, and to try
to THINK IN THE LANGUAGE.
    What does it feel like to put words together in the particular way of
the natives?!  Spanish, or whever see a logic in the way they speak (not
write), and it is this logic that we need to go for in our learning of a
particular language.
    My highly intelligent Chinese mate, while living in my spare bedroom,
used to listen to talk-back radio, and mimicked the different voices and
their vocal inflections - as their contributions came across the radio.  In
China, he had learnt American English; by the time he had spent a month of
his spare time repeating talk-back radio, he was speaking Australian English.
    This should work with Spanish radio; and, when we get it up and
running, Glosa radio.

Go with the Flow, I always say,

    I am collecting all of these ideas into a "Seminar #3" subdirectory.

    Have you or any others been thinking about the story that goes with
such schema, to give anyone an idea about how they can make it all work.
    My thought is to start with a simple three-part sentence - subject,
verb, object - and to build up the Verb Phrase progressively, so that one
by one the bits fall into place as the VP grows in complexity.

    Oh yes, I must add that I do like to push the ideas about in real,
imaginable situations, so that the idea of a sterile Glosa text is lost.
IE with EGs.

*  This looks like a good list, Nick.
   I am please to see we agree on the absence of P-o-S markers.  I know
that this was the clear intention of the Glosa authors.

   - I am going back through old downloads to see what I missed -

   Many items on your list are still hazy, and not set in concrete, but
they could be worked on .. though not endlessly.

   When I last sought authoritative work on the subtle level of universal
syntax rules I did not get far - I might try again.  Then, this could be a
first for Glosa: maybe these syntax universals have not been tackled by the
Linguists, yet.

   Punctuation is reasonably thought out in Glosa, with some dislike of the
semi-colon - on beauty points, I fear.  But, in Glosa, which does rely on
word order and structure within sentences, I believe that punctuation is
much more important than it is, say, in English.  For this reason, I
believe that the writer should use suitable punctuation to indicate the
start of phrases and clauses - where an absence of punctuation could cause
ambiguity.  In English, the current fashion is against using commas
'sculpturally', but I think we cannot afford such whimsy in a language with
syntax-based grammar.

   More work needed, with example needed to demonstrate compounding.  Use
or non-use of the hyphen should be clear-cut.  Possibly a special sort of
grouping mark could be used to show that a set of unhyphenated substantives
comprised a compound.
  EG  He turned on the _wind monitoring hurricane detector_ just in time to
predict that the next tornado was only two hours away.

   THe rule of thumb on phrase markers is that a comma indicates the start
of a new phrase - but this is only essential in complicated sentences, and
the comma can be elided in simple sentences.  The other idea is that the
next stage up, the semi-colon, acts as a guidepost to the start of a
clause.  This is a reasonable rule, but, where an excess of semi-colons
might seem a little heavy-handed, commas will often handle the start of a
new clause.  If a standard rule can be derived, then it would be a good
idea, but we must always leve people the option of eliding non-essential
punctuation.

   It goes without saying that I cannot start pulling your leg in polite
society, if some present do not know that I am using an English idiom.
However, it is a bit high-handed of us to rule idioms out completely,
especially if they are the point of a joke, or necessary to give colour to
a story.  As long as there is a way of indicating the presence of
non-literal language, then people will attempt to read an idiom in context,
or will know to reach for their dictionary of idiomatic phrases.
  EG.  Joe pa dice ke an pa du es ^trakto mu plu poda^ tem u pa horo, e u
holo history pa es ge-face ex an.

   This clear definition of words has taken up far too much time, already,
and should be finalised before the middle of this year.  Wow, did I say
that!?  Looks like those of us active in this are will have to really
complete the job.

Saluta,

Robin

   No markers or sign-posts of any kind, but the old S-V-O rule takes the
day.  Do we need to talk of "zero-marking" here?

    ~An don a mi auxi.~
   Does it still make sense, even though the AUXI has changed teams, and

    ~An don auxi a mi.~
   This is just another understandable (therefore acceptable) version.
There are still no noun markers, verb phrase indicators, or punctuation
marks between phrases.

     He helps me to write the sentences.

   Possibly Charles, you and I are plugged into different systems of
grammatical analysis.  I trust that we can make it a complementary
relatioship, getting the best out of both of us - for Glosa's sake.

   At a pinch I could say the were 'particles' that often acted as 'phrase
markers'.

   However the need to see sentences as collections of phrass, rather than
collections of words is quite true.  Contrary to popularly held belief, the
phrase, not the word, is the unit of meaning in a sentence.
   This idea was tested in the real world through creation of the
sentence-building game _KrostVerb_ (or "Skribble").  Unlike crosswords and
"Scrabble", which criss-cross single letters, my game jumped to the third
level of organisation, and criss-crossed phrases.  The game, which was
designed to be a Glosa teaching tool in Uganda, never quite made it to
Africa, but the English-language version worked very well.  More on
KrostVerb if anyone is interested.

*  While we talk glibly about Syntax, and treat Glosa as the guessing game:
Where-do-I-put-that-word, there is a whole world of Semantics out there,
waiting for Glosa to discover it.  While Ron Clark concentrated on the
visible Syntax element of grammar, I suspect that he put the element of
Semantics on the ^back burner^ for a ^rainy day^.

   Es [to be] is just one of a number of concepts that are encapsulated
into words, and conveniently categorised with other words that seem to
function in the same way.  But we fall into difficulty if we are to treat
all 'doing and being' words in the same way.  The actual concept behind a
word will often rule just how we use it. 
   Yet I agree with Ron Clark's principle: ''the listener comes halfway
towards the speaker'' when making sense of what is said.
   In fact the listener, or reader, brings much to the commuincation
process, otherwise no transmission of information could take place.  So,
this all leads to the idea that we do not have to, no should we, define the
language's usage very precisely to its learners.

Robin

   My finding is that I do not simply transfer my normal English sentence
structure into Glosa, although some uncritical types have claimed it to be
so.  In fact, well-written Glosa does 'map' almost word for word onto
acceptable English sentences, BUT well-written English does not always map
onto properly formed Glosa sentences.
   Thus, I find that Glosa syntax is a sub-set of English syntax, and, as
such, IS more rigorous than that of English ... and, accordingly, more simple.

I think that ~mi u bibli~ is the underlying form.

Compare - ~epi u tabla~ = ~epi tabla~.
and ~mi mo bibli~ [my one book].

That ~mi~ is "singular", doesn't seem to be relevant.
As ~na~ is "plural", what does ~na bibli~ mean?

It is an interesting question as to whether ~bibli~ is
"singular" by default. If so, then why do we ever
need to use ~u~? Or if like "tense", once we have
established the "number" of a noun, we can leave
it unmarked.

Saluta,
Nick

> ~An don a mi auxi.~

What did he give to my aid? (Confusion of MI as a possessive.)
Also, it would be heard as "An dona mi auxi" if spoken. And
then I'd have to ask, who did he give my help to? Because
*semantically* the verb "give" connects up-to-3 noun phrases.

> ~An don auxi a mi.~

There is a very clear preposition to mark the verb-to-object transition.
And again, the pronoun AN could be a possessive and the DON(A) could
be an adjective: "His given/giving help to me". What you'd really say
in good clear Glosa would be "An pa auxi mi."

You rely too heavily on semantics to resolve all the syntactic
ambiguities resulting from over-agressive elision of particles.
Whenever an auxlanger appeals to semantics to resolve ambiguity,
I recognize an emperor lacking clothes. Have some mercy for the
innocent readers, and use the d{at}mned particles.

I didn't understand GE, asked for clarification, got the answer it is
the same as in English. In English it is used both for some sort of
past tense/aspect and as a participle. Thus it can be called ambiguous.
And it's much the same with DU: is it used as the "other" participle?

I have never studied German and so have no intuition about GE,
but I'm quite sure it is *not* etymologically "get" or "gain".
AFAICT, Glosa DU = English "-ing" and Glosa GE = English "-ed".

One problem with fusing the participles and aspects is that you now
*must* specify tense to indicate where a verb phrase begins. Asians
will not like that (being used to specifying aspect without tense).

At any rate, there are no languages lacking some means of expressing
both aspect and tense. Glosa uses FU NU PA for tense, and apparently
GE and DU for both aspect *and* participles. I withdraw my previous
suggestion of HA for the perfective aspect, already performed by GE.
(I like the idea of having a present/active participle, at least ...)

> Please give example of apparently conflicting rules

What rules? Glosa still has no grammar.

Now please explain the passive voice of Glosa, since I can't figure
that out either. I hope you won't say it's just the same overloading
of "ES = to be" as in English. I had thought GE was involved somehow.

Perhaps. Yes, I can figure out the meanings of all of these
simple sentences. But in every case it was the SECOND path
I tried that yielded the correct result. If I am trying to
read quickly, or parse spoken text in real time, that's a
problem.

~Un andra~ means "a man", whereas ~An~ would me "he". I am
willing to omit the leading NP marker, because most
sentences start with a NP. The only problems I have with
this are sentences like ~pluvi~ ("it is raining"), and
~veni!~ (command). I would like to see an imperative twin
of ~qe~ to clear up the latter. The former seems to be rare
enough and involve such simple sentences that it doesn't
seem to be a problem.

The ~nu~ is VERY helpful in the sentence above, as shown by
my earlier parsing attempts.

I don't like or use the ~te~, so I agree it doesn't help
here.

I am willing to come half way (or more) towards a speaker
to understand the meaning. I have a hard time coming more
than half way just to parse the sentence.

Karo plu Glosa-pe,

Some interesting NPs from "Language Planning" to
analyse.

~English mero de mikro English - French marsu lexiko~

~U logika ge-face verba-lista~

~u nu ma de sati verba semani lauda alo no-lauda~

~u mo-kilo verba limita~


Grammatical Errors?

A prima vista posi id feno u no-spe ergo de face u
verba-lista; qi fu sati panto nece volu de
interkomunika; sed inklude ne ma de, posi, u kilo basi
verba. 

I guess ~u kilo basi verba~ is not a valid NP, 
as ~verba~ is plural here.

Should it be ~mo kilo basi verba~ or just
~kilo basi verba~?
Would ~plu kilo basi verba~ mean 
"several thousand basic words"?


~Kron na vide u difere inter "thread - twine - cord -
string - rope - tow"; na solo kumu nima epi nima pro
qo es, a fini, u metri-difere.~

Shouldn't this be ~pro qod es~?
[~qod~ = "that which~]

*  This is, I believe, the nub of the problem!
   For reasons of Glosa's:-
      lack of P-o-S markers on the actual words,
      lack of inbuilt "redundancy,"
      optionality of Noun-Marker particles and Verb-Marker particles, 
I consider that it is not simply good sense to edit, and possibly revise,
Glosa prose, but nigh on a necessity.
   Needless to say, such post-writing editing ought to be preceded by the
pre-writing re-think.  This very first stage of Glosa communication
involves running the phrases, of the intended sentence, through the mind
prior to committing them to type/sound.

N.B.  This is the missing phase: were we learning a pre-existing language,
we would allow ourselves to be inundated by cassette recordings of the
SPOKEN language, and would thus receive conditioning that automatically
caused us to use the common syntax of the language.
      However, we have only articles from PGN plus a few children's stories
to act as examples of Glosa prose, and there are a few mis-usages even
within this meagre corpus; as well as that, we must make up for the lack of
childhood learning of Glosa, and need to do .. consciously .. what children
unconsciously do, when learning a language. 
      So, in running our Glosa phrases through our heads before sending
them to this List, we are mentally checking them for all of the things that
children take years, of trial and error, to achieve.
      Worse than that, it would seem that Glosa's syntax options are not,
as yet, ^set in concrete.^  So, in writing Glosa, we are still part of the
'research process.'

*   1. Yes, we can make unwarranted assumptions about the reader's ability
to follow our train of thought.
    2. The acronym PoS (or P-o-S) was invented, originally, to cover the
'part of speech' markers that are attached to words, such as -LY, -ED, -S
in English, terminal vowels in Esperanto, and possibly Verb inflections and
Noun suffixes, in general.  
     The PoS acronym could, by general consent, be extended to include the
u/plu\pa/nu/fu particles, but I suspect that this would be building a
confusion into the already well-packed concept.
     My preference is to keep the concept of PoS markers as describing what
Glosa has NOT got, while using the NP/VP marker labels to cover the concept
of Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase markers, which Glosa HAS.
     And while I am convinced that U/PLU often has no semantic meaning -
and all they do is denote the start of NP - I am not yet convinced that
tense/aspect particles, which do change the timing of the action of a
sentence, can accurately be described as VP markers: although they do, in
effect, indicate the start of a VP, 
this is not their prime function.

*  A. In simple sentences it would represent an unwanted redundancy to use
both a pronoun and U/PLU.
  EG  Mi feli pa bibe u lakti.
      U feli pa bibe u lakti.
      U mi feli pa bibe u lakti.*
      Mi u feli pa bibe u lakti.*
   B. Yes, despite Ron Clark's original dictate that any word can function
as any part of speech, we have had to add the moderating phrase, 'within
reason', to make the statement rational.
 IE  Any word can function, within  reason, as any part of speech.
   C. In Old Glosa, the ES was 'extended' to ESO to create the lexicon
entry,  ESO = essence.  While ~eso~ is neater than the G.I.D. ~esentia~,
the new word overcame the criticism that a P-o-S marker had been introduced
to change the 'verb' to a 'noun'.

Robin

    We could put the question to Wendy.
    Please note, I will use the 'man-in-the-street' logic here,
and will take a guess that yer average pedestrian will not bother to put in
an extra word for which he can see no functional purpose.
So, I too, will ^vote with my feet^ and always elide the ~u~ when talking
about "my book."

>Compare - ~epi u tabla~ = ~epi tabla~.
>and ~mi mo bibli~ [my one book].
>
*   Well, ~epi tabla~ is telegrammtic, and possibly a 'North country' style
of Glosa;  ~epi u tabla~ could probably be called "educated Glosa."
    The  ~mi mo bibli~ [my one book]  example shows that in this case
English and Glosa syntax and semantics are identical.
    There is one book, and one of me: I can, if the situation demands it,
stress that it is my only book; alternatively, if it is just a book, but it
is mine, I can simply say so.

     Mi mo bibli   =  My one book
     Mi bibli      =  My book       BUT
     Mi u bibli   --- My the book   make little sense in either language.

    I suspect that we are getting caught up with the concept of "agreement."  
    In French, the determinant agrees in number and gender with the noun.
Even in English, we have a sort of 'agreement' 
  "Three books"  vs  "One book"  ...and even
  "He goes"    while   "They go"
   In both French and English we can interpret the situation as a form of
"redundancy," with one bit of the sentence backing up info in another part
of the sentence.
   There is NO AGREEMENT in Glosa: plurality in one word is not shown in
another.
  ~Tri bibli~   vs   ~Mo bibli  ... Number is NOT shown in ~bibli.~
  ~An ki~ and  ~Mu ki~   ... The ~KI~ gives NO idea of the Subject.

   I admit that Glosa's lack of agreement could be seen as a Linguistic
weakness.  In plain terms, this means that the 'number' attached to a
possessive pronoun refers ONLY to the person(s) it replaces, and NOT to the
quantity of the objects the person(s) own.

>That ~mi~ is "singular", doesn't seem to be relevant.
>As ~na~ is "plural", what does ~na bibli~ mean?
>
*   ~mi~ is singular, and relates to the PERSON only: it give no
information about the number of things belonging to that one person; there
is no agreement.
     ~mi bibli~ as in English both words carry singularity:
              = one book + one person
     ~mi plu bibli~ as in English the presence of more the one book forces
us to raise the object from the ^resting state^ ~bibli~
which can be read as ~(u) bibli~  to the plural state - denoted with the
additional "-S" in English, and indicated with the additional particle
~PLU~ in Glosa.  In Glosa the number of books and the number of books DO
NOT get mixed together: they are quite separate pluralities:-
             |        Books              |
             |___________________________|
             | one      |   two or more  |
_____________|__________|________________|
        one  | mi bibli |  mi plu bibli  |
People  _____|__________|________________|
        two  | na bibli |  na plu bibli  |
_____________|__________|________________|

*   This is a shrewd observation.
    Yes ~bibli~ on its own can be little other than singular, but whether
one telegramicises the sentences to omit further use of ~u~
is probably a matter of style and/or expediency.
    On the other hand, eliding subsequent use of ~plu~, once plurality had
been established could be more tricky: the object could appear to keep
changing its state of number, so it might be prudent to continue to add the
plural particle.

   In context, the others would do, but are open to ambiguity, as Charles
points out.Yes, tense particles and NP indicators are nice, but by
repeating the pronoun, ~an~, both of the disputed sentences, above, would
have been disambiguated:-

   ~An don auxi a mi.~    --->    ~An don an auxi a mi.~

   ~An don a mi auxi.~    --->    ~An don a mi an auxi.~

  P.S. I disagree over semantics: I do not see it as a weak excuse; but I
do see it as a significant, but missing, part of the Glosa story.  My guess
is that Auxlangers question its relevance because they put it in the ^too
hard basket^.    R.G.

   Regarding DU, this is an abbreviation of DURA [to continue], and is
usually found as a tense particle giving continuous aspect.  However, as
Charles points out, it should also be the prefix for the Present
Participle, preferably hyphenated (DU-).
  EG  Intra u parka, an du kursi peri u dendra.
      In the park, he is running around the tree.

   Glosa DU gives 'verbs' continuous aspect [= -ing], and DU- converts

adjective.  GE- [= -ed] converts words into the Past Participle.

Which would imply that Glosa is, for any speaker that has
not already heard/read reams of Glosa prose, inappropriate
for spoken speech. This does not affect my primary Glo/sa
purpose, which is distributing information via web
(written) information. However, it does raise concerns

I increasingly wonder if we don't need an explicit VP
marker for use where you don't wish to use a tense word or
where the tense word wouldn't come first.

Back to my original sentence: ~mi volu auxi~ (I want to
help). It seems that it is nearly _impossible_ to use auxi
as a verb, because it will be interpreted as a noun.
Instead, you must say ~mi volu dona auxi~. It bothers me
somewhat to have a word that could perfectly legitimately
mean "to help" unusuable in that role.

Punctuation:-
Punctation separates. We separate "tri" and "na" slightly because we expect S 
first , the comma tells us that S is not where we would expect. The "." 
separates the sentence definitely from what follows. In my sentence, I want 
the S V and O to flow smoothly and without interuption, "qi ....... 
intereste" is part of O being a post modifier of "Ronda", the conjunction 
"qi" joins the clauses however the ";" separates them! The "qi" and the ";"

> However, it does raise concerns about use as a complete IAL.

It's always necessary to revise/edit/polish writing.
And spoken fluency requires constant daily practice.
Can't have a language without a speech community,
but the reverse is true also, which is a problem.
So the duty of the Datuval (language designer) is
to provide people a very solid and simple grammar
plus starter vocabulary ... then let go (release).
Glosa hasn't evolved that far yet.

> I am trying to remember to use the NP/VP terminology
> instead of PoS.

I think of POS as also standing for "piece of s#!t" because it
represents the outmoded grammar-school grammar. But, Glosa
really does have the bare theoretical minimum of 2 word classes:
full lexical words, versus grammatical particles. Some of them
straddle the fuzzy middle, so I suggested that all particles
be shorter (3 letters or less) than all full-words (4 or more).

> I increasingly wonder if we don't need an explicit VP
> marker for use where you don't wish to use a tense word or
> where the tense word wouldn't come first.

The particle "i" is used in Tok Pisin, though disappearing
from common use. In Glosa any of several "auxiliary" verbs
indicate the start of the verb phrase; similarly for NPs.
But not if those particles (e.g. DU and GE) are also
used as derivational affixes (e.g., as participles).
With poor design, good implementation is impossible.

Verbs in every language are created by noun incorporation,
that is their essential nature. Only auxiliary particles
can carry verbiness (can't say "verbosity" here). So the
natural solution is "mi vol auxi" where VOL is some sort
of verbal mood particle. For fun or extra discredit:
How about a vocabulary of 100% bisyllabic natural roots,
particles created by elision of the cosmetic final vowel?
Hmm, could reserve -a for verbs, -e for nouns, ...

Hi Sid,
  Glad you found all the lost items again.
  I'd put it down to the 'organic' way Spanish architecture works, and I
might guess the street-plans in medieval towns were constructed as mazes.
  At least you've been there, and have lived to tell the tale.

Happy Travelling,

Interestingly, earlier today I updated my Glo lists to
distinguish between ~ad~ (toward [direction]) and ~to~ (at
[position]). I realized that the "at" in ~ad~ is like in
"the ball came at me quickly", not like in "I am at my
office".

I would have thought that ~kron~ would be "at a time",
rather than ~tem~. If you're talking about one specific
moment in time, anyway.

~tem meso noktu~ = around midnight (literally, during the
middle part of the night)

~kron meso noktu~ = at midnight

Ja?

Kevin

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 6 Apr 2002 22:19:23 -0800 (PST)

I have tentatively added my first non-Glosa word to Glo:
~susta~, meaning: sustain, support, prop (support), hold up
(support)

Unfortunately, the only GID word even close to this concept
is ~tena~, and ~tena~ is overloaded with too many meanings:

1. clutch; grip; hold (1); restrain (1)
2a. hold (2), keep; contain; stock (store); preserve (1);
2b. conservation; maintain; retain; preserve (2); 
3. restrain (2); 
4. support; sustain; uphold

[I've listed words twice when their intended meaning is
ambiguous]

Also, ~tena~ is very close to the spanish 'tener', which is
to hold. I would prefer to avoid using this "false friend"
for sustain.

I'm open to other ideas, but I haven't found any reasonable
alternative to ~susta~. I am especially interested in any
alternatives that might be closer to Greek or Latin.

Side Question: How do you (the collective group) feel about
me posting Glo messages to this Glosa list?
1. Appropriate and/or interesting
2. Irrelevant and/or boring, but acceptable
3. Annoying and/or inappropriate

Kevin

I think this is to do with the semantics of ~volu~, which
has the implication of wanting to receive something,
rather than to the syntax.

~Mi volu aqa.~ [I want (some) water.]
~Mi volu auxi.~ [I want (some) help.]
~Mi volu bibe.~ [I want to drink.]
~Mi volu dona auxi.~ [I want to help.]

Compare ~tende~

~Mi tende bibe.~ [I intend to drink.]
~Mi tende auxi.~ [I intend to help.]
~Mi tende gene auxi.~ [I intend to be helped.]

    I will actually buy Linguistic books that have "syntax" in the title,
to research the 'Universal Grammar' situation .. to find out how academic

continue the Interglossa trend, but then decided to ^go back to the

a few words, "All sorts of possibilities were tried out", take it from me,

like trying to stand on quicksand.  The whole of the Eighties was an
uncomfortable decade for Glosa supporters.

*   I am very glad to read this.
    Yes, Nick has put it into a nutshell.
    There is only one snag: before we look at the corpus of written Glosa,
to analyse it academically, we should also have tried to get the 'feel' of
the language - from the inside - by attempting to write Glosa prose.
    This is one skill that I exhort Glosa-pe to practise and develop -
prior to making pronouncements on how they think the language ought to be.
    Even if some of us spell it ~verbi~ and others ~verba~, such
idiosyncracies need not stop us from working on the where the word for
"word" goes in a phrase, and what the Glosa-user can do with the "word"
concept.
    Here I ^lay a Joker on the table.^  Ever since Ron declared Glosa to be
a "concept language", and I absorbed this idea, there have been continual
criticisms of the idea - in that many have said a language cannot be
decribed as a 'concept language, like Chinese.'  This barrage of criticism
has not stopped me from thinking of lexical items in Glosa as
"concept/words."  So, I resurrect this idea for the consideration of those
who have not heard it before.
    There are solid objects and less tangible qualities in this world; and
there are written/spoken words, which have been set up as symbols for us to
use to manipulate the ideas related to to these real-world events and objects.
    Some languages imply a fairly concrete relatioship between the
tangibles and intangibles of our experience, and the symbols used to
describe them.  Other languages suggest that their symbols can be taken as
more abstract representations of the real-world, and are, hence, more fluid
in their relationships between experiential things and the symbols that
represent them.  If such a spectrum of languages, from concrete to abstact,
does, in fact, exist, then Glosa is at the extreme 'abstract' end 
of this spectrum.
     For those who are offended by the Abstract/concrete Spectrum theory, I
duly ^remove my Joker from the table.^  For others, I invite you to look at
languages with which you are familiar, and to see if you percieve any 
differentiation between them in the degree to which they have the quality
of 'abstraction' built into their structures.

     I suspect that a consideration of the quality of the symbolism
inherent in words is critical to our activities in attempting to place
these word/symbols into some syntactic order.

*   I hope that there is a sentence structure paradigm just waiting at the
next corner, ready to jump out at Kevin, and grab him!
    Glosa is not supposed to be as confusing as Kevin finds it, and nor,
from my experience, is it.  Having met Ron Clark in 1977, and maintained
contact with the authors ever since, I would certainly  soon have given up
Glosa, and taken up another hobby, had my experience been as Kevin's.
    I suppose that a love of language, or even a knowlege of good phrase
and clause formation in English, would make all the difference.  It is my
belief that idealised Glosa has classic phrase structure and clause
structure.  Ron did select elements of language from different linguistic
sources to meld them into a 'language of best fit', and this is what Glosa
is now supposed to be: best sounding, most recognisable vocabulary, with
most rational spelling, and the best sentence structure, all capped by the
simplest of grammatical forms. 
    Getting back to "best sentence structure", which is where we came in,
this was perceived as being that of English.  I hasten to add that English
sentence structure was not chosen for Glosa because of Ron and Wendy's
nationality, but because, on objective grounds, the structure of sentences
in English comes out as being the most logical.
    I must add that all vernacular English does not have logically written
sentences.  However, in well written English, it is possible to use the
sentence structure to convey all nuances of meaning.
    
    Being curious about this, I asked myself could any mechanism have been
at work, to cause the present language of the British Isles to become more
logical than the host of other national languages.  On reflection, I mused
that the successive waves of invaders into Britain had resulted in the
imposition of many language tradition on the people of England.  After
thinking about it I percieved an evolutionary mechanism at work:-
   . With Briton, Germanic, Norse, Roman, and subsequent, colonial inputs,
the vocabulary was greatly enriched, while the population experienced a
number of grammatical systems;
   . By a process of natural selection operating at levels of both
vocabulary and grammar, the people ultimately decided which vocabulary and
grammar they would retain;
   . On a mutual exclusion principle, not all words introduced to England
would be retained, and similarly the remaining grammar would be a blend of
the best of the structures that had been introduced;
   . In this evolutionary story, "best" means most comfortable and most
useful.
   & Whether anyone can say that, because of the great number of linguistic
inputs into Britain, English is one of the most evolved languages in the
world, I do not know.  But it looks that way to me.

  DANGER: For reasons of not wanting to hurt any culture's national pride,
it is Politically Incorrect to say that any language can be BETTER than any
other language.  Publicly, we can say neither that English is more evolved,
nor better, in any way, than any other language.
 
  But, to return to the theme, Ron Clark was intent on forming a language
that melded the BEST characteristics found in the various national
languages; and it just so happened that he noticed the sentence structure
of English was better than that of other  languages.  An ancient text book
on 'Parsing and Analysis' would clarify the picture.

*   This is true.  However most people use English within well-established
syntactic guidelines; and we will quickly recognise it if someone's word
order is at fault.

*   Rigidity is definitely out: of both the 'thou must' and the 'thou must
not' variety.
    I might dispute this claim that Glosa is not natural - and so might
Ron, if he were still here.  While Glosa did not get formed "naturally",
the authors planned it to be in conformity with the functioning of the
human brain, and, thus, naturalistic!
    Ron's reason for not writing a Glosa Grammar was two-fold: firstly, he
did not wish to impose an intellectually-derived set of rule on Glosa
learners; and, secondly, he felt that such a guide was unnecessary, because
Glosa was designed to be in tune with the way people spoke 'naturally,'
anyway.

  People should use the amount of marker words that makes them feel
comfortable; and if they write telegrammatically, but no-one reads their
prose, then they should add more small function words.

Central Glosa says, "An amusing and happy coincidence is
that the Passive Past Participle GE- happens to coincide
delightfully with the German as in, for example, GE-brochen,
broken."

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 7 Apr 2002 21:21:08 -0700 (PDT)

I think I figured out what's wrong. Volu and Tenta (and
others) actually have two meanings. English happens to use
them in two ways, and Glosa has inherited that "feature".
Perhaps Romance languages do as well--I haven't checked.

Anyway, in an analytical language, I think it is important
to have different words for:

I want to go home
I want pickles

I will try to help you
I will try the grapes

If we know that ~volu~ means "want to" then we know to
expect a verb to follow. On the other hand, if ~volu~ means
just "want", then we would expect a noun. Same for tenta.

In Glo, I suspect I am going to split any ambiguous verbs
like these, to help make it easier to write clear
sentences.

I know there are several folks out there with more

VOLU can mean "to want/desire" (verb) or "a/the want/desire" (noun).
It would be shortened to VOL if used as an auxiliary verb often enough.
The main verb would normally appear in infinitive form; Romance langs
use infinitive suffixes -R or -RE, English uses prepositions TO and FOR.
(In Occidental it's like, "Yo vole auxiliar" or "Yo vole assister".
That way the end of the verb phrase is certainly clear enough ...)

There seems to be two different cases here.
Try replacing with an English synonym.

I desire to go home
I desire pickles
I will endeavour to help you

but

* I will endeavour the grapes

So "try" has two meanings and "want" only one.

Saluta,

Good point, although I'll have to think about it more to
see if I agree. 

After I sent my message, I realized that "I want grapes" is
actually ambiguous. Do I want to _have_ grapes, _eat_
grapes, _get_ grapes, _see_ grapes, or something else? It
seems that in English we are eliding a verb because it can
be inferred by context.

"Try" seems to fit the same pattern: trying a grape might
be trying to _eat_ it, or _look at_ it, or _wear_ it.

So, perhaps ~volu~, ~tenta~, and other words with a similar
pattern MUST be followed by a substantive that is acting as
a verb. It seems like an odd exception, though, and hard to
enforce. So I did some research, and found that...

This whole discussion seems related to the "Modals"
category in the Glosa Basic Reference. But I'm not sure if
it is exactly the same. 

And the real problem seems to be with English, where
certain words can be used as modals _or_ verbs. I think
Glosa wants each word to be just one or the other.
Otherwise, how can we know whether the following word is a
verb or a noun? The word itself isn't decorated. The only
other indication would be to _require_ an NP marker at that
point. But that means that the _absence_ of a marker is
itself critical, which seems risky.

As you can tell, this is currently a big stumbling block
for me.

Kevin

While I was working on the dictionary, I have had some questions about
some Glosa words.  Now I received answers from Wendy Ashby.  Perhaps 
you are interested.  Saluta ex Marcel.

   --- --- ---

(Marcel asked, 2002-03-12:)
MS: Qo es Glosa verba pro "culture"?  Posi "kultura"?
(Wendy Ashby answered, her letter from 2002-03-23:)
WA: culture = kultura
(Changes, I made in the dictionary.  Updated version from 2002-04-10, 
http://www.glosa.org/gid )
--> "kultura +  culture" item added.

MS: Qo es Glosa verba pro "compliment"?  Posi 1000-verba "lauda", alo
    "komplimenta"?
WA: compliment = lauda 1000, komplimenta 6000.
--> "lauda 1++  applaud; approval; approve; pay tribute to; praise" 
      added meaning "compliment {admiration}". 
    "komplimenta  compliment {admiration}; compliment {greetings}" item 
      added. 
    "saluta 1++  greet; greeting; salute; yours truly" added meaning 
      "compliment {greetings}". 

MS: Qo es Glosa frase pro "to be looking forward to ..."?
WA: looking forward to = mi uti: atende kon entusi

      looking ]" item added. 
    "zelo atende 1+  looking forward to [be ]; forward to [be looking ]" 
      item added. 

MS: Qo es Glosa frase pro "to feel like doing something"?
WA: feel like doing something = este de akti uno-ra.
--> "este de akti uno-ra 1+  feel like doing something; like doing 
      something [feel ]" item added.

WA: stremato = Greek twist, turn, wrench.
    twisted muscle can cause stress on the joint, I know!
    main concept is twist, turn, wrench.

There is an article about to(po) and lo(ko/ka) in
PGN No. 71, March 1995, p. 4:
"to(po)" is a place, which is only a point without dimension,
"lo(ka)" is an extended place, an area.
I hope, I have made it clear in the last dictionary update.

I think, that "to" means only a location and not a time.
"Point in time" would be "kron", a longer time "tem".

Subject: [glosalist] styles in Glosa
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Tue, 9 Apr 2002 06:35:22 EDT

Tried to assemble some sort of syntax from sentences in PGN.
Found it very difficult. It looks as though there are several different 
styles of people's Glosa that vary markedly.
Basically, X(extra) S V O O X seems set in some sort of rather gooey stone 
(not all used each time of course) but the phrases can be very fuzzy edged 
and decidedly vague. A good thing to have this variety perhaps .......
There is poetry (I prefer to call some of them "word pictures") with no 
syntax, Some are in "English Style" where the syntax is that of English and 
the English words exchanged for Glosa ones, I have used both of these styles. 
What we seem to lack is a mundane, perhaps dull, tight, clear and precise 
style that would have helped me to find my errant camera.
Shall try but just now, must collect my brushes and wander off to the local 
art club.

It is pretty simple in concept, just an alternation of verb and noun phrases.
Phrases are precised to whatever degree desired via tense/number/etc particles.
The problem lately is that several people insist they can elide as many
grammatical particles as they please, despite excessive ambiguity.

And what if those goals were not reached but are still attainable?

No, from my own direct experience and study I know that French and Spanish
are just as logical in sentence structure as English. Such linguistically
naive (and insulting) opinions will not be well-received in the world.

> After thinking about it I percieved an evolutionary mechanism at work

All langs evolve over time, as will Glosa after its inventors are gone.
(I assume that there will be another attempt to revive Lingua Franca.)
Inflecting langs tend to go analytic/isolating (Latin -> French -> English).
But the process continues beyond that; Egyptian went several times around
the typological loop (because it was long undisturbed by foreign influence).
For more-logical grammar, see Quichua and Turkish and Ido (agglutination).

Some languages are much easier to learn than others. Some are more expressive.
Some are prettier in sound. Some are more logical in structure. There are
more dimensions I forget at the moment, and all languages can and do vary,
though over time they tend to drift back toward the center of each "scale".
Overall, there is no detectable difference between the major world langs.
A well-designed artificial language can maximize some desired traits,
but it's impossible for untrained monoglot amateurs to accomplish.

> Publicly, we can say

I just say what I mean and mean what I say. Some big companies are in
big trouble here because they "kept two sets of books" (Americal idiom).

Better in some ways. I like the Glosa "analytical" ideal, but there are
some drawbacks. French and Spanish speakers (and about half of all others)
strongly prefer adjectives to follow nouns. Chinese (and half the rest)
are accustomed to the relative clause preceding the noun. Turkish and
Japanese (and etc) want the verb phrase to be last in the sentence.
Glosa cannot accomodate them, Esperanto can (with its free word order),
and English speakers already have English. I can write a computer program
to relex English into nice-sounding nicely-spelled short CVCV words,
but that doesn't make a great world auxiliary language.

Upon further reflection, I realize that if we ALWAYS mark
direct objects with u or plu, the whole problem goes away.
Simple. No exceptions to remember or fret about.

> stumbling block for me.

No more stumbling. Glo will require u/plu at the beginning
of any direct object NP, even if the NP starts with ~mi~,
~mo~, etc. Similarly, Glo will require nu/du/pa at the
beginning of every VP, even if the VP starts with ~es~,
~habe~, etc.

One simple hard rule is simpler than several guidelines
with various exceptions.

Of course, I will apply the same rule to my Glosa writing.
Obviously I am in no position to coerce anyone else to do
so.

Kevin

So then, I didn't convince you that ~mi u bibli~ 
is the *underlying* Glosa form, paralleling the 
already excepted ~mi plu bibli~!!

And conventional Glosa would certainly put
~ne~ in front of ~nu~, ~du~ and ~pa~ in VPs.

Punctuation:-
Punctation separates. We separate "tri" and "na" slightly because we expect S

separates the sentence definitely from what follows. In my sentence, I want 
the S V and O to flow smoothly and without interuption, "qi ....... 
intereste" is part of O being a post modifier of "Ronda", the conjunction 
"qi" joins the clauses however the ";" separates them! The "qi" and the ";" 
contradict each other!

so:-
Meno tri, na pa visita un urba Ronda(37n5u) qi es kali e fo stimula.

don't like it much ....
Meno tri, na pa visita un urba ko nima Ronda a 35 gradu  nord e 5 uest. U co

~urba Ronda~ and ~nima Ronda~ are both using the same
syntactic pattern. How about ~un urba ge-nima Ronda~?

~co~ would refer to the whole of the previous
sentence. Maybe you mean ~U ci urba~?

I agree however I have some doubts about "ge-", I don't quite know what they 
are - What I'm getting at is my being unable to understand easily some glosa 
writings and trying to find a style that leaves no doubts ........
thanks for the addresses - I shall try to catch up with things

*  There is conversational English, and there is a corresponding
'conversational Glosa.'  However, we have all met people who write as they
speak - using English - and we usually suffer from their prose until we get
the 'lilt' of their "voice" in it.  I believe there is good Glosa prose,
and that people can learn to write such .. ^on the trot.^  However, I do
believe that there is even greater scope for sloppiness in hastily,
ill-considered Glosa than there is in hastily and ill-considered English.

     "I want to help."  is the brief form of "I want to help you."

    Where the phrases end ( or merge ) is uncertain in English:-

       I want    to help you.      OR    I want to help    you.     

    It is easier to think of "to help" as part of the compound VP:
  'want to help'.  Then we have our classical  Subj-Verb-Object  structure
.. even though it might only be so, in appearance.  But it stops anyone
from reading the 'help' as a NOUN.
    So, is  ~Mi vo auxi tu.~  unambiguous - as well as being unelided?
 
    But pushing the "unelision" story even further, we could derive,
          ~Mi vo don auxi a tu.~     
    Perhaps the concept, HELP, tends towards 'nouniness.'
    Then,  ~Mi vo auxi tu te akti id.~  leaves us in no doubt that the
concept wears its 'verby' garb.

Saluta,

Robin

*  Sid, Mate,
   Don't get you 'plu frasa' in a twist.  We do what we can with what we've
got.
   And, as you have noticed, Wendy, the remaining original Glosa author,
"cleaned up" you letter prior to publishing it in PGN.
   Well, mate, we, at the "List" end of Glosa might be somewhat
'experimental' in our approach to auxilliary language, including Glosa, but
Wendy might not.

   The 'mass action effect' is the only hope for those of us who value the
presence of what I call the 'logical "that"' in a language.  I feel that
trying to 'kill' a word - especially one for which there is a felt need,
and one for which there is no suitable alternative - is an error.  On the
question of a %punctuational% alternative to using a word in place of the
English "that" in Glosa, I have found that a full colon, ":", satisfies me,
but the semi-colon, ";", does not.  Meanwhile, of course, we do have the
semicolon as an 'abbreviation' for ~; qi~, but that is a different "that."
 EG  His story was that he was sick.    ~An histori pa es ke an pa habe pato.~
    
      His story was: he was sick.       ~An histori pa es: an pa habe pato.~


      His hat, which is red, is enormous.  

      An kefa-ve; qi habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

      An kefa-ve; habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

   It does seem a bit against the grain to elevate all of your non-capitals
to capitals - especially in a written item, which has the non-use of
capitals as its theme.  HOWEVER, i MUST ADD THAT, IN MY OPINION, YOU WILL
FIND LESS MASS ACTION SUPPORTING YOU IN THIS 'MODERN' PUSH TOWARDS USING
ALL LOWER CASE.

   Concerning your impassioned plea:
      ""Nu-pa, mi pa grafo uno English e pa translati id a "Orthodox" 
Glosa ko plu mega litera e plu ";". Mi pa verifi; plu pan verba es in
u "Central Glosa" lexiko.
Nu, mi gene dice; plu ";" es falsi e pluso plu de verba ex "Central 
Glosa"! Mi no pote vikto!""
   I can make no comment without actual examples.  Please share these with
us on the List.

   On the question of translating English to Glosa, I try to avoid this as
much as possible.  I much rather call suitable Glosa words to mind, and
then ^roll them around^ together.  I call this "thinking in Glosa."
   I suggest that this method produces better Glosa prose, than trying to
convert English sentences into Glosa ones; because, otherwise, the English
metaphors and idioms casn often get transferred across the language barrier.

Hang In There, Sid,

Robin Gaskell

*  I understand your desire for 'flow', but I also see the need for 
clause(start) markers, as well.  For those whose prose is not as neat, or
well-thought-out as yours, the use of punctuational sign-posts is a
valuable, and free, indicator of sentence structure.

   On the question of sentence dynamics, I do believe that there is a case
for sometimes slowing down a sentence - through addition of punctuation -
and othertimes, maintaining the flow by avoiding punctuation marks that
might seem suitable, but which would, if present, break the flow of thought.
   So it is a question of  ~ ...; qi ... ~ and its dynamics.

     ~ ...; ... ~      definitely creates a stop.
     ~ ... qi ... ~    runs clauses together, when the casual reader might
not notice.
     ~ ...; qi ... ~   combines the stop with a strong flow .. producing a
pause, which, in my opinion, like Little Bear's porridge, is just right.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sun, 14 Apr 2002 13:21:40 EDT

I feel considerably more at ease with Glosa after looking at Robin's seminars 
so here is a lump of a sid seminar ......
He uses the NP "the 3 fast loud red cars", I shall add a little:- " Mu pa es 
plu tri celere fo-sono rubi vagona" and see how I get on with reading it.
 1) the VP. I need to know where it starts, where it ends and the head word. 
It starts with the intro-word "pa" and  after the subject NP which is a 
pronoun. It ends just before the object NP which starts with the intro-word 
"plu", its head is "es". easy!
2) The subject NP, because it is a pronoun, starts and ends with its 
head-word. also easy
3) The object NP starts with "plu" and ends with the full stop/period. The 
last word in the phrase is the head as words' importance grows as its 
position moes further on.
So I have "mu" + "pa es" + "plu ..... vagona".
All very easy and clear even for me.
The confusion starts with the pre modifiers "tri celere fo-sono rubi"
Both Robin and Marcel have given the impression the a pre modifier modifies 
the following word. "rubi (Mods) vagona" OK.
"fo-sono (Mods) rubi" I suppose bright red could be described as loud ......
"celere (Mods) fo-sono" a quick sound ??
"tri (Mods) celere)" ?????
A "very long haired man" could be OK
very long + long hairs + hairy man
Sorry Robin, I think you need "plu tri e celere e fo-sono e rubi vagona" 
tri, celere, fo-sono e rubi all have equal status and all modify "vagona"
"a tall and very long haired man" ........
"u alti e fo longi triki andro"
It might be a matter of style whether you use "e" repeatedly or use the 
English comma "a, b, c, and d" but spaces will signal a chain of modifiers 
modifying each other.

sid, I have to agree that what you are saying 
is perfectly correct, according to the description
of Glosa grammar given in the seminars. And,
in fact ~plu~ is also modifying ~vagona~, so it
would be 

~ plu e tri e celere e fo-sono e rubi vagona~
     or
~plu, tri, celere, fo-sono e rubi vagona~

(But for me, the ~plu~ is redundant given
the ~tri~.)

And I wonder if the PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
rules are not an over-simplification.

In English, we only co-ordinate the adjectives, 
when they belong to the same semantic class.

For example- three or four red cars, 
three red and blue wooden cars,
three red chrome and glass cars.

I overlooked the "tri" and "plu" in the heat of the chase. My view is that 
"u", "plu" and a number can introduce a NP so both are not needed together.
What I have been trying to point out at times is that G seems to be aimed at 
Eoropeans especially English. The rules should be basically as simple and 
regular as possible to encourage newcomers and beginners. From there a writer 
can bend the rules depending on whom s/he is talking to.
For instance, I suggested dropping the capitals because some languages, ie 
Hindi, do not use them. If anyone likes them they could use them but 
remembering that they might confuse  other people and even discourage them to 
continue.
I would have dropped English like a hot brick before getting far with it's 
spelling, I haven't continued with French because of it's irrational (to me) 
genders. In spite of the genders, I enjoyed Hindi because it seemed so 
regular. Glosa has probably lost quite a few followers because it still seems 
to hang on to odds and ends  like capitals, x=ks, q=kw and so on. G appears 
to be heading in the right direction but .......

maths   a+(b+c)*d /(a+b) *(c+d) the correct placing of the signs is essential 
as I know from my freqent misplacing of them.

the very good, almost (blue, light) roses .....very involved and rathr 
confused

but
p=b+c
q=p*d
r=q+a
s=a+b
t=c+d
u+s*t
x=r/u

the roses are very good, they are almost blue and almost light.
not confused. just utter rubbish!
lesson put your complex modifiers in shorter sentences or clauses.
post modifiers
the very good roses with almost blue colour and almost light tone.
post mods need preposition
or
the v g roses, almost blue and almost light
the break in the clause's flow (,) indicates that roses is the head of the 
phrase
sorry, I'm a bit blurred today!

This seems a good plan to me, but I would suggest
a semicolon; in line with the authors preference; 
and view almost blue as elided from 
which are almost blue.

Robins seminars also seem to me to push 
the head final idea too far, as there are a number
of occasions when the head is
qualified/post-modified.

For example -
Days and months: ~di bi~, ~meno tri~, etc
Other ordinals: ~u bibli penta~ [the 5th book]
Postpostions : ~u bileta ab~ [a single ticket],
                ~u bileta versi~ [a return ticket]
Prepositional phrases: 
              ~u-la mega domi proxi religio-do~ 
                 [that big house near the church]
Adjectival Clauses: ~Un andro; tu pa vide pa
setimana;~
                    ~U gina; qi ki peri gono;~
Past participles: ~u bibli ge-grafo ex G B Shaw~ 
                    [a book written by GBS]
Present participles:
        ~plu verba semani lauda alo no-lauda~
       [vocables denoting approval or disapproval]

we normally need to know where the next phrase starts before we can tell 
which is the head of the current phrase. If we use post modifiers, it might 
be as well if they started with a preposition so that we know we are still in 
a phrase. Post modifiers then, would allow us to spread the modifiers about 
so that they don't get jumbled up .The tall,thin, long haired white man  was

Perhaps then, for clarity, only numbers, 
prepostions/postpostions and semicolons 
should be allowed after the head word 
in a noun phrase.

~bi anua retro~ [two years ago])

Relative clauses are a difficult problem for the language designer to
solve. It requires a lot of study of actual world languages to do right.
I've already recommended that everyone study Rick Morneau's site,
especially his essay on "Syntax"; Glosa relies almost entirely on syntax,
and the current semicolonic mishmash is probably the single most glaring
error in its grammar, yet is so easy to fix ...

[re-formatted examples follow:]

> His story was that he was sick.
> An histori pa es ke an pa habe pato.

How about using the officially blessed CO and QOD or even just DE?

"An pa dice de an pato." -- "He spoke of his (own) sickness."
"An pa dice de an anas es pato." -- "He talked about his duck being sick."
"An es pato, (u-)co an pa dice." -- "He (is/was) sick, that's what he said."

> His hat, which is red, is enormous.
> An kefa-ve; qi habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

"An kefa tegu qod pa es melano nu es polio." -- whatever.

QOD is ok, but KE is not? GMAFB.

This happened to trigger a concern about Glosa that I've been pondering 
recently:

I'm beginning to doubt whether posessives should (or can) be treated as simple 
adjectives. In this particular case, how do I know whether we are talking about 
"his hat" or a "masculine hat"? If we have "an feli" is that "his cat" or a 
"male cat", and why?

I, too, mistrust "possessives" in Glosa. Possessives along with
numbers and other "determiners" are different from attributive
adjectives in several important ways. At least English can
distinguish "her cat" from "she-cat" ... Anyway, I recommend
once again the creation of a neat paradigm showing where each
particle fits. There should be one for verbal, another for
nominal phrases. A consistent set of terms would be needed
for the classes of words, such as: articles, pronouns, nouns,
determiners, attributives, participles, etc.

But if somebody wants a true Saxon/Chinese genitive,
then I suggest the particle "SU" as a sort of anti-"DE".
Then you'd have like "John SU cat = cat DE John", with
no more confusion about she-cats: "FE cat != fe SU cat".
It's very useful; Chinese have one particle for genitives
that also serves as their only relativizer ("KE").
Drives the French-speakers crazy, though.

Tell me more. I don't like "feli de an" because it is FAR too vague, and DE 
already has too many meanings. How would SU fit into a complex NP?

an su mega, ami feli pa vora.
u paleo, alti, kali an su mega, ami feli pa salta epi u tabla.

?

It _feels_ almost like a verb to me. It's as if it meant "owns", except that it 
actually leaves the focus (subject?) on the word(s) before it, whereas "owns" 
would not do that. I guess my English mind could get used to thinking of it as 
"'s", like John's cat. Hmmm.

If I were looking for a new word to replace DE in a genitive role, do you have 
any suggestions?

    People were getting their wires crossed with all sorts of
"inflections," and it became necessary to distinguish the particular
inflections that had been invented, or had evolved, to specify a word's
function as a particular part of speech.

*   Frankly, I go with the 'natural' order, whereby frequently used
"function-words" are shorter, and the words symbolising concepts are
longer.  So, Glosa particles and a number of function words (conjunctions,
prepositions, verb auxilliaries, negatives, pronouns) are short, and
usually below Charles' suggested cut-off, of three letters.  But some
verboids and very common verbs are also short, for obvios reasons: we don't
want to stumble over unnecessarily long less-important words while getting
to the nub of the story's concepts. (es, ki, vo)  
    My feeling is that a rigid number coding of language is in the realms
of, "Ve haf vays of making you talk."

have always thought a URL's use of the 'double slash' (//) was very
attractive, and distinctive.  You might try:
     'The cat // sat // on the mat.'
 
    However in sentences with multiple VPs we might find it necessary to
denote both the starts and the endings of such VPs.
    This could be shown:
     Blah blah blah / VP \ blah blah blah blah / VP \ blah blah  etc.
OR
     Blah blah blah < VP > blah blah blah blah < VP > blah blah  etc.

   For most sentences the double-slash should suffice. EG

 First we must decide where the poor performance of Glosa, as a language,
stems from: how much is in the design of Glosa's grammar, and how much is
in poorly thought-out sentences? 
   The sloppiness of the majority of English is quite acceptable - to its
native speakers - because people get used to its funny little ways.
However, English CAN be used unequivocally, and well.
   I suspect that there is a parallel between English and Glosa, here, but
Glosa-users lack the years of childhood ear-training, and Glosa is supposed
to be used at the internationally unequivocal level all the time.
   On top of that, people learning the language assume that the level of
sloppiness acceptable in English should also be available in Glosa.  It is
not.  I might add, that, as in most things, where people are expected to
think before acting, in speaking good Glosa people are expected to consider
the knowlege of their listeners or readers and to qualify their sentences
accordingly.  
   Ron Clark was always using the word, "context," and suggesting that the
speaker's intent would be bourne along by the surrounding situation.
Perhaps he overdid it a bit.
   However, linguists quoting context-free snippets of information are
always going to run into semantic trouble.  And frankly, this could be a
large waste of time: our mate Zamenhoff awarded Esperanto writers a title
for completing an original written work in that language; perhaps he was
trying to encourage his learning community to apply the new language to a
real-world situation, and to do so consistently for a number of pages.
Let's see,
    Robin Gaskell, Grafo-pe
    Is that sufficient reward for writing a few children's stories in
Glosa?   It could be shortened to 'R. Gaskell, G-p.'

   One of the original 'selling points' of Glosa was that, like Italian,
which has terminal vowels facilitating flow, Glosa would also _sound nice_
because it, too, would have vowel terminals.

*  One way of working at this level of language design is to try the
various words out in a number of situations: this is best done through
incorporating ideas of time into written works; and as a result of
variously rolling the alternatives around in your head, and in your mouth,
one seems to feel better, and/or sound better, than the other.  When the
finished sentence is read aloud one usage feels better than the other.  
   The feel of the words in the mouth (probably where language started)
also plays a part in the decision.  Sorry about the "noble savage", but in
my book,  when it comes to language formation, he wins over the clinically
precise mathematician - any day.

*   We do need words to convey the various concepts of time, and a range

   nu

   kron
   tem

 I suspect that there is something going on, psychologically, about 'time',
and that concepts of movement, seqencing, discrete points of time, broader
durations, and approximations all come into it.  The academic linguist
wants a clear-cut concept to fit the words of his lexicon, BUT ... concepts
are seldom clear-cut.  Sometimes we have to let our innate nature speak
directly - without first pasteurising the words by passing them through our
consciousness. 
   For me, ~kron~ always seems to have a question mark attached to it,
in line with,  
    "I did it when I was ready."
    "When?"
whereas ~tem~ seems a softer, unchallenging measure of time.
   I know that this might sound like psychological clap trap, but the
challenge is laid: "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Sleeping Beauty and the Seven
Dwarves", "Rumplestiltskin" and quite a few more are still awaiting
rendition in Glosa.  See how you think about the 'feel' of words after
retelling a children's story in Glosa.

About DE, it is supposed to be the vaguest preposition; replace with
a more specific "ex" or "ad" or "in" etc as in French, or if one
likes participles (DU and GE?) one could be very precise as in ...
"u-la feli ge/du proprie de/ex/ad John".

Yes, that's the Saxon genitive exactly. Chinese take it a step
further, using it for relative clauses as well.

> any suggestions?

Glosa needs to keep its syntax as simple as possible, so adding
a 2nd genitive can't be a serious possibility especially since
Spanish/French would absolutely hate it and I can't imagine any IAL
succeeding without their support. But it does help to learn how some
other languages such as Chinese/Turkish/Quechua handle genitives,
and basically they do it backwards from Glosa's DE particle.
Glosa is unsophisticated. Its authors knew nothing of linguistics
or history of IALs. Unconsciously they were resusitating Lingua Franca
(good idea!) except for using English adjective-noun order.

I think we're stuck with the DE genitive (and KE relativizer,
despite what Wendy said) but we can safely ignore/abandon the
possessive pronouns, which cause lots of trouble for no benefit.
Sometimes I just can't resist that illegal SU trick, though.

I'm just a civilian. Wendy is the Grand Datuval of Glosa.
(The term dates from Shleyer's Volapuk debacle.)

Because it is not in our power to revise Glosa. Anyway, what I said
seems simple enough: one particle cannot serve as both verb phrase
*and* participle marker -- these are mutually exclusive uses.

> our mate Zamenhoff awarded Esperanto writers a title

He imitated Schleyer in that. In contrast, others have turned over
control of their languages to committees, encouraging the further
reform and "amelioration" and evolution thereof.

I don't seriously advocate POS final vowels anymore; 5 isn't enough.
So the particles must energize the grammar and determine whether
words are nouns or act verby, etc.

Good idea, badly implemented. Fixable.

Subject: [glosalist] Glo(sa) Sentence Structure
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2002 20:58:13 -0700

My Russian Glosa-ami Andrey asked if I had tried creating a BNF model for Glosa 
sentences. I hadn't, but it sounded interesting enough to try. Below, you will 
find my first attempt. I've probably misused and abused some linguistic terms, 
and would appreciate feedback in that area. I've probably also mangled the BNF 
syntax quite a bit, but it seems usable to me.

Note that it is actually a Glo model, but should apply to my own Glosa writing 
with just a couple changes. First, Glosa does not have ~he~ for imperatives, 
~ca~ as a non-tense verb phrase start marker, and ~sa~ as a genitive 
preposition. Second, Glo has slightly different pronouns and "titles", and uses 
~zero~ instead of ~ne~. Third, Glo omits dashes in some places, such as 
~anti-co~ and ~qo-mode~. Those are the only differences I can think of between 
this model and one specifically for (my accent of) Glosa.

I got a few things out of this. First, it is more complex than I would like, but 
I'm not sure it can really become simpler. Second, I think Glo helps in some 
areas by making the rules tighter (e.g. requiring a tense marker or ~ca~), but 
helps in other ways by having the rules be looser (e.g. allowing VerbModifiers 
in any order).

Enjoy!

Kevin says:

> My Russian Glosa-ami Andrey asked if I had tried creating a BNF model for Glosa

I've raised that issue here before and pointed out Rick Morneau's essay "Syntax"
which walks through the construction of a BNF subset of English -- and I agree
that, especially for a syntax-heavy grammar like Glosa's, this is needed.

> I've probably misused and abused some linguistic terms,

Every natural language stretches or breaks those definitions. I wanted to
mention anyway: http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/language/Grammar.htm

Also, on ALT.LANGUAGE.ARTIFICIAL it looks like Ch. Thompson is building
an analytic Glosa-esque language, using some ideas I found interesting.

The main thing about BNF is that it is the first step before generating
a parser. And you can run it in reverse to generate test sentences.
Why remain in the 19th century with Zamenhoff? We can do better now.

Thinking in panic

Think in Glosa:-
main clause= X=greeting, S=pronoun, V=intro head, O=sub clause
sub clause=intro, S=intro mod head, V=intro mod head, no O
X=saluta, sinior,  S=mi   V=puta (no intro needed after pronoun - we know 
where S ends and V begins) 
sub clause intro=ke (in my style) (from begin to here is to be polite - the 
info starts now) S intro = u, mod = mi head=fotografi-me V intro=pa mod=gene 
(passive, the done-to becomes S) lose.

Saluta Sinior, mi puta ke u mi fotografi-me pa gene lose.

The chemist realises that "camera" is the key to my visit. If he had the 
camera, he would show it, if not he would be puzzled - mission accomplished!
The shop points to her stock of cameras and is also puzzled by my response.
The cafe also is puzzled.
The camera is lost!

NEgative, if required,

Standard Glosa numbers, as I understand them, would be
   21 987,5 = ~bi mo nona ok seti koma pen~
   22 000 = ~bi bi ze ze ze~ or ~bi bi kilo~ 
That is with ~kilo~ only as the last word in the

Is that correct?

www.glosa.org now has got a French section, too.


  http://www.glosa.org/brevi/francais.htm

provides the Glosa introduction from the book "Francais-Glosa 1000".
Of course - in the tradition of GEO publishing - it was cruel material
again.  Many thanks to the help of Frans Medaer, Belgium, who
reported 100 (!) (French) mistakes to me, which are now corrected.


>From the same book, there is also a sample text available:

  http://www.glosa.org/brevi/frdaudet.htm .

The funny story about alcoholism is one of the longest Glosa texts at
all.

Syd ponders:

> NPs and VPs have intro particles, What about Adjective phrases?

Adjectives are just components of noun phrases. Many languages
do not even have "adjectives" as a full-fledged part-of-speech.
But what you're probably concerned with are prepositional and
participial phrases modifying nouns. And possibly things like
"a country rich in oil" as described by Rick Morneau. They're
just specialized noun and verb phrases introduced by appropriate
particles (auxiliaries/modals, articles/prepositions). Anything
that uses pre-positioned particles can be handled by simple
Glosa syntax, but participles are currently ill-defined, AFAIK.

My incomplete theory of Glosa grammar is something like this:
There are 2 major classes of words, the regular semantic ones
versus the 100 or so grammatical particles. Any regular word
can be coerced into acting like what are commonly called verbs,
nouns, adjectives, and some adverbs; this is achieved by
pre-posing a grammatical particle of some sort, and sorting
the head word down to the end of phrase. The result is that
one can summarize G grammar by concocting a few paradigms,
chiefly those for the verbal and nominal phrases.

        tener (Lat.)   =   "soft, delicate, tender".

*   Hi Kevin and all,
    Well, there's quite a nest of "holding" words throughout the Latin
dictionary:-
   sus-  indicates "upwards" and is related no doubt to the French `sur`
[on], which seems to come directly from Latin, too.  ~sur~ is Old Glosa for
what is now rendered ~epi~ [on].
   sustineo   = "to hold up, keep up, support, sustain"
   "sustain"  -  sustineo; sustento
   "hold"     -  teneo
   tendo, tentum  =   to stretch, stretch out, make tense,
                       distend, extend  
   sustento   =  "hold up, keep upright sustain; to maitain, 
                       preserve, sustain with food           
 
    So, yes, there is a case for another word, or two, around this area, to
cover the various was of 'holding' and 'sustaining'.
    The brief ~susta~ is adequate for Glo, whilst I might prefer, for
Glosa, something a little longer, indication the derivation, such as -
   ~sustene~
             Also, here, again, I might put in a plug for my theory that
the brain needs time to process the sounds it inputs, and so, the
three-vowel word wins over the apparently more efficient (on a
meaning/letter basis) two-vowel, ~susta.~
    As well, ~sustene~ looks like a different word from ~tena~, whereas
~sustena~ might look like a compound.
    Further, the concept, "to sustain" does include a longer 'time' factor
than that of 'to hold', and often, in the second word,it is only implied.
So there is a case for a Glosa addition - as well as a Glo one.
    I have not researched Roget's Thesaurus in this area, but there could
even be another couple of concepts, not currently covered by Glosa words,
wanting renditions into Glosa.

*   Wendy's comment, in a letter to me, was that Basic English, of approx
850, words proved awkward, and inadequate for higher-level discussion.  She
doubted the viability of Glo.
    In my understanding, as long as there are not too many different forms,
learning Glo, and then moving to Glosa, could possibly be likened to
learning to read and write using the Initial Teaching Alphabet (ITA), and
then, moving on, to using the standard alphabet.

Saluta,

Robin
  P.S. There probably is no other location for Glo; starting up a Mailing
List can be a very slow process - especially when your topic is rather
arcane, as auxiliary languages tend to be.   R.

        qi ge-uti in plu Palaeo Lingua.
      [which used in N(pl) old language]
     , which used in the Old Languages. 

    If ~ge-uti~ means "gets used", then it's OK, but would this usage imply
that the ~ge-~ is used double: giving BOTH the "gets" and the "-ed"?
    I would also feel that the vocal inflection associated with the ~alo
ma~ should be shadowed, in text, by the use of commas.
    And semantically, I am having a little trouble with separating the
numbers for Glosa and for Old Language usage.
 
    So I might turn it around, thus:-
   vice tri alo ma verba, qi ge-uti in plu Palaeo Lingua.
BECOMES
 vice plu tri, alo ma, verba; ge-nece pro un uti de plu Palaeo Lingua.
                              needed for the use of the Old Langs.

*   Good idea, but Glo's vocab is likely to grow far beyond th 500-word
limit, as other concepts are added, similarly.

    Your use of ~plus~ as a Verb is quite correct - according to Glosa
rules - but still feels funny.  Am I an old fuddy, Anglophile, or do other
also feel that ~inklude ... in~ or ~adi ... a~ would be more apt?
    IE "include ... in" or "add ... to" rather than "also ... to".
     
    The sentence goes on without stopping: though it is understandable, it
might have a semicolon to introduce the new clause; plus a ~plu~ to neaten
off the plurality; and, for good measure, a word-change from ~idea.~ 
IE
  idea a mi lista de plu koncepa; qi Glo fu nece klu.
 [idea to my list of N(pl) concept, that Glo will need to include] 
  idea to my list of concepts, that Glo will need to include.

*  First to consider this clause:-
     pan na fu   ma   boni   na  Glosa logi
    [all us will more good our Glosa understand]
     all of us will better understand our Glosa

   I suggest that the object of this clause has been placed incorrectly
within the VP.  Re-ordering the clause to ensure proper S-V-O structure it
might look like this:-
     pan na fu ma boni logi na Glosa 
 OR
     pan na // fu ma boni logi // na Glosa  (marking heavily the VP)
           /                    \
           will better understand
     tense part.         'verb'
              comparative  

   Then here is a sentiment which is clear to all:-
      e posi     na fu   akorda de    plu Glosa lega
     [& possibly we will agree  about the Glosa laws]
    and possibly we will agree about the Glosa rules

   Were this my own writing, and I was editing it, I would tease it out a
bit, nouning ~akorda~, and softening ~lega~ to ~regula ~ :-
  e posi, na fu gene akorda koncerne plu regula de Glosa gramatika 
Structure:
   conj. |    prime clause  |    phrase         |     phrase      |

               get agreement
               become agreed
             reach agreement

    So,by portioning out the separate ideas into supplementary phrases, we
can avoid the pressure of pushing too many ideas into a limited space.
Using a non-Linguistic term, I would call it "shoe-horning."
    Also I take the opportunity here to demonstrate the way Glosa words do
not necessarily translate, hard and fast, the exact meanings of English
words: rightly or wrongly, I intuit that Glosa works closer to the deep
structure of language than does English.
While English has mellowed greatly, and is fairly close, in its
psychological structures, to the subconscious language of thought, this has
come about through people (especially children) taking the words and the
grammatical structures, and 'bending' them into more psychologically
comfortable shapes.  Were I to coin a phrase, I might describe English as
"the eternal creole."
    Ron Clark did recognise this creolisation process, and its trend
towards a language that was intuitive and concept based; he tried, with
Glosa, to push the structure of language towards the conclusion of this
intuitional process.  Experience on Glosalist makes me wonder if the human
race is ready, yet, for this stage of language development.

  Ci es u responde ex mi e-posta ad u 'Socialist 
 [here is the response from my e-mail to the 'Socialist]

  In English, the 'phrasal verb' "to respond to" has seeped into our bones.
 Were we to choose another Glosa word to form a 'Glosa phrasal verb' what
would it be: pro, a, de?
  In my sentence, the ~ex~ is NOT attached to ~responde~, as "to" is to
"respond" in English.

  Again, I have teased the ideas out using associated phrases following a
prime clause:-

  |   Clause       |   Phrase    |   Phrase
  Ci es u responde ex mi e-posta ad u 'Socialist

*   And here's a meaning for ~ex~, not in _Glosa 6000_: "by".

    On the question of EX vs PRO, it seems clear to me that EX is
'backward-looking' and always refers to something that has 'past'
associations; PRO, on the other hand seems 'progressive' and
'forward-looking'.  Perhaps this reference is to the little-know linguistic
quality, "flavour."

  I get the impression that you have said to yourself, "Aha, that
translates a particular English word, or phrase, thus I can use it in
Glosa, anytime I want to translate that particular bit of English."
           SE  - maybe a separate word in Glo, but was incorporated into
Glosa to give 'the reflexive,' and to be attached to the 'verb' it
reflexes.    EG   U bomba pa explode-se.
                  [the bomb did explode - to itself]
                     The bomb exploded itself.

            CO  - likewise in Glosa this does not occur as a separate
particle ( -CO = the just said).  Where it comes from, I do not know, but
it was added to Glosa not long before the 1992 dictionary was printed (p57
_Glosa 6000_), and was intended to be always part of a compound, EG ko-co,
anti-co.

            ;  - generally suggested for use as a signpost to mark the
start of a phrase, but the special use was in preceding the ~qi~ of an Ad

*   This seems very well observed by Nick.  The 'semantics' do seem to play
a big part in the use of a language with "Syntax-based Grammar."
    Here ~tende~ plays the part of a VERBOID, but ~volu~ does not seem to
bend so easily to the Verboid function.
    While some of us wish to use this concept as a Verboid, we might, while
it is still in the GID, use the abbreviated form ~vo~ for this purpose.
   EG   Ka mi vo auxi an, mi pa ki ad an domi. 
   Because I wished to help him, I went to his house.

    I imagine ~vo~ might be  =  wish, would( will-do).

Yes, I was saying that it is ~qo-lo~ for "where" question and ~qi-lo~ for
"where" conjuction.

I agree with the view of Glosa as a euro-creole. So did the speakers
of the Lingua Franca for over 800 years. And according to Bickerton,
creoles are closer to the human "proto-language". The compiler of
Occidental also believed that Europeans generally are evolving their
languages toward analytic syntax.

> SE  - maybe a separate word in Glo, but was incorporated into
> Glosa to give 'the reflexive,'

SE is a reflexive particle in many euro-langs, except, it has really
become more of a passive than a reflexive, which is very confusing.
I think that in Glosa the passive is maybe GE or ES rather than SE.

>> I have tentatively added my first non-Glosa word to Glo:

We're back to those Roman "super-productive" morphemes again ...
SUB + STARE = English "to sustain" = (poetic) "hold up from below".
I once counted something like 20 productive prefixes that combine
with 200 or so stems to produce thousands of latinate words from
amazingly few elements. That's a good derivational system.

> The brief ~susta~ is adequate for Glo, whilst I might prefer, for

TEN- forms a different word-family in Latin. But I agree that
the usual CVCV pattern is inadequate for super-productives.
In fact, experimentation shows that CVCVC (3 separate consonant
clusters) are needed to disambiguate most of the euro-vocab.
However STA is exceptional and I find SUSTA not bad actually ...

I kinda agree with that theory (so maybe you should reconsider it).
Longer content words and shorter particles, for smoother digestion.

> As well, ~sustene~ looks like a different word from ~tena~, whereas
> ~sustena~ might look like a compound.

Follow the Latin spellings rather than false phoneticity and then
suSTA beats susTEN. Better to go completely apriori than to disguise
the well-known roots of our shared Greco-Latin culture. I mean,
adoption of euro-vocab is good but mangling it is counter-mnemonic.

*   The question of optionality comes in here: is the N(sing/pl) marker a
space-filler that is called upon to indicate the NP's start in the absence
of any meaningful NP indicator (assuming that disambiguation is necessary),
or is the N(sing/pl) always assumed to be there and ready to pop through,
no matter how redundant it might be?
    My guess is that this moves over to the realms of the computer handling
of language.  If we are going to raise Glosa to the level of a 'Query
Language' then this "grammar" will be somewhat different from the
Humanly-usable, Glosa Grammar; and, the former will carry the coded
instruction that the suitable NOUN(Singular/Plural) particle must be
inserted at the start of any Noun Phrase, when no alternative NP Indicator
is present.

Saluta,

In my mind, qo can *only* be used for a question, and never for a conjunction in 
a non-question sentence.

18 Steps only uses qo in one sentence that does not end with a question mark, 
and I would argue that a question mark should have been present.

Or "all of us will better our Glosa understanding"
ie "all of us will improve our understanding of Glosa".

~an vive~  =  ~u vive de an~ [the life of him]
~an~ can start a noun phrase as well as be 
a pronoun and be followed by a verb. 

~u an vive~ would mean "the male life".

> puzzled by detekte-se  why not merely detekte?  

 I was aiming to convey the idea "find for herself" 
(implying meet and form a new partner 
relationship with) instead of just noticing 
another man exists.

Or "a/the man's life", which is certainly close to "his life".

This is why Glo now has SA to indicate posession. Also, currently, Glo splits 
he/him (AN) from man/male/masculine (ANDRO). So, in Glo:
~an sa vive~ = his life
~u andro sa vive~ = a/the man's life
~u andro vive~ = a/the masculine life

SA has been a surprisingly pleasant and powerful addition to Glo, and I have 
very quickly embraced it both as a writer and as a reader. I heartily recommend 
that Glosa adopt something similar.

Kevin

A "male life" could be "an-vive" (like "fe-bovi" ...).
I am still not convinced and would agree with Syd:
With the order

  <noun phrase marker u(n)/plu> +
  <attributes, also possessive pronouns> +
  ...
  <main concept word, noun>

the noun phrase could be easier acknowledged.

Another argument: appositions.

Wrong (but IMO better) Glosa:
  "Mi ne amo plu vi simi."  - I do not like your apes.
Classical Glosa:
  "Mi ne amo vi plu simi."  - I do not like your apes.
Apposition:
  "Mi ne amo vi, plu simi." - I do not like you apes.

No. In Glosa ~andro~ means "man", and ~an~ means "he"
and includes animal maleness. So "a/the man's life"
would be ~u andro vive~.

Compare ~vi tri simi~ [your three apes] and
~tri vi simi~ [the ape belonging to you three people].

According to GID:
an 1++G          he; him; his; male; masculine
andro 1++G       gentleman; husband; man

So you're saying that ~an~ means male (adj) but not male (n)?  How would I know 
this? Are you saying that ~andro~ cannot mean male (adj), masculine (adj)?

"man" = "male human" or ~un andro~ = ~un an homi~

But there are male animals, which are also "males".

So "male" does not equal "man". 

My Granny's budgie is a male, but not a man!

I would think without a clue from context that     
~un andro equs~ was a half-man-half-horse creature 
out of mythology, or possibly, "the man's horse".

Yes, it's an interesting preposition. I believe
Russian has one like it, to mark the thing owned.

Is is possible in Glo to invert the sentence
~U bibli es de mi~ [The book belongs to me] and
get ~Mi es sa u bibli~ [I am the owner of the book]?

SA (~sa~) is a Glo (not Glosa) word. In Glo (not Glosa):

~u parenta zoa~ = a parent animal (animal that is a parent)
~u parenta sa zoa~ = a parent's animal

The first sentence is ambiguous in Glosa.

18 Steps and the Glosa Basic Reference list ~Sinior~ for mister (abbreviated 
~Sr.~), and they list ~Siniora~ and ~Siniorina~ for miss/mrs/ms, all abbreviated 
as ~Sa.~ The GID shifts these to ~senior~ and ~seniora~

Of course, distinguishing the marital status and perhaps youthfulness of women 
but not men is a pointless, sexist cultural artifact, and should not be carried 
into Glosa.

There is a suggestion in 18 steps (presumably added by Marcel?) that proposes 
~Civi~, ~An-civi~, and ~Fe-civi~ as better honorific terms.

Glo (not Glosa) currently has ~an~ for mr. and ~fe~ for miss/ms/mrs. For 
example: ~mi pa dona plu sito ad fe Brown.~ I'm not sure if Glo will keep these 
or shift to something else. As a member of a "younger generation" and a resident 
of a very casual culture, I'm not big on honorifics.

As for "steep", I assume you mean "sharply inclined", and not "allowing tea to 
strengthen". The GID has ~fo-klina~ as a core word for steep.

Here's the (current) entry point for Glo:

http://qualitycode.com/html/glo-intro.eng.html

It's still very much a moving target. I would guess that the vocabulary is 90% 
locked down, and the rules are probably 80% solid. But it's still young enough 
that anything can change. For example, I recently removed ~uno~ (because it is 
redundant with ~u~), and renamed ~ze~ back to ~zero~ (to be more like Glosa and 
to have as few one-syllable non-particles as possible).

Chris Byrd is well known to former AUXLANG subscribers.
Anyone can check those archives for his famous exploit,
where he accidentally emailed to that list the details
of his plot to lie and suppress embarassing information
about his favorite IAL. A back-stabbing contest would
therefore be more appropriate.

Subject: [glosalist] adverbs
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 05 May 2002 06:30:43 -0700

While playing around with the BNF model for Glo, I realized that adverbs in 
Glosa seem to be all over the place. I would like to restrict them to a single 
location in Glo. My definition of "adverb" here is: any word or phrase that 
modifies the verb.

Here's what I see in Glosa right now:

~mi pa tako gresi.~
~mi pa mite u nota ad tu.~ (~ad tu~ is the adverb)
~pre nu, mi pa gresi.~ (~pre nu~ is the adverb)
~qo mode, mi pa gresi?~ (~qo mode~ is like an adverb)

It seems that every possible structure of English has been allowed into Glosa, 
which makes things much more complex than they need to be.

Following the rule that modifiers precede head words, we would have something 
like:

~mi pa tako gresi.~
~mi pa, ad tu, gresi.~
~mi pa pre-nu gresi.~
~mi pa qo mode gresi?~

Perhaps it's reasonable to say that if the "adverb" begins with a preposition, 
it can follow the verb, since we already have that rule for nouns. But does it 
go before or after the object?

~mi pa mite u nota ad tu~
~mi pa mite ad tu u nota~

The first is more comfortable for me, but I'm not sure it is any more logical or 
clear. Why not: ~mi pa ad tu mite u nota~, or even ~ad tu, mi pa mite u nota.~

I'm sure some of you feel that this flexibility is crucial to the success of 
Glosa, because without it authors will feel too constrained. Even if that were 
true (and I disagree), I believe that there should be just one "recommended" or 
"standard" form.

I'm going to go off and read Rick Morneau's pages, but I thought I would toss 
this question out to the list to see what people think.

There are at least 4 types of "adverbs" as far as I know:
you left out sentence modifiers (like "hopefully, ...")
and adjective modifiers (like "VERY wet"). Your definition
would include adverbial phrases (like "in a pig's eye")
and regular verb modifiers (like "he NEVER saw it").

> It seems that every possible structure of English has been allowed into Glosa,

English has complex syntax, completely unsuitable for an IAL.

Any phrase can be topicalized by placing it first in the sentence.
The direct object usually has the closest tie to the verb and so
should immediately follow it; I think it should take a special
preposition (perhaps "em"?) whenever it strays from normal position,
just as the agentive subject does (using "per" or "ex" or "ab").

> I'm sure some of you feel that this flexibility is crucial

Flexibility competes with simplicity. All languages are compromises ...
except Lisp.

in a SVO sentence, an adjective should be close to the N it modifies or there 
would be confusion. An adverb can be more or less anywhere as there is only 
one V in the clause. I rather like the idea that, as V, S and O have intro 
particles, so could adjective and adverb phrases, further I should like to be 
able to use particles that define S and O(like "em")
Prepositions to some extent can do that .......

Saluta!
I had too many porblems and events in my life, so I approx. didn't use
internet and was not active in Glosa. Adverbs is my favourite theme, so it's
good for begin.
I have to make a trip from Moscow for 2 or 3 days, and after that, I hope,
I'll send all the letter that wait to be posted to Charles, Marcel and
others!

This seems to mean
I was walking in the manner of yesterday.
There there is an "adverb2", wich definition maybe "the word or group of
words that modiefs the whole phrase".
I suppose: pre-nu, mi pa gresi.
If you will have combined both verbal adverbs, this will be great for Glosa,
not only for Glo.

Perhaps, is would be better to dispite the "indirect object" from the
adverb. But it's interesting how similliar they are in this case! However,
for Glosa it will be better to save the Hogben's view on the IO.
And of course I agree that we MUST systemize the using of adverb.

Verbal adverb modifies the verb or the verbal phrase. It precedes the thing
it modiefs.
If it's necessary, it's despited by commas, or connects with verb by the
hyphen.

Poli ami saluta,
Alex.

Syd said:

So a noun phrase gets a pseudo-BNF description something like:
"NP = preposition + determininers + adjectives + noun + NPs"
.. i.e., NPs are recursive. In some languages the noun's
modifiers can be scattered all across the sentence randomly,
but Glosa is extremely order-dependent.

Not precisely so, because it can be unclear what it attaches to.
Even a proper "adverbial" phrase that wanders can be ambiguous:
"He chased the dog WITH a broomstick IN his underwhere."

> I rather like the idea that, as V, S and O have intro
> particles, so could adjective and adverb phrases

Me too. But the positions of those phrases should be constrained.
English is unusual in its high degree of syntactic ambiguity,
and this should not be imported to Glosa.

> further I should like to be
> able to use particles that define S and O

I agree. Whenever sentence phrase order is unusual, use of
prepositions removes the unclarity. We already have "per"
and "ex", only the direct object lacks one. (I think "de"
might be used immediately following the verb, but that's
not what we need here.) Otto Jesperson proposed "em",
and in Ido they use "na", IIRC.

As it is, anyone can post to this group, and I suppose they also

>

    Yes, in English the text book location for adverbs is AFTER the verb.
 EG  He ran quickly to work.
    But, quite pragmatically, if the Verb Phrase is going to become
awkwardly overloaded through the addition of excessive adverbs, then some
of the adverbs get shunted to the front, or the tail, of the sentence as
much-elided Adverbial Clauses.
         EG  While still eating breakfast, he ran quickly to work, heavily
overloaded.
         If RAN is the action,
                QUICKLY,
                WHILE STILL EATING BREAKFAST, and
                HEAVILY OVERLOADED
all modify this action.

   Can Glosa also spread its 'adverbial' modifiers around in a similar
fashion?  I cannot see why not!
   If we rigidify Glosa's structure (or try to), thus making it 'inhuman',
we might get something equvalent to,
  EG  He ran quickly, while still eating breakfast and heavily overloaded,
to work.

  In Glosa, modifiers precede the word they modify ('adjectives' before
'nouns'; and 'adverbs' before 'verbs'): note, there being no Part-of-Speech
markers in Glosa, ~celero~ is used to translate both "fast" and "quickly." 

  IE  An pa kurso celero, tem du fago an prima vora, e fero excesi masi, ad
an ergo-lo.   [Adverb content AFTER the verb as in English]

Or putting modifiers, where they should be in Glosa, BEFORE the 'verb',
      An celero, tem du fago an prima vora, e fero excesi masi, pa kurso ad
an ergo-lo.  

  But it might be kinder to the listener to break up the Adverbial element
to give him, or her, psychological time to absorb the various modifications
to the action.

  IE  Du fago an prima vora, e du fero excesi masi, an pa celero kurso, ad
an ergo-lo.

   I would hate to say that the BNF model, being only artificially
intelligent, could possibly suffer from an excessive need for
standardisation.  And it might be Politically Incorrect to suggest that
good Glosa, being planned to make sense, ultimately, to human beings,
possibly will not fit a rigidified structure.  However, I do venture such
thoughts.

              A = to, towards (AD is used before words whose intial letter
is a vowel).
              From the above non-contextual sentence, I have surmised the
one person attempted to send the contents of a book over the Internet to
another, FOR practice at transmission through the Net. 
              In Glosa (and in English) the above examples would have
meaning differences - on as far as the emphasis: the most important, and
most emphasised, phrase come first; the least emphasised, and possibly most
assumed, phrase comes last.

  I would rearrange the sentence - according to my preferred emphasis - thus:-

 ~ 5)  Pro praxi, mi pa mite u bibli a tu.

But practical too. A few years ago I wrote a web CGI translation
assistant for Glosa-to-English. Instead of attempting the impossible,
it simply takes a paragraph of Glosa text and generates a *glossary*.
The output side can be adapted very easily to any other language.
And the input side works with Ido and similar IALs.

I think you are attempting to reinvent the sentence parse tree,
or maybe a part-of-speech tagger, or both. These are inherently
difficult and complicated though interesting as tools of analysis.
If a program could input one natural language and output another,
it would be done already, and there'd be no need for an IAL.

*   The "that" of English has two incarnations: everybody know about the
one which starts 'relative clauses'; but the other one is harder to pin
down.  In English, I notice that I seem to use it more than most.  That I
seem to use it more than most, is noticable, in my use of English.
    This second use appears to be associated with the verb, rather than
with a noun.  And the "that" is used somewhat as a mathematical
"therefore."  When I use Glosa, I wish to be similarly specific; thus, I
have not yet been convinced that the Old Glosa ~ke~ is useless, and must go.

*   While some feel (that) the semicolon is evil, I see it as no more than
a mark of punctuation with a 'pausal factor' somewhere between that of the
comma and the colon.  Ron and Wendy chose it to demark clauses, wheras, if
it is necessary to do so necessary, most of us would use the          comma
to separate phrases.  Because clauses have greater significance, the
authors chose to mark them with a divider of greater power than that of the
simple comma.  So, I will not mention the semicolon again, I shall simply
continue to use it the way the Glosa authors thought appropriate.

some spelling out of the meanings in its sentences: I believe that, at the
start, we can introduce some abbreviations of usage, but to expect that we

onto Glosa, is presumptuous.

An pa dice de an anas; qi habe pato. OR An pa dice de an anas; habe pato.
 
  Either of these 'feels' better than the sentences using ~es~.

>> His hat, which is red, is enormous.
>> An kefa-ve; qi habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

*   It is obvious that we approach communication, and the language involved
in its achievment, from different directions.  The ''whatever'' example is
confusing: with usage, things go from whiteness to blackness, not the other
way around.  The functional location in which you placed the "qod", is that
of a Relative Pronoun - defined in Glosa as ~qi~.  So, the ~ke~, which
relates to verbs, not nouns, would not have been used in this situation.

    When Rick Morneau and I were both on Conlang, we did exchange ideas on
syntax, sometimes differing on points of usage: I will happily read his
recent release on the matter - when I find time.  Thank you for the URL.

Saluta,

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary
From: Charles{at}xxxxx{dot}Com
Date: Sat, 18 May 2002 13:24:20 -0700

I've further refined the word selection "technology" ...
and thought of some objective measures to apply to results.

For instance, the combined official Glosa dictionaries
contain approximately 8468 unique G-words that yield
7906 unique English equivalents. However, this requires
12681 entries in total, which indicates the overlap
of the much-decried excess of synonyms in the GED.
Any manual word selection process tends to produce
this effect, but by algorithm I am getting more like
6318, 5743, 6318; in other words, much less overlap,
implying better coverage of semantic space.

Also, it appears that automatic handling of the
"false friends" problem is possible by use of a
clever/dirty heuristic trick. Inevitably there
will be troublesome entries like this:

farin  FLOUR    fre farine, ita farina, por farinha
farin  floury   ita farinaceo
farin  meal     fre farine, por farinha
farin  PHARYNX  eng pharynx, ita faringe, spa faringe

The current algorithm resolves this by selecting the
"farin = flour" possibility and forgetting "pharynx".
It also makes for a neater reverse-sorted listing,
and remaining synonyms are glaringly apparent:

Result    ENGLISH      Multilingual sources
--------  ===========  --------------------
fable     fable        eng fable, fre fable
fabul     fable        por fábula, spa fábula
fabric    fabricate    eng fabricate, fre fabriquer, ita fabbricare, por fabrique, spa fabricar
face      face         eng face, fre face
cara      face         por cara, spa cara
facet     facet        eng facet, fre facette, spa faceta
facial    facial       eng facial, spa facial
facil     facile       eng facile, fre facile, ita facile, por fácil, spa fácil
facsim    facsimile    eng facsimile, spa facsímil

I think using a better Italian dictionary could resolve
many of the ties, like cara/face and fable/fabul ...
but this is only intended as a proof-of-concept anyway.

*  Yes Folks,
   I had a look at Rick's essay, and BNF is a computer technology way of
spelling out the syntax used in a computer programming language.
   Now, Rick is a great guy, but he writes in a rather dry style.  So,
should you check out this essay, be prepared to do quite a lot of hard
thinking ... some of it 'between the lines.'

   Although I am only half-way through it so far, I would venture a
progress report:-
  . Sorry, there is no ready explanation of what BNF stands for.   
  . The BNF system successively analyses sentence structure into its
smaller parts, so that the syntactic definition of a sentence might take
five, or more, lines (layers of ever-deeper analysis) to tease it out.
  . Rick does give examples, but leaves the reader to link the parts of the
example with the actual theory, as stated in the essay.
  . From the limited existing evidence of changes in the gross syntax of
languages, Rick says the conclusion is that languages fluctuate between SOV
and VSO order, with neither being the ultimate form; and he states very
clearly that the SVO expression of a language is considered to be a
transitional stage between these two 'polar' forms.  English and Glosa, it
seems, are both in 'transitional' mode. 
  . Quite clearly, he gives the word, "that" two distinct syntactic
function when it is operating in ''relative'' mode: in the normal one,
"that" is a 'relative pronoun' starting an Adjectival Clause modifying the
Noun, which it follows - usually immediately; and the less described "that"
he calls a Conjunction ('and', 'but', 'or' class) and shows that it
modifies the Verb, starting a Noun Clause when at the beginning of the
sentence, or an Adverbial Clause if it comes after the Verb it modifies.

   So, relating this to the subject of this List, Rick defines the two
syntactic function that the English "that" translates into, when the
''relative'' concept is used in Glosa:
    A. "The cow, that is in the milking shed, needs to be let out."
   In this example we have the normal ~qi~ usage with its controversial,
preceding ";" to indicate the start of an Adjectival Clause.
       ~U vaka; qi habe loka intra u mulge-do, nece gene lase ab.~

    B. "He ran so quickly that he arrived first."
       "She said, that we must walk slowly."
       "That it is going to rain, is quite clear from looking at the sky." 
   In these sentences, the "that," which Rick describes as a Conjunction,
relates directly to the action, and starts an Adverbial Clause or a Noun
Clause.  I suggest, that in his essay, Rick has clearly pin-pointed a valid
syntactic difference in the uses of "that" when it starts subordinate
clauses in English; and, I consider that such a difference also exists in
Glosa when employing the ''relative'' concept, and that the two forms ~qi~
and ~ke~(O.G.)
amply, and beneficially, embody this difference.
       ~An pa kursi ta celero, ke an veni prima.~   ------- a.
       ~Fe pa dice: ke na debi lento gresi.~    ----------- b.
   OR  ~Fe pa dice: na debi lento gresi.~    -------------- b'.    
       ~Ke il fu pluvi, habe fo evide ex u ciela.~   ------ c.
   OR  ~Ke il fu pluvi, na klari vide ex skope u ciela.~ -- c'. 

... to be continued, after I read the second half of Rick's gripping work.  

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S.  It's an interesting essay: I suggest that all read it.  R.

True. Here's one BNF "tutorial" that answers your question...and many questions 
you weren't asking. Stop as soon as you get bored, because your answer is right 
up front. It's just the first google hit, so I don't pretend it's the best

I completely agree with you that the ~qi~ and ~ke~ concepts exactly match to the 
two forms of "that". 

Personally, I prefer a comma before ~qi~ and a semi-colon before ~ke~. For ~ke~, 
it's because I can (hopefully) please both the semi-colon fans and the ~ke~ 
fans, with no ambiguity. For ~qi~, I guess it doesn't feel like it needs such a 
big pause, but I could be persuaded otherwise.

*  Thanks for the support, Kevin,
   I was totally blown away by this part of Rick's essay, and will send an
extract from the essay to Wendy .. requesting that she reconsider her
earlier statement on the undesirability of ~ke~.
   Also, it really doesn't matter whether we use a colon, semi-colon, comma
or nothing ... when introducing supplementary clauses.  When the reader is
engrossed in the exploits of Cinerala, he/she is not going to stop reading
or become confused by the absence or over-use of punctuation, which is only
supposed to be an aid to humanisation of the text, simulating the
writer/speaker's pauses and intonation.
   Rather than worry about it, I would suggest that Glosa writers do, in
fact, use the punctuation of their choice, when writing stories, and
calling on this ''relative'' function.  This is similar to the suggestion
Ron Clark made, in relation to the 'terminal vowel': allowing it to
"float."  Needless to say, that "floating" of the vowel did cause a lot of
havoc, and gained little benefit; however, allowing the punctuation before
~qi~ and ~ke~ to 'float' should do far less damage, and might do some good.

   What really will do harm is if Glosa-pe do NOT write stories in Glosa -
whichever punctuation they might plan to use!!!

Saluta,

Robin

Well, I said earlier that "parse trees" might be more
to your liking. But *any* analysis will be tedious.
All sentences of normal complexity, 10 to 20 words,
require a systematic method for proper analysis.

Your plea contains 2 subclauses, a fancy genitive,
a free compound, and coordination sans conjunction,
5 nouns 4 verbs 3 adjs 3 determs 2 preps 2 pronouns
(but no adverbs of any variety, a great relief).

The simple teenage souls are presently out evolving
some sort of hyper-encoded acronymic chat language
tailored to their text-messaging toys.

*   Friends,
    Though Sid might not be listening, I would like to amplify his comment
by adding that the two words are "proscribed" and "natural."
    I feel that the Morneau pattern would see the 'ideal' auxilliary
language as following a reasonably well-defined formula, while Sid and I
would be more in the inspirational, intuitional camp.
    What the BNP analysis does, is suggest that there ought to be a
proscribed set of rules bounding the newly forming language so that it is
quite regularised; and, Rick does support this with the idea of the
"machine handling" of language.  However, I think that, in the ultimate
situation, language can only be meaningful inside the minds of humans, so I
opt for the more "naturalised" form of the 'ideal' AL.

There are languages that use only one particle for sub-clauses.
Europeans use "que" "quel" and "qui", Glosa lacks the "que":

QUE/THAT ..... "I know KE the world is flat."
QUI/WHO ...... "Columbus is the guy QI is wrong."
QUEL/WHICH ... "Round is the shape QOD is impossible."

I'd rather eject QI and QOD and keep KE, because easier:
"the guy KE is wrong", "the shape KE is impossible".
We can do that in English (THAT=KE) in most cases too,
though there are too many THATs altogether ... and often,
a THAT can be elided as in "I know the world is flat".

> This is similar to the suggestion

I think he was right to let it float.

*   Drat,
    I did a beautiful reply, but must have been so sleepy I hit the wrong
button, and lost it.
  . How does the machine think?
  . Can a hand sort of GID produce a 7000 odd list?
  . I would keep the "1++" entries and a few rare (G) & (L) synonyms.
  . Two years ago I used a word processing macro to 'reverse' the GLOSA
6000 list from Glosa-->Eng to Eng-->Glosa; I could do the opposite, and
take the GID Eng->Glosa and 'reverse' it to Glosa->Eng.
  . I might call the streamlined GID list GID(s) or GID.S; the final
result, with English-language synonyms collapsed into single items per
Glosa word, ought to come down to around 7000 odd words.
  . This is a job for a rainy weekend, or maybe for my holiday, which comes
in September.
  . Meanwhile, before that is attempted, I would need to co-ordinate with
Marcel to get the synonyms finalised, so they slotted into the GID neatly.
  . What takes the time is agonising over whether, or not, a word should be
included in a dictionary; this would be the case with making up a Starter
Glosa Dictionary of 2500 words, but should not be a consideration, in this
case, where the GID is being simplified, not pruned.

   Sorry Charles, I am not yet convinced that the concept is proven.
However, I must admit that such a mechanical simplification, which I think
you are talking about - overcoming the problem of excessive dictionary
entries - could be achieved a lot quicker by machine processing than by the
hand/eye method I describe.  Can you convince me that the quality of the
job would be as good as that of one involving a suitably primed human mind?

It sorts and searches, that's all, but more than most people do.

Arbitrariness of the person hand-sorting is precisely
what led to the inadequacy of Glosa's lexicon.

I let the algorithm do that. Only a team of professional linguists
would be qualified to do what you are proposing -- the first time
this was tried, the result was Ido; the second time, Gode's Interlingua.
I don't consider either to be sufficient, practical, modern, or esthetic.

> Can you convince me that the quality of the

I'm just a techie, not a salesman. I do know that the dictionaries
produced for Novial and Occidental are in 95% agreement and beat
Glosa by a wide margin, and I can reproduce their word selections
by algorithm from impartial up-to-date bilingual public-domain sources.

Marcel has done this already 
  Glosa -> English   http://www.glosa.org/gid/glen.txt

  
And the ++ words in

Marcel has completed his updating of GID resulting
from Wendys replies to his questions about synonyms.
See his e-mail of Fri, 8 Mar 2002 17:51:41 +0100.

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary of IAL roots
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Mon, 27 May 2002 20:04:08 -0700

I've been experimenting with word-selection algorithms,
now importing the Glosa and Ido vocabularies. They can
mix well with the Romance languages, unsurprisingly.
Glosa closely resembles Italian, as was suspected.
Anyway, here is an illustrative example, taking all
resulting NOV- items from the raw data, and assuming
the format to be obvious enough ...

nov    new        4  fre nouveau, ido nov, ita nuovo, por novo
nov    nine       2  ita nove, por nove
nov    nova       2  eng nova, spa nova
nov    novel      3  fre nouveau, ita nuovo, por novo
nov    tidings    2  glo nova, ita nuova
novam  again      2  ita nuovamente, por novamente
novel  novel      4  eng novel, glo noveli, por novela, spa novela
novel  novelette  2  eng novelette, ido novel
novel  novelist   2  eng novelist, spa novelista
novel  novelly    2  eng novelly, fre nouvel
novem  november   3  eng november, glo novembro, ido novembr
noven  ninety     2  por noventa, spa noventa
noven  novena     2  eng novena, spa novena
novic  novice     3  eng novice, fre novice, ido novic

First, there seem to be 7 distinct and useful meanings
among the lot, most of them overloading "nov" to the extent
that it cannot rationally serve as a root unaided. The trick
of using terminal vowels to differentiate them is inadequate.
This also happens with most other simple 3- or 4-letter roots.
I conclude that longer CVCVC roots are needed for the base
international vocabulary G's authors call "Mega-Glosa".

Second, there has been a great shift and development from
Greco-Latin to the modern languages; NOVEL today brings
to mind a lurid daytime tv series for housewives, a NOVA
is an exploding star, NOVEM is the 11th month (not 9th).
It would be worse to deny the modern meanings, confusing
99% of the potential audience for an IAL, than to select
totally new and arbitrary meanings, as did Loglan/Lojban.

Third, there is no way to prevent overlap of meanings.
NOVEL will usually mean "a long story", more or less,
but it will also mean "new and unusual", unless people
stretch NOVIC to mean both "someone new to something"
and "a thing that is new to the observer".

So, accepting the algorithm's choice of roots and merging
meanings for NOVEN and NOVIC and NOVEL, and allowing those
troublesome terminal vowels to just float away ...

novam = again
novel = novel, new
novem = november
noven = novena, nine
novic = novice, new

Of course I cheated on "nine", a notorious case.
Maybe adding a few more vocabs would resolve that.
I'm certainly non-accepting of NON = "nine" ...

glo  enea   nine
glo  nona   nine
ido  non    nine
fre  neuf   nine
ita  nove   nine
por  nove   nine
spa  nueve  nine

This is effectively what the Glosa authors are 
saying, except they chose ~qi~.

~qi~ = that (relative), who, which
 (as in "the guy; QI is wrong", 
    "the shape; QI is impossible")

that (conjunction)  always elided


and ~qod~ = what = that which
   (as in I know what you are thinking)

Yes. This is a good solution, provided 
the one word = one concept monoseme 
principle is going to be abandoned.

Saluta,

It looks to me (but it's difficult to ascertain) they meant
QI to be animate and QOD inanimate, or else QI as nominative
and QOD objective. I think just one particle could cover all.
The authors clearly put the semicolon in the wrong position,
at the beginning of the sub-clause; which is already marked by
the relative particle. Sic! I suppose they want to distinguish
attributive from restrictive clauses, but why bother?

About the floating gender vowels ... English speakers don't
realize we have the same 2 grammatical genders as the French,
a feminine in -e and a masculine in -(null), e.g. bat/bate,
hat/hate, mat/mate, ad inf.

*   Amazingly, I'd have picked Charles as one who would call for greater,
rather than less, discrimination in language.  However, I wish to add
that, as in English, these different 'clause markers' might introduce
different sorts of clauses, similarly - but not identically - I believe
them to have such a function in Glosa.

    My reading of the Glosa literature, both explanatary (in English),
and the corpus (in Glosa), leads me to shed the word-for-word translaion
idea for these particles: there is <bold>not</bold>, as Charles suggests
a

   QUE/THAT / KE 

   QUI/WHO / QI

   QUEL/WHICH / QOD

                         relationship.


   In English, many have trouble with the THAT and WHICH introducing
Adjectival Clauses, modifying Nouns.  There is little to discriminate
between them: it is tedious, but I will answer questions if
non-native-speakers-of-English ask; in this situation they have identical
syntactic function.

   Meanwhile, THAT in English, can be an Identifier, an Adjectival Clause
marker, and an Adverbial Clause marker: these usages all have different
syntactic funtions:-

    He wore THAT hat.        ................................Id.

    He wore the hat THAT is now hanging on the third peg. ...Adj.

    He wore the hat THAT way.      ..........................Adv.

    He wore it THAT all would know he was king.   ...........Adv.

    They all knew THAT he was king, because of the crown (THAT) he 
wore.

              ^   Adv.                               ^    Adj.

              |_ [..............]                    |__ [............]


   And WHO(M), THAT and WHICH, different though they might look, can all
have the same syntactic function ... of introducing an Adjectival Clause,
with of course, the WHO or WHOM introducing a clause that modifies a
personal Proper Noun, collective noun describing people, or a personal
pronoun.  This could all be shown to be so, using examples; however, to
return to Glosa, it seems that the one word, QI, introduces 

<bold>all </bold>Adjectival Clauses.

    An habe tri feli; qi fago mega qantita de sito.    [... WHICH ...]

    An es un andra; qi habe tri mega feli.             [... WHO ...]

    An habe u manu; qi pa don u fatali impakti.        [... THAT ...]

    An; qi holo vi ski, fu tosto ki ex ci.             [... WHOM ...]


  As I have said before, English is a "bastard language" having had not
one, but many, illegitemate fatherings.  Glosa, on the other hand, the
sole issue of Ron and Wendy, had the chance of getting a well-defined
pedigree.  Breeding such a 'pedigreed' language, the authors sought to
eliminate most of the ^mongrel^ elements of English and those of most
Euro-languages - to produce a language, in which the Synax was pure.


  So, we come to a divide: prior to Glosa, words were concrete things
whose meanings were solid object connected to the categories of things
they symbolised; crossing the 'Bridge of Abstraction,' Glosa moved into
the land, where words symbolised concepts; and the ordering of these
symbols determined which function the concept would manifest ...
<italic>thing, action </italic>or <italic>description. 

  </italic>Back from the somewhat Celtic, fairy-tale story, above,
becoming more grounded and materialistic, I would say that we need to see
the syntactic function, within Glosa, as of paramount importance.<italic>
 </italic>Still, being human, and hearing words in our heads .. as well
as 'feeling' ideas .. the Glosa syntactic abstractions need to be able to
be grounded in the more concrete national languages, that we have used as
thinking tools, heretofore.


  QI  =   Adjectival Clause flag [that ; which; who; whom]

  KE  =   Ad    ial Clause flag  (of reason) [that; so]

  TE  =      "         "     "   (of intention) [in order to]

  LO  =      "         "     "   (of place) [where]  

  TEM =      "         "     "   (of time) [when]  

  KA  =      "         "     "   (of cause) [because]


   These are the Glosa particle that deal with most daily events, and I
would stress, again, that they are not related on a word-to-word basis
with National language words, but <bold>are </bold>related directly to
the syntactic/semantic function of the concepts conveyed.  In terms of
"Language Universals," the various Adverbial Clausic Markers will all
occur in the same position(s) in relation to the position of the verb, IE
they are positionally inter-replaceable .. because they all have the same
syntactic function.


>> This is similar to the suggestion

>> Ron Clark made, in relation to the 'terminal vowel': allowing it to
"float."

>

>I think he was right to let it float.

>

*   Can't recall my actual quote here, but, yes, and no: the floating of
the final vowel was a research ploy, not a final word on the language.

    Ron hoped that some pattern of "natural" use would emerge if he
encouraged "Glossa" users to allow intuition to aid them in the choice of
final vowels for the concept-words they used - noting that they were not
(necessarily) specific for different Parts of Speech.  The result of the
experiment could have had permanently 'floating' final vowels; some
vowels preferred for certain Parts of Speech; or a final decision, on the
final setting of terminal vowels for each word, determined on a
word-by-word basis.  Well, there has been a strong majority of
Glosalist-pe in favour of setting the final vowel for each word, such
that children might be taught the <bold>correct</bold> spelling for each
word .. with an unchanging final vowel.

    The GID is a step along the way for settling these finals.  With a
little more tweaking, the GID can be pushed to being a GD, such that for
most English words there was one Glosa word; with, for a small number of
words, a second Glosa word, representing the single synonym.

*   I have tried 'parse trees' and as helpful as they might have seemed,
originally, I now tend to think that they could have been one of Chomsky's
mistakes.  They are so awkward and space-consuming, that the Chomsky brain
should have come up with 'parse bushes' or 'parse herbs' as a simplification.
    So, I will mention here that throughout history, some thinkers have
tried to symbolise the syntactic elements of sentences.  And, naturally
enough, simply because Glosa is a language with "Syntax-based Grammar," I
decided to have another look at the possibility of doing so.  (GAS is
attached)

 At noon, he ran across the road, which was very busy.

 _@ .  ' \!  @ .   (\! %>)_                 .............(GAS)

Tem midi, an pa kurso tran u via; qi pa habe fo aktivi.

 _@ .  ' \!  @ .   (\! %.)_                 .............(GAS)

  Note there is little between the syntactic codings for the English and
Glosa versions.
  While it does no harm to ^blow ones own trumpet^, so far, it has done no
good, either.  One day, I will publish the GAS system as a monograph;
anyone, who, after reading the attachment, is interested in helping refine
this syntactic analysis, and in adding their name to the author line,
should contact me.

*  I suspect that the sort of analysis - resulting in a list of categories
- done by Charles is not very helpful.  By contrast, the GAS is economical
on space, and does maintain the locations of the words, phrases and clauses
symbolised .. using space(s) as part of the analysis.  Also, the GAS
provides both visual and literal dimensions to the analysis.

Romance langs botched it horribly by confusing the question words
with relatives (QUE QUI QUEL), but English did better distinguishing
its WH from TH words (WHAT vs. THAT). It is a well-known mistake in
IAL design to follow that Romantic error. Of course Rick Morneau has
addressed the use of TH deictic words, as we've discussed before.
The so-called "correlatives" of Esperanto are a good example.

You underestimate my laziness. An easier IAL is a better one.

Well, that would solve that. Let's jettison the useless and ugly QOD.
Still, KE would be nicer than QI, which looks more Chinese than Greek.
And why not fuhnetisaiz Q to KU, anyway?

DNA testing reveals that QOD (and much besides) was Hogben's.

An IAL is for adults, not children. And adults in the real world will
never memorize arbitrary terminal vowels.

That would be horrible, but if you want to relex English it has been done
very systematically already in "Classical Yiklamu", somewhere on the web.
It comes with a nice grammar and appears to be complete, usable, and cute.

A lot has been learned about typography and easy legibility.
It's necessary to emphasize breaks between long sentences,
and the substructures within them.

So the first thing I'd do (besides breaking the long block into
smaller paragraphs) would be to either: 1) use the international
convention of starting all sentences with a capitalized word,
and this would be especially easy in Glosa because a capitalized
particle (like U) would not be mistaken for a proper noun;
and/or, 2) leave extra space between sentences, or even invent
a new bizarre bit of punctuation like "double-period" for what
most Europeans call the "full stop". Before and after:

..

As for the Glosa style, within each sentence I find it no-facil
for several reasons, mainly the fault is in Glosa itself, but
also the structure is too disjointed, like a typical idiomatic
run-on sentence in English, even adding commas doesn't help,
but a strict adherance to SVO + prepositional phrases would.
An auxlang should maximize the reader's comfort by using simple
standard patterns with a much higher frequency than would a
natlang. Especially one that relies so heavily on syntax.

I don't think the use of disconnected "ra" is legal in Glosa,
that's one of the special suffixes (all of which I dislike)
that need to be hyphened to their roots for clarity. BTW, if
Glosa used noun-adjective word order (as it probably should)
then the particles like U PLU etc would best hyphenate too.
One feels this especially when a line break intervenes.
Some people hate Glosa's hyphens, but I like them ...

For easy automatic relexing, short of true translation,
from English and many other significant languages,
we need to specify good equivalents for the English
numberless indefinite article "the", and for the so-called
demonstrative adjectives "this/that/these/those" --

Glosa lists U-CI U-LA PLU-CI PLU-LA for demonstratives,
and uses U or UN and PLU as *definite* articles.
It seems to me that U/UN/PLU make excellent *indefinite*
articles, while LA/CI better serve for the definite.

Consistently using UN instead of the unlovely U and
freeing the order of particles, it could be like:

UN FELI = a cat
PLU FELI = some cats

CI FELI = LA FELI = the cat(s)

CI UN FELI = UN CI FELI = this cat
LA UN FELI = UN LA FELI = that cat

CI PLU FELI = PLU CI FELI = these cats
LA PLU FELI = PLU LA FELI = those cats

Maybe CI FELI vs. LA FELI could express some nuance.
I don't know. It's just an idea.

I agree that U/UN/PLU seem more indefinite than definite.

But UN, to me, is too close to UNO and "one". Perhaps we could drop U/UN 
altogether in favor of MO?

MO FELI = a/one cat
PLU FELI = some cats

> CI FELI = LA FELI = the cat(s)

Literally, "here cat", "there cat" (...everywhere a cat cat :-)

I have thought about replacing U-CI with CI, but it just seemed like "here" was 
an important enough concept not to muddle up with "this", let alone "the".

I like the intent, and would *love* to get rid of U-CI and U-LA, but to me CI 
and LA can't serve as the or this by themselves. Any other ideas?

Kevin

My real intent was to get "LA = the" as in other euro-style IALs.
If that link were broken as in Loglan/Lojban, it would be easy to
define reasonable apriori particles. Then MO would be much better
than U/UN, which is indeed the same as "one" and English "a/an".
But as I understand it, the authors wanted Glosa to serve as an
introduction to Mega-Glosa, which imports all international words
much as the other euro-IALs do.

The same word could be used for "one" and "a", or "there" and "the",
provided the syntax supports it. All pidgins use phrases like
"one black cat finish eat there mouse", because that's the basis
for all language anyway ... But it does sound rather bizarre and
might not attract the sort of upscale market desired.

One good feature of Glosa is the ability to add or elide particles,
so it is not necessary but remains possible to specify tense, number,
and other such notions. Logically there ought to be an orthogonal
set including at least { singular, plural, definite, indefinite,
near, far, masculine, feminine, animate, inanimate }. These could
be freely applied at the start of any noun phrase (but after the
optional preposition). By eliding the remainder of the noun phrase,
we obtain "pronouns". So a mo' careful design is essential ...
Maybe we should collect and study Shaq talk.

noun-phrase := (preposition) (articles) (adjectives) (noun)
preposition := ad | de | etc.
article     := un | la | mi | etc.
adjective   := melano | blanco | etc.
noun        := feli | etc.

Cool! They play fine with linux's mpg123 program.

It sounded like Wendy Ashby studied Italian, and Ron Clark
knew some German. And probably Robin's microphone was underwater.
Maybe all British-speakers front their vowels like Swedes,
I never noticed that before; the O and U should be stronger.
(My own accent tends to merge most of the consonants,
politely allowing the listener to project his own meanings,
but at least the vowels are clear and true, sometimes.)

Now, why not generate sound directly from the writing,
a soundex-type program (like the ancient Atari-800 used,
to pronounce English text most amusingly)? There must be
something out there on the net. Simulate nubile females
or Darth Vaders speaking whatever ...

Well, success at last. I found that same Irish-accented
mechanical voice and it is reciting from an endless loop
piped from the unix "fortune" program. I heard this one
and thought of our noble list owner, but unfortunately
it is as yet untranslated into Glosa ...

:         Barlow was a crossing-tender at a junction where an express train
: demolished an automobile and its occupants. Being the chief witness, his
: testimony was vitally important. Barlow explained that the night was dark,
: and he waved his lantern frantically, but the driver of the car paid
: no attention to the signal.
:         The railroad company won the case, and the president of the company
: complimented the old-timer for his story. "You did wonderfully," he said,
: "I was afraid you would waver under testimony."
:         "No sir," exclaimed the senior, "but I sure was afraid that durned
: lawyer was gonna ask me if my lantern was lit."

Of course it required a 27mb download of something called
"Festival". Software bloat since the good old Atari days ...
Now I have to figure out the API. One should be able to dump
fuhnetic Glosa text directly down its throat sans dictionary.
It will soon be the world's most fluent speaker, inshallah.

As far as I know, the word "hymn" can't be used in last phrase. Only religions may have hymns, while states have anthems. But R gimn
and G die hymne make anthem not-international word.

My super-non-authoritative database of true international words
has only "hymn = eng hymn, fre hymne, glo himna, ido himn, spa himno"
for this approximate concept, i.e. a special theme song. In other words,
3 major source languages (French Spanish English) and at least
2 well-known IALs (Ido Glosa) have selected this root.

Stretching HIMNA to cover both meanings is exactly what an IAL
would need to do, in order to cover the entire semantic space
with a reasonably small number of words. The only thing that
bothers me about it, is that H goes silent in most languages.

Controll langs - German and Russian use it too.
I just said that we can't say "Glosa's hymn", because this word is not used in this meaning in literary English (all the dics say
so)! While R and G use it completely for both meanings!

Replace it by "G" - this the way used in Russian...

So in http://www.glosa.org/en/audi.htm should I change "Glosa hymn" to
"Glosa anthem"?

(I think, in the German file http://www.glosa.org/dt/audi.htm
"Glosa-Hymne" and in Glosa http://www.glosa.org/gl/audi.htm
"Glosa-himno" are okay.)

Not a lot of life in this group since Wendy reasserted
control over Glosa. Where there's hope, there's talk.

It was Otto Jesperson, the most famous linguist of his time,
who invented the International Phonetic Alphabet. Later,
he participated in the 1907 committee to reform Esperanto
which produced Ido. He served as its president for some years
until it became clear that Occidental was scooping up all of
Ido's followers in the 1920's. Then he tried to ameliorate
Occ's flaws with his own Novial, which eventually merged
back into it just before WW II (after which they both
devolved into Gode's Interlingua, another story ...).

Anyway, Jesperson left us a wonderful book which is
fortunately available for free on the web. And in it
he openly discusses many of the design choices faced by
any aspiring IAL creator/reformer. In particular I'm
now interested in his remarks on the letter Z at:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/AILz.html

In my own expriments in algorithmifying the selection
of international words from free online sources, I had to
deal with this troublesome letter (like J did) replacing
it with either S or C depending on its environment:

$word =~ s/([aeiou])z([aeiou])/${1}s${2}/g;
$word =~ s/z([aou])/s${1}/g;
$word =~ s/z/c/g;

I'm convinced that it needs to be removed from any viable IAL
because it is too confusing for the potential target audience.

Subject: [glosalist] A Question For The List
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Mon, 17 Jun 2002 09:08:50 EDT

Please pardon my not writing in Glosa, but I am not yet a Glosa-pe, and I am 
trying to gather information.

At the University of Richmond in the United States we have Bachelor's and 
Graduate degree programs in disaster science and emergency management.  As 
part of those programs we publish a free electronic journal that we wish to 
make available to an international audience.  We are considering auxiliary 
languages as one way of doing so, and plan to use Internacia Lingvo 
(Esperanto) in that effort because of the number of speakers and readers.  In 
examining the other auxiliary languages, Glosa appears to have the next most 
vibrant community.  

Can the list give me an idea of how many people use Glosa today, in how many 
countries, whether there is any scientific literature in Glosa, and whether 
the Glosa community would be receptive to such an effort?

Thank you for your help.

I trust you realize that this is an idiom, and shouldn't really be translated 
literally. Perhaps:

No problem. Welcome to our community.

I had expected someone like Robin or Marcel to respond already, but I'll provide 
my own opinions in the meantime.

That sounds great, and your choice of Esperanto makes perfect sense as your 
first IAL, given its relatively massive base of speakers.

That's exciting to hear. I don't understand why more IAL's don't have mailing 
lists, because it is very difficult for a language to thrive without one.

Unfortunately, I suspect the head count of Glosa speakers is still quite small. 
It seems to be most popular in the USA, Europe, Australasia, and Russia, and I 
understand there are a number of African Glosa speakers who do not have internet 
access. I am not aware of any significant bodies of scientific literature in 
Glosa.

> and whether the Glosa community would be receptive to such an effort?

I would imagine that the Glosa community as a whole would be very receptive and 
cooperative.

PS - please pardon any gross grammatical errors above - I am learning

Glosa vocabulary - academic ranks being one of them.  "Auxi sko-pe" was as 
close as I could come to Assistant Professor, but could be translated 
Assistant Instructor (almost not a rank) or Assistant Pupil - and that would 
drive the professorial ranks crazy.

Not all words in a vocabulary can be listed, without running over
100,000 entries in the dictionary. Only the basic words are listed.
The rules for selection of "Mega-Glosa" words state that all of
the "international" words are included in Glosa. A quick check
turns up the following:

eng assist, fre assistez, ita assistere, por assistir, spa asistir
eng professor, fre professeur, ita professore, por professor

So, you would be justified in using "asisti profeso" or thereabouts.
Terminal vowels are euphonic but non-significant (unlike Esperanto).

In GID, il es

So, ~Auxi Profesi-pe~ feno es boni a mi. Qe tu ne amo

Subject: [glosalist] international vocabulary
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2002 12:00:40 -0700

Mega-Glosa includes all the international vocabulary,
but doesn't provide a list of those words. I'm trying
to find them, and not by digging through 50-year-old
retreads of the Thorndike list ... Here are some of
the results so far, a table of counts of roots/stems
that are common across the 11 selected languages --
I included French Italian Spanish Portuguese and 6 IALs.
English is used as the pivot language, because it's easy
(the true reason for so many debateable design decisions).


         total    GOOD    fair    poor
ALL      10258    2388    3182    4688
ila       6920    2184    2284    2429
spa       4547    1825    1612    1080
fre       3680    1783    1197     678
eng       6348    1740    1957    2635
por       3155    1598     809     700
glo       2749    1500     793     440 <---
ido       2311    1396     559     301
ita       2595    1301     635     503
occ       1431     838     365     201
lfn       1348     820     332     196
lfr        877     438     225     213


I have found a total of 10258 word-stems that resemble
the synsets of WordNet, mentioned previously. Of those,
2388 were found in 5 or more of the source languages
(and marked as "good" above), 4688 only in 2 langs
(and therefore not very international). Sample:


10  eng family, fre famille, glo famili, ido famili, ila familia,
    lfn familia, lfr familia, occ familie, por família, spa familia

4   eng famine, fre famine, glo famina, ido famin

7   eng famous, ila famose, ita famoso, lfn famos, occ famos, por famoso, spa famoso


Glosa with its reviled GED words did very well, Ido with
its smaller word list was quite similar. The two LF sources
and Occ's are quite small and did very poorly. Ila hit 67%
of all possible matches, though it also has the largest
number of bad matches (obsolete medical terms etc.)

Increasing the quality of the source lists would certainly
improve the output, but it looks like there are only around
7,000 true international root-stems, the rest being variants.

If anyone wishes to assist with data entry or correction,
it would be appreciated ... However, I cannot expand the list
of source langs to include Germanic or Slavic. The sources
for FISP are at wordgumbo.com, and are not extremely good,
but I developed heuristic filters to avoid false positives.

* This sounds like ~himna~ would become ~gymna~.
  However, I agree that the very religious symbol of a "hymn" may not be
suitable for something as all-encompassing as a Global Auxilliary Language.
 So, I looked up "ode" in the Latin dictionary, and found that:-
        ode(Eng)  =  carmen(Lat)
My guess is that using such a 'neutral' concept as thi would not detract
from the status of Glosa, but would avoid any pseudo-religiosity in
relation to a possible global medium of communication.
  I know that Esperanto has a 'Hymn,' but this is no reason for us - one
century later - to make the same mistake.

  While ~karmen~ is not in the Glosa lexicon, it quite well could be. 

Saluta,
Robin Gaskell

   For my part - trying to get pictures, spoken word and text together - I
have been advised that "Flash" best creates Java-Script code capable of
playing on most operating systems, and using the widest range of auxilliary
software.  I am chasing Flash up, but need to use compressed MP3, not .WAV
files for sound.

   In a week, or two, the pressure will be off me, and I can relax with
Glosa .. as I wish to.

*  I have tried Dragon Dictate (Australian Version) and it worked very
well, but this costs about $A350, and doesn't allow a general 'Listen Only'
mode.  Needless to say, I was talking in English (possibly Australian); my
guess is that, for Glosa, a Dragon Dictate for Italian speakers would be
better than the English language version.

   In the ancient days of DOS 3, I did try a program that converted typing
into sound, but to get many of the Glosa vowel sounds, I had to spell the
words very funnily.

  Possibly there is a Public Domain, Italianate type-to-sound program out
there; in theory, Glosa has been designed to have only one pronunciation
for each letter, so the production of a _Glosa Pronunciation_ program
should not be all that difficult.  However, it sounds as if
English-speakers have lost the plot on truly international pronunciation of
vowels; so, such development work should be done by Europeans - preferably
not Swedes.

*Hello Alain,
   Welcome  OR  Bene-veni.

   To get started in Glosa, you will probably need to acquire a wordlist,
and these are available on the Net.  The alternative is to buy  a copy of
_Glosa 6000_ through Wendy Asby, one of the authorswof Glosa:-
  Wendy Ashby 
  Glosa Education Organisation
  PO Box 18
  Richmond
  Surry TW9 2GE
  England

   Oh, yes; Please subscribe yourself to the Glosalist Mailing List if you
have not already done so - send a blank email:-

  To subscribe, e-mail: glosalist-subscribe{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

  One place to start is the Glosa section of my website:-
     http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell

  The language is in full working order, and there are numerous wordlists
available on various websites.  Owing to some haste at the beginning, some
variations of spelling do exist.  These have mostly been sorted out through
the GID (Glosa Internet Dictionary) Project.

  I did locate table of Glosa grammar on my website, but the most direct
place to start with understanding the Syntax-based Grammar is probably with
Seminars #1 & #2.
  Ron Clark, the prime author of Glosa, now deceased, did not want to write
a Glosa Grammar book, but prefered people to pick up the pattern by
observation - reading the periodical Plu Glosa Verba.  The primary rule is
that one word affects the next ... and so on.  The phrase is the basic unit
of Glosa, and these phrases are either Verb Phrases or Noun Phrases, with
the major word last in the phrase: this is described Linguistically as
'Head Final' structure.  The second major feature of Glosa is that a word
does not change morphologically for reasons of grammar. As in English,
where we have "to run" and "a run," similarly, in Glosa, the phrase
structure and surrounding words clarify gramatical function: the words are
not inflected.  As Ron Clark used to say, In Glosa a word can function,
within reason, as any part of speech.

  The Phrase and Clause structure is basically similar to that of good
English, and so, punctuation within sentences acts as 'signposts' to
indicate the start of new phrases and clauses - where an absence of such
marks might cause ambiguity.  I forgot to mention: we use
Subject-Verb-Object structure within sentences.
  There are two classes of words, the smaller group of 'function words'
(conjunctions, preposition, and determinants - in English), and the vast
body of words for things and action, called 'substantives' in Glosa.
  If you are interested in the possibility of using Glosa as an auxilliary
language, I would suggst that you start soon to put words togeter to form
simple sentences: say them out aloud, and consider whether they have a
pleasant sound, and whether you can recall your originally intended meaning
as you hear yourself speak your sentence.
A sentence that fails the hearing/sense test should probably be recast ..
until it feels right.  And finally, the quickest way to developing fluency
in Glosa is to reach the stage where you can 'think in Glosa' - at first,
in small sentences, of course.

  I trust that you find the language worthwhile.  One place to start would
be to 'retell' well-known French children's stories in Glosa.  I say
'retell,' rather than 'translate,' because, at the beginning you will be
restricted by a limited vocabulary, and might have to change the story
slightly to fit in with the Glosa vocabulary you know.

  We look forward to seeing you on the List.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

No, that would be most non-standard and uninclusive.
Pure HTML (without javascript) and MPEG files are the way.
And the place for them is the web, never email lists ...

> If I knew what ^fronting my vowels^ meant, I might try to ^back^ them a bit.

The back vowels are the "U" and "O" sounds, so important in X-rated MPEGs.
They need to be pronounced with the lips rounded. British and even
Americans tend to disgrace these vowels, but the Scots avoided the
Great Sound Shift and so are more intelligible to continentals.
The sound of "A" is not so troublesome because it's understandable
whether fronted or not -- except when slurred into a schwa.
The only real antidote to English vowels is to live with Spanish
speakers several years, at least in my case. I gratuitously mention,
the RP posh "EU" diphthong is a sickening travesty of a solid "O".

> English-speakers have lost the plot on truly international pronunciation of

I prefer Latin Americans, more musical and always rhotic.
But the letter "H" is a hopeless lost cause, always silent.

Hello Robin

I am happy to get in touch again with Glosa. I've got all issues of PGN and
all the books of Ron and Wendy. A year before Ron died, he said he was going
to work at a grammar for Glosa, but perhaps he changed his mind, or the dead
did not allow him to do that.

I like very much Glosa, but am not fully happy with some little things.
First of all, the important role of context to clarify the sense of words
introduces, in my opinion, some ambiguity. Secondly, there is some lack of
accuracy in the spelling of words, that changes according with issues of PGN
(I noticed the GID project). Thirdly, it seems to be no rule to decide if a
word coming from Latin will end with A or O or I (to be true, Ron wrote
about it in an old PGN, but some blur remains).

I've given those problems a great deal of thought, and it seems to me that
just some little changes to Glosa would fix it. I'd like to talk about it
with Wendy, but she presently has no e-mail address. If you like, I'll tell
you those ideas, but I've no intention to dictate anything.

Regards, Alain

~dina~, for me, means force in a more abstract
sense.
How about ~buta grega~?

tactical: there is a Glosa word ~taktiki~ which
means tactics.
Im not really sure what a tactical unit is, maybe
its a mobile group ~kine grega~?
composed of would be ~ge-komposi ex~.
~dura~ : maybe this can be elided.
~tipo~ is typing/printing.

There is a Glosa word ~strategi~ defined in GID as a
trick!
So, I guess, also a plan of action. Maybe just
~skema~.

~stato~ and ~natio~: I think these are synonyms.
federal unit = ~federa mero~

~libela~ : I think this is level in the sense of

Hope this helps. Im sure others will want to comment.

I am happy to see a new critic has arrived. Through such
efforts Glosa may someday evolve into a great IAL. But I
think there is sufficient meta-grammar already in Glosa
to answer these questions: One simply adds more words
until the meaning is unambiguous. It is a huge advantage
of Glosa over Ido and Novial that over-fussy distinctions
are optional, never mandatory, e.g.,

kaval medik = horse doctor = doctor to/for horses
kaval milit = horse soldier = soldier with/on horse

In some weird situation a "horse doctor" might mean
"the doctor with a horse" but that isn't fatal, or
even a defect in the language -- we can simply say
"medik kon kaval" or whatever to get precise enough.
(I drop useless terminal vowels and ugly -PE suffixes,
because those are some of _my_ reform issues, but
at least I changed Cs into Ks, this time.)

As long as some kind of verbal phrase introductory particle
is always used, and similarly for the accusative/object,
and if relative clauses and punctuation are corrected,
Glosa's grammar is just fine! I'd change out most of the
particles though, like FU -> VA, PA -> FE, ...

For RANDOM, Central Glosa proposes ELEKTI ALI-RA. I am not either happy with
it and suggest ALEA or ALEO (I think words in O are better, when possible).

Subject: [glosalist] A Contrarian View on Grammar
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 2002 09:40:22 EDT

I am a new Glossa user.  I am also not a gramatika-pe.  Based on my 
experience with Internacia Lingvo (Esperanto) and my review of at least a 
dozen other constructed languages, I think Glosa looses its distinctiveness 
and value in direct proportion to any increase in the size and complexity of 
its grammar.  Most of these efforts, except probably Unish, seem to focus on 
just how complicated a set of grammar rules they can construct to make 
language simpler.  Esperanto sells itself on how simple it is - my Esperanto 
introductory grammar book has 214 pages of grammar in it.

For someone who has not thought about grammar in 30 plus years the eight page 
(on my printer) Syntax-Based Grammar of Glosa was a challenge to get through. 
 I do not think I have mastered all of it yet - and I had to buy a grammar 
book just to understand what I was trying to understand.  If Glosa moves from 
that level of complexity to something approaching that of Esperanto, I have 
to ask, why not just give it up and learn Esperanto?

>From my perspective as a new user the distinctiveness of Glosa is (1) simple 
grammar that relies on word position to tell the story and (2) a simple, 
limited vocabulary.  These are also its great strengths as an auxiliary 
language - simple rules, plus not a thick dictionary to memorize (I am now 
approaching a foot long section of Esperanto dictionaries in my reference 
book case).

I have been working on translating a short technical paper on emergency 
response plans into Glosa - hence my proposed definitions posted on the 
listserv.  What is very obvious to me, again as a new user, is that the 
dictionary needs work, and a lot of it, to define clearly what the real 
English equivalents (and French and German and ...) are for given words. 

For example, I suggested polisi-akti-seri as an equivalent to the English 
word strategy (and, yes, I know it is bad Glosa to hyphenate three words 
together, but why?).  The GID has a Glosa word "strategi," which Nick 
suggested, along with some quite useful refinements of the definition - the 
GID defines this as "trick."  Those of us who work in the strategic 
environment identify strategy as the operationalization of policy into a 
course of action to achieve top level goals.  What is strategy and strategi 
to be - a policy level activity that guides the affairs of nations and 
organizations, or a simple trick to fool someone?  Or is it to be both, based 
on context?  Or do we go back to the root word context of strategy?

I think the real area of ambiguity in Glosa is the 1000/6000/GID.  This is 
not a criticism of any of these - they are tremendous efforts, especially the 
GID, and the authors deserve all of the credit in the world.  But if I, or 
any other author, am to write technical or scientific material, I need a 
better product to work from.  

The other comment I have is that Glosa's simple rules have had an interesting 
impact on how I think about my writing.  I find myself thinking more about 
what is important in what I am saying and a lot more about the relationship 
of words.

So my vote is do not fool with the grammar until we know what the words mean. 
 I am sure that the users of the list already understand the full meaning of 
the words, but until they are also obvious to new users I am not sure you 
will have achieved a solid foundation for growth.

In my opinion, Grammar is just a name for the set of rules for a language.
So, using the word "grammar" does not imply that this grammar is huge and
abstruse (a good Glosa grammar could comprise just about ten pages). But the
main goal is, as for words, there is no ambiguity. A good balance should be
found between simplicity and speed (but ambiguity) and accuracy (but
complexity).

> I am a new Glossa user.  I am also not a gramatika-pe.

I've been into Glosa and Interglossa since 1970.
Interlinguistics (study and design of bridge languages)
led me to study "real" linguistics. What is commonly
called "grammar" of the type taught in lower schools
(verbs, indirect objects, ad nauseum) is now at least
100 years obsolete. That is the sort of thing we can
do without in Glosa. But we can't contravene the
linguistic realities ...

> I think Glosa looses its distinctiveness and value
> in direct proportion to any increase in the size
> and complexity of its grammar.

Agreed. The designers/authors aimed Glosa at people
who basically hate "grammar", and this is correct
"strategy" for a bridge language, which will always
be a second language, learned and used by adults
for practical purposes. The model should be Swahili
(simplified Bantu with Arabic loanwords) or the
Lingua Franca (ultra-simplified Romance). All such
languages share many features, and not following
"grammarians" is one of those features ...

> Syntax-Based Grammar of Glosa was a challenge to get through.

Glosa's grammar is just a simplified mixture of English and
whatever Romance language one has studied in high school.
All inflections are eliminated, and word order within a phrase
is like English, modifiers preceding the words they modify.
There are around 50 special words called particles which do
whatever additional magic stuff which may be necessary.

> I had to buy a grammar book just to understand what I was
> trying to understand.

Just do a web search for "pidgins and creoles and Bickerton".

> why not just give it up and learn Esperanto?

I like all the artificial languages, but only a pidgin-like
analytic-grammar type such as Glosa or Lingua Franca can be
learned easily enough by the vast majority of working adults.
Others are nice toys or hobbies or secret-codes or cult langs.
However: Glosa leaves you with the problem of how to create
long compound words to simulate the huge vocabulary of concepts
an adult would need to use in the real world; this is the
problem of "derivation". The solution is to realize that
1000 basic roots get us nowhere. We need to import many more
from the already-existing "international vocabulary".
This was called "Mega-Glosa" by the authors.

> simple rules, plus not a thick dictionary to memorize

The trick is to use only those words that are already present
in the source (lexifier) languages. That is the Norman and
Latinate portion of English, as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon.
There's the winning "strategy" (French stratégie, Spanish
estrategia, Italian strategìa, etc). You know most of them
at-sight without any study, and once comfortable with the
system, you can guess most of the remainder. No pain.

I'm a programmer. I've written software to input public domain
bilingual word lists and cross-correlate them to find cognate words
with similar meaning. It generates approx 10,000 entries like this,
among which one can find the international words:

It's only bad if there is no shorter equivalent. Works fine in German ...

> a policy level activity that guides the affairs of nations and
> organizations, or a simple trick to fool someone?

The bad news is that all languages must work in exactly that way.
You have reified (and refined) the lowly word into a high concept,
but the word remains as it was, a mere culturally-founded artifact.
Above, the stated goal was minimization of vocabulary, but just in
computer jargon I could use up 10,000 specifically essential words,
so we're going to be hyphenating an awful lot, or else using more
general senses. Precision is impossible in the base vocabulary,
lower-frequency specific senses are implemented as compounds.

> I am sure that the users of the list already understand

Not so!

We seem to be lacking a word for 'pattern', and I don't mean 'pattern' as in a 
dress pattern. I mean like a pattern of dots on wallpaper. Random would then be 
without-pattern.

Ciao people! I think I have not made a post (that's the right word, yes?) 
on this list before. Why does glosa have "q" - "ku" is the same sound, yes?
  Thanks for your time (why is that not "plu-tu"?), I hope you are able to 
read my bad glosa! Cheers, bye.

What I.m thinking of is the mathematical use of "random" like generating 
random numbers. I like the entry in my latin dictionary - random .. fortuitus 
and would like to coin a G word "fortuitu" - I don't know whether the powers 
that be would allow it

Many IALs have attempted to accommodate speakers pronouncing
"kw" as "kv". I think it would be much better to simplify,
and use only "ku". But then, as in Novial, the dictionary
gets eye-glazingly thick in the K section ...

But it is possible and desireable to eliminate spelling
difficulties, recognizing that each native speaker group has
different problems. By accepting the hard/soft C/G rule,
quasi-instinctive (by childhood training) to almost every
person in Europe/Americas/Australia, it is possible to
eliminate H J K Q W X Y Z, like a more-regularized Spanish.

It would gain immensely in both recognition and production.
Mangling the international vocabulary by strange spellings
(Esperanto, Ido, Novial, Glosa) is worse than semi-apriori
(Loglan/Lojban) because it's actually anti-mnemonic. Using
more natural spelling facilitates learning, for everyone.

And then Glosa could be marketed worldwide as a first step to
otherwise impossibly difficult (western) European languages.

Ido tries to be "logical" but it is impossible to use.
Always remember that an IAL is a second language for adults,
and if it is too difficult they can't learn it. We must
accommodate a range of pronunciations in the real world,
not excluding people because of insignificant differences.

> (what's "ing" in glosa?)

English "-ing" is similar to Glosa "du-".

> The hard/soft rule is not is not the same throughout
> the european language lands.

We must use what is natural to Spanish/English/French,
the vast majority of all potential Glosa speakers.
It would be nice to include a wider audience, but that
is not possible. Unless you try Occidental instead.

>> Mangling the international vocabulary by strange spellings
>> (Esperanto, Ido, Novial, Glosa) is worse than semi-apriori

> It isn't! It's logic!

You can't win that argument. See the Ido vocabulary for
examples. Nobody can memorize all the artificial divergences.
So it can never be spoken or understood in real life, and
is hard enough even in writing, where you must look up
every word in a dictionary. Logically you could better use
numbers instead of words, with decimal points to mark off
the affixes.

>>  Using more natural spelling facilitates learning, for everyone.

> Well, but why not use simple Latin in that case?

Latin is not simple, and is dead. Whereas half the world today
speaks English/Spanish/French/Portuguese, and they all mix well.
So those are the best sources for vocabulary, and spelling must
be similar to Spanish. Logic! Just don't go changing random
letters to differentiate meanings, because that sort of mangling
destroys any potential ease of learning.

> But glosa isn't like those tongues. The grammar is very different.

Only superficially.

Well, really, it is "KW". 

Hogben suggested that what was important was that
every letter or digraph should always have the same
pronunciation, and that it was not necessary that
every sound should have only one spelling.

No need for -ing here :- spelling = to spell = letter.

"fortuitu" is not really any different from the
standard Glosa ~fortuna~ "chance", mid-way between
"lucky" and "unlucky" [~boni-fortuna~ and
~mali-fortuna~].

Aren't you really trying to get an unpredictable
order?
The cards would already be in a random order, unless
it was the first time they had been used.

"unpredictable" = ~ne-pre-ge-ski~

Indeed. I am just now beginning to find time again for Glo/Glosa activities, and 
am catching up on my old emails.

The first thing that strikes me about this passage is that it is not very well 
written in English. Well, I suppose if you like really complex, run-on sentences 
it is fine. But I prefer to be able to actually understand what is written, 
quickly and easily.

So my first task, I suspect, would be to rewrite it _in English_. I suspect that 
would be easier for me than trying to restructure AND translate it at the same 
time.

I haven't read Nick's Glo translation yet (the one he posted a few weeks ago). 
Here is my own. Note that this is written in Glo, not Glosa. I think that 
Glosa-pe can simply:
- Pretend each sentence starts with a capital letter
- Ignore 'ca', which begins a verb (or pretend it is 'nu')
- Ignore 'sa', which indicates posession
- Remember that 'zero' is used in place of 'ne'

I think it's a bit weak in a couple spots, due to Glo's very small (and 
unfinished) vocabulary. Still, I think it proves that 500 roots can go pretty 
far.

Now I'll go take a look at Nick's submission to see how close we ended up.

Oops. I forgot the moth-eaten robe in my version. I like your word choices. The

I really like 'feno posi kade'. Much better than mine.

Yes, I should have used just 'lami' after the first mention.

Interesting choice of 'place' here. Probably not legal Glo.

Yes, 'eko loka' is better than my 'loka info'. Not sure about 'mini ra', though. 
Maybe 'eko loka info'?

Not sure about 'pulsa', as I think of that as a physical push. And another long 
sentence, which I would have chopped before 'seqe-co', at least.

Still, we chose many of the same phrases and descriptions, and your version was 
mostly very easy for me to understand. Well done!

I think there's a big distinction between Glosa's allowed grammar, and Glosa's 
documented grammar. (Or syntax--I'm not a linguist and don't know the right 
terms for these things). Anyway, Glosa currently allows a fairly wide and 
complex range of grammar elements. Personally, I think the language becomes much 
simpler if you have fewer (but stricter) rules. For those of us who speak 
English, Glosa syntax seems very natural, but for native speakers of other 
languages I'm not so sure. I would like to see a documented, and simplified, 
Glosa syntax.

I agree with #1, although I would say the main distinctiveness is the complete 
lack of inflections. I agree with #2 if we constrain ourselves to roughly G1000, 
but many folks here believe Glosa needs more than 5000 roots to be viable. I 
would add a #3 which is Glosa's extensive use of Greek roots (for better or 
worse).

Agreed. I put in a lot of hours on an alternative Glosa core word list, and I 
tried to make the English definitions far less ambiguous. It certainly has some 
errors, is definitely not official, and has not been updated for some months 
because I have turned my attention to 'Glo' (a smaller, simpler version of 
Glosa). If you haven't already looked at my Glosa word lists, you might find 
them helpful:
  http://www.qualitycode.com/glosa

Strong agreement.

"came to mind" seems like an English idiom to me, but maybe it's ok. I'm still

Nice word.

Subject: [glosalist] what's the G word for ... random
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Tue, 02 Jul 2002 11:08:03 -0700

Officially, "elekti ali-ra". I suppose that could become
"elektalira" in theoretical usage. The authors apparently
found that sufficient. My incomplete database of other
languages lists the following translations of RANDOM:

fre  accidentel
por  acidental
ila  aleatori
spa  aleatorio
glo  elektialira
ila  fortuite
por  fortuito
occ  hasarde

The etymology of randomness began with the French
"randir=gallop" and "randon=speedy". Then some
random American computer programmers got hold of it.

The general issue is interesting, and yet another
ill-defined problem in Glosa: What's the correct
method for finding specific vocabulary? Especially
when the desired concept is not in the tiny sample
vocabularies provided. As a programmer I prefer
clear principles and test-able, working prototypes.
Anyone can invent words or even an entire language;
lacking either agreed principles or an authoritative
guide, nobody can use it to communicate effectively.

At first I supported use of the Glosa "core" list,
approx 1800 items altogether. It is essentially
a-priori, because nobody studies Greek anymore.
But it's completely inadequate for practical use.
Then we investigated the GID, and most of us reacted
unfavorably. If we have to learn all those Latin
words then Glosa isn't much different from the other
western-european-based auxlangs. I've compared the
entire Ido vs. Glosa vocabularies, they are nearly
identical ... same size, same coverage, same roots.

As I understand it, Glosa also includes the entire
"scientific vocabulary". That would be the so-called
"combining forms" such as ORNITHO and LOGY etc.
I've counted 700 of them, there may be 1000 or so,
still not enough to form a complete or usable vocab.

Mega-Glosa also includes "international vocabulary",
defined somewhere as those words common to several
European languages. Most other IALs have similar
selection rules, such as "English, French, and either
Spanish/Portuguese or German". By that standard,
"ALEA" is already a bonafide Glosa word. But until
it appears in official word lists, nobody realizes.

My own program found these for RANDOM: ACSID, ALEAT,
and FORTUIT. But in correspondence I'd say RANDOM,
anyway. It's a new, emerging international standard.
I'll bet Esperantists use it already, they have no
aversion to breaking or ignoring rules, they just
won't change them ...

Yes, if we're adding words to Glosa, ~alea~ wouldn't be a bad one.

Otherwise, I've also just thought of ~minus skema~ ("without plan/design"). Or, 
as it would appear in Glo, ~zero skema~.

I like many of the words you found.  Here I have two official
suggestions for you:
The book "Deutsch Glosa 1000" gives for "zufällig": fortuna,
and the book "Français Glosa 1000" for "hasard": risko.
I will supplement both to GID soon.  Saluta.

Saluta!
Sorry, friends. Now it's very difficult time for me. I have an exam tomorrow and two another ones during 8 days. As some of you can
count, I have been having countless quantity of exams since the end of winter... These will be last ones for a half of year -
graduation of school and matriculation are too dificult, but will be finishing (at length) soon...
These days I sleep only few hours a day, so I in error sent to glosalist a letter to my friend Oleg. Sorry!

Poli ami saluta,
Alex.

P.S. I suppose I've made some tens of mistakes in English in this letter. Sorry, as I said it's too difficult time for me.

The best thing about Glosa is lack of affixes.
We can almost say that Glosa has no morphology.
But the presence of "generics" spoils the plan:

These are non-intuitive and anti-mnemonic,
and would be unrecognizeable in speech.
It is more efficient to use the full word
hyphenated, as with LECT(O)-ABILI etc.
In most cases the ending can be elided but
it remains available for use when needed.

Glosa should remain true to its own nature:
less fussy grammar, more practical logic.

Strong agreement.

However, I would also accept the most common of the generics being promoted to 
become full words on their own. Either way, we should eliminate this special 
case.

This works already with:
  fa, fi, lo (?), pe, ra and ru.
I think, even Charles can accept these ones with stand-alone-feature.


Problems are the Generics with two meanings:

  ma (materi and "more") - ... but -ma is very useful, I think.  I
                             would keep it, though it is not
                             satisfying.
  ka (kamera and kausa)  - -ka is quite useful, but perhaps it should
                             be eliminated from Core/Basic to avoid
                             this homonym.
  mo (mobili and "one")  - Not very useful, should be eliminated from
                             Core/Basic.
  te (textili and tende) - Not very useful, should be eliminated from
                             Core/Basic.

No, and I don't think the public could ever accept them either.
Firstly because they are artificial, unattested in any language.
Secondly because they are too short, are not stressed, and so
cannot work (be recognized) in any ordinary speech environment.
Thirdly because they are completely un-mnemonic, therefore difficult.
Other than that, no problem ... except they're ugly, too.

> Innovation can be good.

But not in a bridge language (IAL). And I trust the innovative powers
of a billion persons working over 2000 years more than that of 1 or 10
people, even trained and famous linguists, putting together something
like Esperanto or Glosa etc. So I'm in the radical naturalist camp ...

Well, yes to that. ... I imagine "Glosa-pe" pronounced with primary stress
on the first syllable and a secondary stress on the third. It seems to me
that in a language that is not used constantly in everyday life, the -PE
will not be sufficiently recognizeable, therefore cannot survive. Better
to use a real word like "-person" to compound it, instead of any affix.

> I haven't really thought about 'lo', but it seems
> like 'loka' is short enough not to need a shorter version.

Right -- and I think we can use bi-syllabic words for all root concepts,
which reduces the temptation to change INSTRUMENT to -RU; I think -METER
is a better choice than -RU. And then we aren't restricted to just 20
productive affixes, we have hundreds of potential compounders. The true
spirit of Glosa is to allow any word to serve any grammatical function,
"within reason" ... That idea is beginning to appeal to me more now.

I don't find that to be a compelling argument. Innovation can be good.

I believe written communication is much more important for an IAL than spoken. I 
think Glosa has some bigger problems than this in the spoken department. What do 
you mean by "not stressed"? 

> Thirdly because they are completely un-mnemonic, therefore difficult.
> Other than that, no problem ... except they're ugly, too.

Obviously that's a question of personal taste. I LOVE 'pe', and have gotten used 
to 'ra', as long as it _means_ "thing" and isn't merely a shortened version of 
something else. In fact, I would have to bring up a Glosa word list to even 
remember what the long form is.

I am ambivalent about 'ru'. I don't think 'fa' and 'fi' are common enough to 
warrant a two-letter word. I haven't really thought about 'lo', but it seems 
like 'loka' is short enough not to need a shorter version.

Subject: [glosalist] Suffixes As An Issue
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Mon, 8 Jul 2002 09:27:37 EDT

This listserv is quite helpful in clarifying for me key issues about Glosa.  
But much of the conversation raises a vital issue - who has the authority to 
change the language?

As long as Glosa is a hobby activity for a few people, it is reasonable for a 
half dozen people on a listserv to continually modify it - to decide they 
like or don't like suffixes, for example.  In the month or less I have been 
watching the mail, I would say there have been at least a dozen modifications 
suggested, some single words, some grammar rules, some definitions, and at 
least one derivative language.

If Glosa is to be more than a hobby, I would suggest the language must do two 
things:

(1) remain stable enough so that new users can learn it, and

(2) have some accepted way to develop and incorporate changes, so that those 
changes can be disseminated to the users.

The argument of course is that all languages are living things that change 
and evolve on a daily basis.  True enough.  But the languages that do so are 
large enough that certain pressures, either formal, as in national language 
academies, or informal, through general acceptance by large bodies of people 
who use them every day in a contiguous area, limit the excursions.  Even 
though use and vocabulary may change I can easily understand a passage 
written in English 20 years ago, 100 years ago, or 200 years ago.

If what I write today (and I just finished using the term mini-ra and 
grafo-pe in a paper) is to be understandable to a Glosa reader in 20 years, 
stability is not a bad thing. 

Let me suggest an extreme scenario - we on the listserv decide tomorrow that 
the clause and phrase structure makes no sense.  Instead, the verb should go 
first in every sentence, "plu" and "u" disappear (they are a real pain to 
remember to put in), and nouns should be written in all capitals, placed in 
the order of their importance to the thought, and followed by their 
modifiers.  How do we make that happen?  Do we simply post it on a new page 
on glosa.org, do I put it on my web page and it is official or unofficial, do 
we ask Wendy's permission (and if we do it, who takes responsibility for 
modifying all of the existing material stock of the Education Organization), 
or do we just start writing that way?

The impact of each of us on the language is potentially significant.  I asked 
a question about "strategy" - everyone agreed that "strategi" really means 
strategy, including Wendy, and off we go.  In reality, a careful reading of 
commonly accepted thesauruses (and I used Roget and Merriam-Webster) and an 
etymological dictionary (I used Barnhart's), convince me that "strategi" when 
originally put in the word lists, originally meant strategem or trick - an 
entirely different word, with a 400 year  different history in English, 
different origin in English than strategy, and possibly not even a completely 
shared derivation in Greek.  I am happy with "strategi" as "strategy" because 
it meets my needs, because strategy is a higher order concept than mere 
trickery, and because it is closer to what the concept of generalship (the 
Greek root) has evolved to become (but was not necessarily in Greek times).  
But it was that simple to change our language, and that is a little scary.

I admit freely that I am a novice to the language and that the list users 
have a significantly better understanding of Glosa than I do, and I hope you 
will take my comments with that caveat.  But, if anyone starts arguing in 
support of my idea about verb first ....

Apparently just Wendy now. There is no official group.
I've suggested there should be one to carry it forward.

> (1) remain stable enough so that new users can learn it,

There have been no changes since approx 1980, AFAIK.
I think changes would help, but won't happen until we ...

> (2) have some accepted way to develop and incorporate changes,

There is a concept of "Mega-Glosa" whereby vocabulary is
taken from the common "international words". That plus a few
very basic rules of grammar should be sufficient; all the
other frills are detrimental and dispensable, IMO.

> If what I write today [...] is to be understandable to

Glosa is a bridge language, an artificial auxiliary based
on existing national/natural languages, mainly consisting
of the scientific Greco-Latin "combining forms" and the
"international words" common to English/French/Spanish.
Its syntax is analytical, subject-verb-object, head-last.
Its morphology is minimal, 99% compounding, no inflections.
That's enough to work with, and set in stone.

> everyone agreed that "strategi" really means strategy,

All word meanings are negotiable and mutable, but Glosa is
not autonomic like Esperanto; even there, the vocab changed
drastically within a few years of its creator's death, in
the direction of "international" (western European) roots.
Lacking a Glosa dictionary, one could still guess most of
the words, though not their exact forms. (But no dictionary
can list literally all of the words of a living language.)

> originally meant strategem or trick - an entirely different word,

A word's meaning should not be overly-specific. Better to
use the broad meaning, and add more words for more precision.
It's easier to learn and use, and more stable in the long run.

Wendy is the only person allowed to approve changes to the official language. I 
believe that technically makes the GID slightly unofficial, since I believe it 
contains a couple words that Wendy does not approve of (such as KE).

I agree with your concern that a language must be stable to become widespread 
and usable. Actually, the reason I started work on a derivative language was 
precisely because Glosa was _too_ stable. That is, I felt there were some 
glaring problems with it, and there was no structure within the Glosa community 
to get those problems fixed.

It's a typical IAL problem, of course. Most languages remain in flux for decades 
after their creation, and eventually people get tired of the churn. A few 
languages, like Esperanto and perhaps Glosa, have become stable but perhaps "too 
early" while the language was still immature. These langauges are certainly 
usable, and have many fine qualities. But in my opinion each has a few major 
problems that could be fixed in ways that would not render all existing text 
obsolete.

It would be helpful to have a way to change the language other than convincing 
Wendy that the change is useful. Of course, any such process would run the risk 
of allowing the language to change too much.

We recently had some Glosa text posted to the list that everyone agreed was fine 
and readable. Later, we found out that it had been written something like ten 
years ago.

> I asked a question about "strategy" 
(snip)
> But it was that simple to change our language,

Many Glosa words currently lack precise English definitions. That was my 
original Glosa project--creating a core list of about 1500 Glosa words that were 
clearly defined. I didn't want to change the language--just clarify it. The 
results are on my qualitycode.com web site, under Glosa (not Glo).

I tried to stick as close to Glosa as I could, but in some cases the definitions 
just didn't make sense. In some cases the meanings were vague, while in other 
cases there were multiple unrelated meanings tied to the same word.

So most of my effort was just clarifying, but along the way, I did end up 
changing the language in a few small places. But my changes were unofficial, and 
most seem unlikely to be accepted into the official language any time soon. 
Thus, my conclusion that Glosa is really quite static.

Which is why I launched Glo as my own sandbox to play in without offending 
anyone or having to try to convince someone of my proposals. Over time, Glo will 
diverge further from Glosa, and at some point will probably be renamed to 
reflect that.

Chicken and egg problem. Galin e ov problem.

Some other IALs are fairly easy to read, more difficult to write.
"Es facil lecter e desfacil scripter, ma li oposit vell esser fatal."
I can't figure out how to properly say that in G.

Be sure to provide a translation if any reply is desired.
More people are into linguistics than secret code puzzles.

That's pretty good -- I'm concerned with "easy to write"
as an adjective-infinitive combination. I suppose you
can use DE (or some other preposition) to suggest that.
Then there's "de ge-grafo" for "to be written" versus
"de du-grapho" for "to be writing", I guess ...

I agree that this seems like an unpleasant sentence. But remember that with 
English the word itself usually provides a clue that it is an adverb. Glosa 
doesn't have that (thankfully).

The question goes back to whether Glosa should make life easy for the 
writer/speaker and hard for the reader/listener, or the other way around. And 
this may be driven by whether you see Glosa's future as being written or 
spoken.

A written language should clearly favor the reader, because any given work is 
likely to be read many times by many people, but only written once. The readers 
may be in a hurry, and the writer is more likely to have more time to think 
through the structure issues.

A spoken language should be more balanced, because there are likely to be fewer 
listeners (although still more listeners than speakers), and because speakers 
need to be able to throw sentences together in "real time". 

I dislike complex structures like Lojban because I think they would be too 
difficult to speak AND to understand when spoken. I could be wrong.

I believe that Glosa's number one priority should be to be really, really easy 
to read. Next, I would want it to be easy to speak and listen. Finally, it 
should be reasonable to write.

Given those priorities, rules that limit the structure pretty severely make a 
lot of sense. It helps readers and listeners a great deal. It also helps 
speakers, because simple rules can be applied quickly. Speakers also have the 
advantages of non-verbal communication to help them get their message across.

I agree with this. I haven't figured out rules for it yet, but it seems like a

Glosa has to make sense to non-English speakers.

I also find myself drawn to this structure, but find the comma to be inadequate. 
I'm still working on coming up with something better.

Using outmoded terms like "adverb" causes this confusion.
There are several very different things called adverbs.
This one seems to be an "adverb of manner". Whatever ...

Making the verb phrase too long looks unnatural.
Maybe "in a fast manner" or "with speed" would best
translate it, because the bare word doesn't really fit
anywhere or modify anything directly.

In both English and Vulgar Latin, they simply compounded
an adjective with "-lich" (body) or "-mente" (mind) and
let its position float. So then it'd be "kurso celero-menta"
or such, but then how to know where the direct object begins?

Glosa lacks a clear marker for transitivity, as does English.
Tok Pisin (Pidgin) has Glosa-like syntax, and uses "em" to
introduce a direct object. They also mark the start of the
verb phrase with "i", so syntax is greatly felicitated:

1. Famina kavalo i kurso kon celero. (Hungry horse runs fast.)
2. Celero kavalo i manduka em celeri. (Fast horse eats celery.)
3. Famina i kavalo a gastro. (Hunger gallops into the stomach.)

Interesting post. I take it as a suggestion that perhaps, possibly, Glosa (or 
Glo, anyway) could abandon direct verb modifiers altogether. That is, you 
could/would not put any modifiers immediately before the verb--all verb 
modifiers would be connected with a preposition.

Moving to the other topic, I don't think Glosa really needs 'em' to indicate 
direct objects, as long as nouns are marked with u/plu or some other unambiguous 
flag. A noun phrase that comes after a verb without being introduced by a 
preposition _is_ the direct object. I'll think more about it though--perhaps 
using 'em' would help clarity or improve overall consistency.

Kevin

Not exactly -- all direct verb modifiers (usually called "auxiliaries")
fit nicely before the verb, but the more indirect ones (which in English
commonly take the -LY suffix) should be rendered with a preposition.

That's quite possible, as long as those pesky "indirect adverbs" (-LY words)
are always prepositioned -- otherwise they float around until they usurp
the D.O.'s position. As in the original CELERI example, where the preceding
direct-adverb seems stylistically too long for my taste, though not incorrect.

The general pattern in Glosa is for short modifiers to directly precede,
and long modifiers to follow the modifyee indirectly (i.e. after a
preposition), as in simple English syntax: "big cat" vs. "cat of huge size",
"he soon finished eating" vs. "he finished eating in a short time".
Thinking in this general pattern, we can avoid getting entangled by
odious and confusing grammatical terms like "adverb of manner", etc.

The cure for that is to stop using Microsoft Outlook.
Getting a Mac or Linux also prevents future recurrence.

Subject: [glosalist] More semi-Glosa experiments
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 21 Jul 2002 13:09:40 -0600

As most of you know, I have been designing a new language named Glo, which 
started as a 500 root subset of Glosa. The name of the language will be changing 
soon, to reflect the fact that it is no longer a pure subset of Glosa.

I offer my experiments here, in the hope that one or more might actually be 
useful in Glosa itself at some point. Of course, I don't expect (or want) Glosa 
to adopt any of them quickly (if at all). 

My language continues to be mostly compatible with Glosa. Out of the 455 roots, 
only 22 are not Glosa words, and most of those are Romance roots that would be 
recognizable by any Glosa-pe.

First, I have added CA as a verb phrase marker. VP must always start with CA, 
even if they are in the past or future. So you might say 'mi ca salta' or 'mi ca 
futuri salta'. At the moment, I have futuri/pasada instead of fu/pa, so 
non-Glosa-pe can recognize the intent. That may or may not change.

The subject always precedes the verb (precedes the CA), so it no longer needs to 
be marked as a noun. 'animali ca salta' is fine. You can omit the subject by 
starting the sentence with CA: 'ca nivi'.

I have introduced DA to mark a direct object. We already have prepositions to 
mark when an indirect object starts, so DA is kind of like a preposition just 
for direct objects. 'mi ca amo da animali'. 'mi ca pasada vendo da vegeta a tu' 
or, with the same meaning 'mi ca pasada vendo a tu da vegeta'.

Now, UNO is one/a/any, and U/UN is no longer needed as a noun phrase marker. PLU 
remains as plural/some, and also is no longer a noun phrase marker. While 
thinking about PLU, I realized that PLU TU would work fine for plural you, so I 
took VI out of the language.

Next, I expanded the role of CO. You can now say CO PERSONA to refer to the 
just-said-person, which would be "he/she/they/them". So I was able to remove MU 
from the language. CO KOSA is the just-said-thing, or "it", so ID could be 
removed from the language as well. 

Next, I got rid of U-CI/U-LA/PLU-CI/PLU-LA which I have always disliked. How? 
Well, I borrowed tricks from Tunu and Lingua Franca Nova, and probably others. 
First, I reversed the concept: instead of the-here for this, I have this-place 
for here.

So I need a word for "this", and I chose LE. LE actually means "the, this, 
that", depending on where you are pointing when you say it. Therefore, LE LOKA 
is here or there, depending on where you are pointing.

In writing, you more often really want to use a variant of CO, to refer to 
something you had referred to in the past. Or you want your writing to refer to 
itself, which can be handled like: 'se libra ca es boni'. (I haven't worked out 
the exact use of SE yet, but I think the general concept is solid).

All of this ended up removing several words, (including many of my least 
favorite Glosa words), while simplifying some rules and reducing the chance for 
ambiguity. I had to add only three words (CA, DA, LE). I think it is an 
improvement.

I have updated my website (including my BNF grammar rules) to reflect most of 
these changes: 
<http://www.qualitycode.com/html/glo-intro.eng.html>

domi -> edifici
feno -> sembla

Nais. Ai laik the changes, do they mean that to say "i like" you have to 
say "me ca amo"? I don't really follow the "the, this, that" business - 
don't they need to be distinguished in writing, not just when you're able 
to be pointing!?

Nais. Ai laik the changes, do they mean that to say "i like" you have
to say "me ca amo"? I don't really follow the "the, this, that"
business - don't they need to be distinguished in writing, not just
when you're able to be pointing!?

<excerpt>As most of you know, I have been designing a new language
named Glo, which 

started as a 500 root subset of Glosa. The name of the language will
be changing 

soon, to reflect the fact that it is no longer a pure subset of Glosa.


I offer my experiments here, in the hope that one or more might
actually be 

useful in Glosa itself at some point. Of course, I don't expect (or
want) Glosa 

to adopt any of them quickly (if at all). 


My language continues to be mostly compatible with Glosa. Out of the
455 roots, 

only 22 are not Glosa words, and most of those are Romance roots that
would be 

recognizable by any Glosa-pe.


First, I have added CA as a verb phrase marker. VP must always start
with CA, 

even if they are in the past or future. So you might say 'mi ca salta'
or 'mi ca 

futuri salta'. At the moment, I have futuri/pasada instead of fu/pa,
so 

non-Glosa-pe can recognize the intent. That may or may not change.


The subject always precedes the verb (precedes the CA), so it no
longer needs to 

be marked as a noun. 'animali ca salta' is fine. You can omit the
subject by 

starting the sentence with CA: 'ca nivi'.


I have introduced DA to mark a direct object. We already have
prepositions to 

mark when an indirect object starts, so DA is kind of like a
preposition just 

for direct objects. 'mi ca amo da animali'. 'mi ca pasada vendo da
vegeta a tu' 

or, with the same meaning 'mi ca pasada vendo a tu da vegeta'.


Now, UNO is one/a/any, and U/UN is no longer needed as a noun phrase
marker. PLU 

remains as plural/some, and also is no longer a noun phrase marker.
While 

thinking about PLU, I realized that PLU TU would work fine for plural
you, so I 

took VI out of the language.


Next, I expanded the role of CO. You can now say CO PERSONA to refer
to the 

just-said-person, which would be "he/she/they/them". So I was able to
remove MU 

from the language. CO KOSA is the just-said-thing, or "it", so ID
could be 

removed from the language as well. 


Next, I got rid of U-CI/U-LA/PLU-CI/PLU-LA which I have always
disliked. How? 

Well, I borrowed tricks from Tunu and Lingua Franca Nova, and probably
others. 

First, I reversed the concept: instead of the-here for this, I have
this-place 

for here.


So I need a word for "this", and I chose LE. LE actually means "the,
this, 

that", depending on where you are pointing when you say it. Therefore,
LE LOKA 

is here or there, depending on where you are pointing.


In writing, you more often really want to use a variant of CO, to
refer to 

something you had referred to in the past. Or you want your writing to
refer to 

itself, which can be handled like: 'se libra ca es boni'. (I haven't
worked out 

the exact use of SE yet, but I think the general concept is solid).


All of this ended up removing several words, (including many of my
least 

favorite Glosa words), while simplifying some rules and reducing the
chance for 

ambiguity. I had to add only three words (CA, DA, LE). I think it is
an 

improvement.


I have updated my website (including my BNF grammar rules) to reflect
most of 

these changes:

Experimentation is good, especially since there is so little use of
Glosa-as-it-is-today. The basic concepts of Glosa, analytic syntax
and international vocabulary, are certainly a good foundation.
Clearly some further evolution is necessary. Many of the ideas
you suggest seem worth a trial ...

> Now, UNO is one/a/any, and U/UN is no longer needed as a noun phrase marker.

That seems especially good; the highest frequency words should
be mnemonic and euphonic, both.

I like the LE, but there's also LA for "that, there". All languages
make "deictic" distinctions like this/that, here/there, etc.
You could use both LE and LA in the same sentence as in the English
use of "the former" and "the latter", or what linguists call
the proximate/obviative. Very useful.

The more natural way is to use "this/that". I don't trust a-priori
inventions such as Glosa's -CO, they never work out in the real world.

> P.S. Here are my latest root changes to make Glo more Romance and less Greek:

Originally, Interglossa was largely Greek because it was thought the
international scientific vocabulary would rule the futuristic day.
But scientists now have abandoned Greek for coining new terms, and
the horrible medical/legal terminology seems to be going permanently
out of fashion. Glosa evolved toward Latin, with the remaining Greek
words so disfigured in orthography as to become unrecognizeable and,
worse, conflict with well-known latinate words. A pure-Greek or
Koine version of Glosa would be very interesting, but impractical.
So I vote to exile them all and retain only modern latinate words.
And then, reconsider the case of K vs. C, as the Roman Senate did.

That's exactly what Glosa desperately needs, more true Romance.
The auxlang that attracts the most teenyboppers will surely win.

Glosa uses K in a pseudo-Greek attempt at pseudo-phoneticism.
This single step renders all the familiar words of civilization
that happen to include a C (approx 33%) unrecognizeable.
The great linguist (interlinguist) Otto Jesperson, who first
devised the IPA (international phonetic alphabet) tried this
approach in his auxlang Novial, circa 1927, but by 1930 he
saw the error of his ways and reformed it by un-K-ing it.
I feel that Glosa should do likewise rather than cleaving
to false grecianity. In the old days, as today, governments
high-handedly tampered with technological standards such as
orthography and terminology (gobbledegook). Latin was never
as stable as we might think, having diverse dialects (like
British vs. American vs. Texan today) and constantly mutating
its alphabet (C G K Q V J ...) I tried to find a nice summary
URL but couldn't (using google.com) but you can well imagine.

glo looks interesting, shall have a goood look at it soon . - suggest as i 
think for for glosa, the shift key is used as little as possible - this 
leaves lower case letters, these could be pronounced as ipa . i like the 
base's being latin, we could recomend glo users having a copy of something 
like [ collins / latin-english/ e-l dictionary or latin/other tongue ] for 
coining words not in glo and translations glo/other languges could go through 
[ for instance, eng -> latin -> glo -> latin -> french etc]  I like clear 
signal for verb/object etc

Unless you listen to what you're saying.

They should have used "c" as [k] in that i think, and used "k" for [C] 
(c-cedilla) or [c] or maybe [q].

Did he have "hard" always "c" (ie: c=k), which is teh Roman, and the 
logical way, or hard and soft?

Why did they have 3 [k] sounds in the Romabet? Why didn't they just write 
"c" for them all - for example "quid" = "cuid"? "V" and "J" were later 
additions though - the Romans didn't have 'em.

It's a popular fallacy to believe that pronunciation
(of soft C, for instance) is similar in most places.
Pronunciation varies more and faster than spelling:
"C" is /k/, /ts/, /S/, /tS/, /s/, /z/, /C/, or ...
and 99% of all auxlang usage is written, not spoken.
As it is, even English speakers who share a common
written language can barely follow movie dialog
from the far ends of the old British Empire.

If you allow either hard or soft, you can always use hard
if you like, as is often suggested in Latin courses. But,
if you use 2 different letters then you must dissimilate
the pronunciations, and then the same old problem recurs.
Logic must be deep, not superficial; etymology is an abyss.
Jesperson, champion phoneticist, eventually capitulated.

The solution is to spell C/K/Q with C, allow pronunciation
to float anywhere between hard and soft. In other words,
accept natural commonly observed variations as allophones
of the mighty C phoneme. It will happen anyway, nobody can
stop it; even in Esperanto people do it, violating their
own rules as usual. Read some Glosa aloud, as soon as
your guard falls, they're baaaack!

> Why did they have 3 [k] sounds in the Romabet?

Random historical accidents dented their logical jalopy.
It isn't known whether they stole it from local Greeks
or Etruscans, with different alefbethic "colors" already
(maybe because the Etruscans emigrated relatively early),
probably both. Romans adapted the Grecobet to their own
mongrel Italic, which lacked many of the Greccish sounds
and changed others (like Z to R -- was it their diet?).
Phonetic debris really accumulates across the millenia.

But we need to simplify if we want a nice easy bridge
language for adults to pick up in a week. Pronunciation
must be EXTREMELY EASY, and Glosa is DIFFICULT. So:

H ->     ...  already is silent for most people
J -> GI  ...  or maybe J -> I
K -> CU  ...  better than K -> C
Q -> C   ...  Spanish does this
W -> V   ...  better than W -> U
X -> S   ...  or maybe X -> C
Y -> I   ...  many langs do this
Z -> S   ...  a rose is a roze

Look, if we're starting with an inventid language, atleat make it one 
letter per sound! "ku" would be "ku", "kv" would be "kv", that's that! 
People are capable of saying both - it's not one sound, but two!

English and French spelling is messed up, badly. Spanish is mostly highly 
logical, but there are still problems. These should simply be absent when 
creating a new orthography.

Just like Glosa I'd say! In fact due to the increased length of words in

Glosa is not a purely invented language. It takes vocabulary from
existing languages, and is intended to enable a billion people
from cultures speaking those languages to inter-communicate.
For an apriori language, better try Loglan or Klingon. Even there,
you never get uniform pronunciation from adults who learn it.
Only children can learn to pronounce a language perfectly, and
they always mutate (creolize) language in unpredictable ways.
The only safe option is a neutral fixated spelling with locally
varying pronunciation, as with Medieval Latin for 1000 years.

English spelling of its Greco-Latinate vocabulary is pretty good,
but pronunciation sucks in diverse splendor. French is similar
though with less diversity. Spanish is entirely illogical in
the way you complained of, since it uses many ways to spell and
pronounce the same root/stem in its derivative series. Add also
Italian and Portuguese to the mix; one well-known Interlingua
has managed to find the common central tendency and produced
a dictionary which is online. I've done that algorithmically
from public bilingual word-lists, and simplified the spelling
by eliminating redundant letters. That's all anybody can do.

>> hard enough even in writing, where you must look up
>> every word in a dictionary.

> Just like Glosa I'd say! In fact due to the increased length of words in

You're right about that. Experiments seem to show that to retain
mnemonic value, root/stems need to be more like FELIN than FELE.
Still bisyllabic, as most Glosa words are, but with the extra
consonant as an etymological clue. Then we must either terminate
each word with a schwa sound (workable) or add a part-of-speech
or cosmetic vowel (probably unworkable).

>> Logically you could better use

> I was talking about spelling dude!

But numbers are indexes. Each language can be indexed and then
machine translation is easy as pi to whatever precision desired.
That's basically the UNL idea ...

>> Latin is not simple, and is dead.

> I meant a simpliFIED latin - and because it's dead, it's neutral.

No good, you must coin new words, BEISBOL LAZER KIMCHI ...
Revise the suffixes and words would become twice as long,
completely un-mnemonic, ridiculous-at-1st-sight. Esperanto
attempted to recode Latin (into Slavic) and doesn't work.

>> Whereas half the world today
>> speaks English/Spanish/French/Portuguese, and they all mix well.

> That's not Glosa though!

Find a root that is in Glosa but not in E/F/P/S. It's tough to do.
The semantics of the roots are also imported to G. The syntax is
essentially Romanic except adj-noun backward as in Germanic.
Glosa is essentially Ido minus affixes (an old joke).

> -o as noun, -a as adjective is very easy methinks.

Ah, the vowel game again. Originally there was light p-o-s marking
in Glosa, but it was dropped around 1970. Why not use Ido for that?
With a little cleansing of roots, and more naturalistic suffixes,
Ido might become very practical -- and then be renamed Occidental.
Glosa hates verbs, adjectives, and all other archaic grammatical
terminology (and doesn't offer anything to replace it).

    What is the next step for the Glosalist group were we to move to standardise the lexicon, and derive functional wordlists at these various levels?  I would put in a plea, here, for adding a few of the Glosa synonyms for the very common concepts, such as "water" - if not at the Mid Learner Level (2441), then at the Glosa Standard Level (5437).


    For me, when I tried my hand at creative writing in Glosa, the avoidance of unnecessary repetition was stylistically essential.  So, if we want people to actually write small booklets in Glosa, then we do not want to put off such creative people by what they could perceive to be the ^straight jacket^ of a rigidly enforced one_concept/one_word rule.

  Re-grafo,

     [get a sentence got-write from me]
       Get a sentence written by me.

   So, Ron pa decide de uti u neutrali akti-verbi, e pa selekti ~gene~.

Dear James,

Dogs can count. Dogs are descended from wolves, which
not only have a large neocortex - the brain's centre
of reasoning - but live in large social groups. So
their mathematical ability could, in evolutionary
terms, have been useful for working out how many
allies and enemies they had in a pack, the researchers
think.

Animals such as birds and rodents can tell when one
pile of objects is bigger than another. But to count,
an animal has to recognise that each object in a set
corresponds to a single number and that the last
number in a sequence represents the total number of
objects.

Many primates have this basic mathematical ability.
But Robert Young, an animal behaviour expert at the
Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais in Belo
Horizonte, Brazil, suspected that dogs do too.

To test the idea, Young and his colleague Rebecca West
of De Montfort University in Lincoln, UK, borrowed a
technique that has been used to show that
five-month-old babies can count. 

A number of toy dolls are placed in front of a baby
and then a screen is raised to hide them. The infant
then watches as some dolls are added or taken away
before the screen is lowered to reveal the final
result. 

If the experimenter has played a trick and
surreptitiously added or taken away a doll, the baby
looks at the dolls for much longer, presumably because
he or she had done the calculation and the number of
dolls contradicts the baby's expectations.

Young and West repeated the experiment on 11 mongrels
using doggie treats. Sure enough, the dogs stared at
the bowls for much longer when the sums did not add
up. 

Dogs paid little attention when one plus one treat
resulted in two treats, the researchers will report in
an upcoming issue of Animal Cognition. But they were
confused when the experiment was manipulated to show
that one plus one treat appeared to equal three
treats, for example.

> Plu pre-parenta de plu kani es plu lupus

> Dogs are descended from wolves

A good demonstration of PLU not working well as a pluralizer
or as a noun-phrase tag. Stripping it down to pidgin level:
"Arkeo parenta de kani es lupus". Yummy! IMO. (Except that
"wolf" should be "lobo" to fit the predominant phonology.)

> Plu zoa [...] Animals [... ] u zoa [...] an animal

> Poli primata [...] Many primates

POLY and MONO both strike me as being apt and beautiful,
but PLU and U/UN are what a Texan might call plug-ugly.
Compare with Ido's nice -O singular and -I plural suffixes.
Italian has "I" for a plural article, maybe Glosa should
borrow it to replace PLU: "u zoa pa vora i zoa". And then
PLU could return to its normal duty, meaning "more".

Subject: [glosalist] Glosa 'plu'
From: "James Chandler" <idojc{at}hotmail{dot}com>
Date: Thu, 08 Aug 2002 20:13:41 +0000
Cc: glosalist{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

There have now been some notes to Glosalist, in Glosa and English.  One 
member commented (in Eng) on the one thing that always leaps out at me in 
Glosa texts: the use, or overuse of the pluralizer/article 'plu'.  For 
instance, in one text, 'plu' is used three times in the equivalent of the 
Eng sentence:

The wolf is the ancestor of the dog.

Now, national languages handle such sentences in different ways, but in 
creoles they are always handled in the same way: by zero marking of the 
plural, because in:

Wolves are ancestors of dogs.

_all_ the plurals are nonspecific.  You are not refering to particular or 
presupposed wolves, ancestors or dogs, but those things in general.  For 
Novial J proposed an unmarked number-indeterminate form in -e, which is 
similar in fact to the creole situation.  The marking of nonspecific plurals 
in Glosa does seem to be excessive - if a nonspecific plural needs to be 
marked once in a sentence, does it really need to be marked three times?

There was also a question about the form of 'plu'.  I agree with the member 
who said that 'plu' is best reserved for the positive comparative.  I 
started looking at creole pluralizers: how about 'nan' from Pu, or 'ban' 
from Fr-based creoles (< Fr 'bande de')?

I think the answer is no, it doesn't have to be marker
if it is clear from the context.

For me, ~plu~ makes things more general, and for me,
unmarked nouns tend to suggest that they are referring
to a/the particular thing.

This is obviously my taste. I was looking at the
archive and saw this

          The dog is a loyal pet.

My glosaing - Plu kani es plu fide domi-zoa.
Robin's - U kani eqa u fide domi-zoa.
Kevin's - Uno kani du es u fide socia-zoa.

Yet another (pseudo-)parser for Glosa ... 

Like Charles ( http://catty.com/~catty/lang/dict.cgi ), Alexander and 
Syd before, I tried to write a little program, that helps to translate
from and into Glosa by looking up the words of a text in a dictionary.

You can read more about it and get it from my website, 
http://www.glosa.org/en/glosatra.htm .  Mi spe; tu fu habe hedo ko id.
Saluta - Marcel.




Properties 

* Glosatra is a primitive command line program for the console.  It
  has no menus, mouse support, graphics and things like that.
* It can "translate" Glosa-English and English-Glosa.
* The program finds words, word groups and compounds with and
  without hyphem in the dictionary.
* It tries to give a suggestion even if the final vowel of the
  Glosa word in the text is wrong.
* It tries to recognize English words, even if they are not in the
  basic form.
* No case sensitivity: capitalization or not does not matter.
* It can use always the latest version of the GID.  Please download
  the new version.
* Load and run, - no complicated installation because of its
  simplicity.
* Runs on MS-DOS/Windows and Linux.  It could certainly run on
  other platforms, too.  The source code is offered on the web.
* It can use standard-I/O-streams.  So it could be easily started and
  used by other programs, even within a text editor.
* It does in no way claim to be errorfree, professional or
  comfortable.

What is 'du', a progressive/nonpunctual aspect marker?  Then why is it being 
used with a stative verb (be)?  It is like saying in Eng:

The dog is being a loyal pet.

My main point is: I dont see why any articles are needed at all.  Lets look 
at the 1928 Novial equivalent:

Hunde es fidindi haus-animale.

In creoles, such nonspecific plural NPs would be zero-marked (no articles, 
no pluralizers).  I dont see why in Glosa you cant just say:

Kani es/eqa fide domi-zoa.

There is nothing that needs to be added to this sentence to express the 
desired meaning.

> What is 'du', a progressive/nonpunctual aspect marker?

The authors of Glosa were/are blissfully unaware of such things.
I regard DU XXX as English XXX-ING, and GE XXX as English XXX-ED.
So a more direct answer would be "Yes, more or less, in effect,
but not rigorously enough for Bickerton or creole enthusiasts".
Glosa is essentially a relexed Basic English ...

> My main point is: I dont see why any articles are needed at all.

Because we must express definiteness and number somehow, but
Glosa does not provide gracefully appropriate particles; it
turns English "A/AN" into "U/UN" but then decrees it to both
a definite and indefinite singular article ... thus confusion.

I know that Bickerton grandly claims to have discovered the
universal creole grammar, but I tossed his nonsense out with
that of Chomsky; creoles can damned-well have articles, and
I believe that Glosa does need one more (the definite "LA").
With the 3 of them (U singular, and some better plural than
PLU) we could all be happy and frustrate some linguists too.

I only meant 'I dont see why articles are needed at all in this sentence', 
not in Glosa as a whole.  Creoles have articles but only uses them with 
specific NPs (either presupposed-specific (definite) or asserted-specific 
(indefinite)).  They usually have a plural def art or pluralizer, but this 
would not be used in sentences like Nick's.  I dont see why the same system 
could not be used in Glosa.

I am not here to defend Bickertons ideas, much less Chomskys, but I do think 
that those designing IALs with isolating grammar would do well to look at a 
variety of creoles to see what can be learnt from them.

I like to view the 'plu' also as an introducer to a noun phrase and the 'pa, 
fu, du, sio .....' as introducers of a verb phrase. it is relatively easy to 
sort out the syntax and meaning. without the introducing words, glosa can be 
difficult to decipher. [ kevin is using 'ca' and 'da' for this reason]

Yes. In normal Glosa, ~du~ is progressive/nonpunctual
aspect marker. Kevin is just using it to mark the
start of the verb phrase. We had a lot of discussion a
while ago on how to identify which word in a Glosa
sentence is the verb. This was one proposed solution.
Many people feel there is a similar problem with
sentence adverbs, when they are not placed before the
verb.

~Fe pa face plu vasa tekno.~ 
  [She made the vases skilfully.] 

Where at first glance ~tekno~ looks to be the object
of the sentence. You can, of course, rearrange the
sentence.

~Fe pa face plu vasa ko tekno.~
~Fe pa tekno face plu vasa.~

I don't have a problem with the original sentence,
which could be said to be "syntactically ambiguous",
but is not "semantically ambiguous".

I note that in O.J.'s book on your site it says

"Indefinite number. ..... a form which was neither
singular nor plural .... Now it is easy in N to make
such forms by simply leaving out the final vowel, thus
'hom' would mean "man or woman or men or women"; this
would be particularly useful in the generic sense
(i.e. when speaking of the whole species), e.g. leon
es kruel, where we say indifferently `the lion is
cruel' (or `a lion is cruel') or `lions are cruel.' "

I think it's fine to say it that way, but I wonder if
you think it is the only way to say it?

Another quote from O.J.'s book -
"nationali lingues non es apti por es mondelingues"

Well, some phrases are unambigous upon first glance, and others are unambigous 
upon lengthy study. I'm not certain, but I suspect this falls into the second 
category.

As I have said before, when I read something like this I assume everything is 
part of the noun phrase (mostly adjectives) until I find a verb flag. So I would 
start out as:

Youthful masculine pleasure-oriented guide-related strong fast vehicle.

No verb. Well, everything seemed fine before guide, so in this case I would 
guess that guide is the verb:

Young masculine pleasure guides/drives strong fast vehicles. Nope.

Youth(ness) masculinely drives strong fast cars. Well, perhaps in poetry one 
might say something like this, but it would be unusual.

I would also wonder if the writer had left out some prepositions, or perhaps had 
 misspelled a word. Or, perhaps you were using some regional idiom without even 
realizing it. After several minutes of consideration, I would probably reach the 
same conclusion that you did about the intended meaning.

Is that they process an IAL should rely on for communication? It would be so 
much easier with VP and NP markers (nu/du/ca, u/plu/da)

juve andro VP hedo duce NP forti tako vagona.

Simple. Unambiguous.

Kevin

>> youth man pleasure guidance intensity speed vehicle

Chinese uses compounds a lot. Add hyphens and it's clearer.
Chinese also has a tradition of poetic 4-morpheme adages.
But in real life they use unambiguous verbs and markers.

> It would be so much easier with VP and NP markers

One could mark default part-of-speech, at least noun vs. verb,
in the lexicon, and then to change one to the other would require
an inflectional suffix or preposition. Or one could say that
any open-class word can function as noun or verb. The authors
have chosen the latter approach, though somewhat inconsistently.
To those who enjoy puzzles and ciphers, the former is preferable.
It is tempting to use the terminal vowel on each word to indicate
the part-of-speech, like some other IALs and Interglossa did.

Yes, youre right.  Although I'm not sure why J felt he had to drop the -e 
ending for the indef. number.  Novial has an indef. art., unlike Ido, so eg. 
'hunde' is not necessarily default singular.  However it seems that J felt 
it should be.

>Another quote from O.J.'s book -
>"nationali lingues non es apti por es mondelingues"

Well here is the weakness of J's e-dropping idea, and why he later abandoned 
the indef. number: lingu, mondelingu !  Not good, esp. when the 'u' in 
lingue would usually be [w], the main stress being on the first vowel.

How ought one deal with a crying child?

1 Pretend that is not happening. Being silent is hard.
The people around you, are looking at you strangely.
You have to seem as though you feel no blame.

2. Draw its attention to something else. This works
for short time. The child learns the way to get your
attention. You will need to work harder next time.

3. Sympathy. The child does want your pity. It wants
you to react. It learns that you are week.

4. Shout. The people around you are looking at you
more strangely. The chid is crying even louder. You
cannot hide your shame.

5. Give in. The child will always get what it wants.
You will have no peace.

6. Make fun of it. You get more noise and more
frustration.

7. Punishment. You get even more noise than you think
is possible from a small person. The child resents
you. It will await its opportunity. Look out!

8. Praise all good behaviour. This is very hard work.
Perhaps, because it is counter-intuitive or because
you parents didnt behave in this way with you. But
the child learns to enjoy behaving well. And everyone
is happy.

Yes and yes. They tried to identify word-concepts common to

Try searching google.com for the latest URLs. Also, the

Long ago we collected and combined some English word lists,

like the old Thorndike/Eaton list (which served as the basis
for IALA's interlingua dictionary). I think you want something
similar for Glosa, and the easiest way I can think of is to
collect "votes" from several people as to relative importance
of each Glosa word, then combine the scores to obtain a list
from which you can take the top 1000 or howevermany you like.

There is not and can never be such a rule in the real world.
Actually, I find the Glosa 6000+1800 (full set) inadequate.
According to the rules of Mega-Glosa, all the international
words are included, not just the ones listed; I'd rather
throw out the listed lexicon than exclude them. (A good
source might be the on-line IALA dictionary -- why not?)

Subject: [glosalist] Isolating grammar

Judging from some of the recent discussions on the Glosa list, although 
isolating grammar is definitely the way forward for any new IAL, I wonder 
whether interlinguists are yet in a position to really develop a suitable 
isolating grammar for an IAL.  There seems to be a real lack of 
understanding, or what I would call _technique_, when it comes to utilizing 
the possibilities of isolating structure in IAL grammar.  For example, I 
cannot bring myself to accept that there is no altenative to using a 
distinctive ending for each part of speech in order to clarify which is the 
noun, which is the verb etc. in a Glosa sentence.  The fact that people are 
having recourse to such devices really demonstrates the lack of any kind of 
technological advancement in this area.

What I think we could do with as a preliminary to any such discussions, is 
some kind of complete (or at least rich) theory of the possibilities of 
isolating structure.  What I am suggesting is that, prior to trying to 
develop an IAL based in isolating grammar, we equip ourselves with a Theory 
of Isolating Grammar.  So that when we want to know how we can distinguish 
noun from verb, we can refer to an established theory which will tell us a) 
what the possibilities are, and b) what implications each one has for the 
rest of the grammar.

In IAL discussions, the kind of answers to questions we commonly ask tend to 
be completely different when one leaves behind morphology and considers only 
isolating solutions.  For example:

Plurals.  Traditionally we ask: should we form plurals in -s, -i or -j?  In 
an isolating grammar this becomes: should we use a plural article or a 
pluralizer?  Should a pluralizer be obligatory when plurality is otherwise 
indicated?  Should a pluralizer be used with nonspecifics?  and so on.

In this and other instances, the whole debate seems to expand beyond 
recognition once morphology is renounced, almost like going from Euclidean 
to non-Euclidean geometry, or from Newtons laws to Einsteins.  The 
possibilities suddenly multiply.

However, at the moment we are absolute beginners with all these new 
possibilities.  We dont know what they are and we dont know how to use them. 
  I think the only way to improve this situation is to initiate a systematic 
inquiry into the whole field of isolating structure.  What we need, in line 
with both TG grammar and Popperian theory, is a device which generates all 
and only the possible morphology-free grammars of a language which must 
express a given set of semantic/grammatical ideas.  In fact, what we would 
probably do is decide what set of ideas we want to be able to express in an 
IAL, and base the device on that set.  I dont think it would be too hard to 
decide on a working set of ideas to be expressed.

I would like to know what people think of this idea.  If people think it is 
worth doing, then I suggest a similar procedure to that which led to the 
Basis Project: first set up a list for preliminary discussions on isolating 
grammar and the idea of a theory, and then, if possible, start an open 
project on the same list to develop the theory I propose.  How about Project 
Isola?

Charles sometimes suggests modifying the last letter to indicate part of
speech. As far as I know, no other Glosa-pe like that idea. Most
Glosa-pe seem happy not having clear flags for parts of speech, and
relying on intuitive interpretation.

Personally, I want simple markers to indicate the start of the "Verb
Phrase" and the start of the "Direct Object Phrase". In my own language
(Glo), which is still about 90% compatible with Glosa, I am
experimenting with 'ca' and 'da', respectively.  I tried 'nu' and 'du'
as VP markers, but they just didn't work well. And I'm not satisfied
with u/plu for noun marking for a variety of reasons that I can share if
you really care.

I would probably participate, although I'm a bit skeptical about what

Of course not. Proven by experience.

All the real linguists think interlinguists are daft.

Linguistics has plenty to say. Pidgins and creoles arise
spontaneously, and serve their people well -- much better
than pseudo-clever projects. Any speech community builds
a common language, the reverse has never happened.

Been discussed here already. Been done, by real linguists.

It was Hogben's idea, and I like it in Ido. But I agree it's not
best for Glosa, just a tempting idea in cases of ambiguity.

That sounds right to me. One can always add a particle,
without getting too tedious about it, and elide whenever
the meaning is truly obvious. Soft rules, not hard ones.

It isn't, though, because it's just another in a long series
of similar "ecumenical" projects involving always the same
20 AUXLANG agitators. They don't know or care anything about
Glosa, they just enjoy barging in and disrupting. None have
credentials in language engineering (or concensus building).
They have plenty of other venues to argue with each other.
I always find it amusing when they venture into sci.lang
and their pet theories get shot down by actual scholars.
What I like to read here is talk about Glosa, by people
who have at least some genuine interest in it.

This solution seems to be more fitting to an isolating grammar.  However, 
the first question that comes into my head is: if the different parts of 
speech are easily identifiable in natural isolating languages, then what 
methods to those langs employ?  And the answer is that we really have no 
idea, because no-one has ever done a detailed study of these langs to find 
out.  This, of course, would form part of the isolating grammar project.

>I would probably participate, although I'm a bit skeptical about what

I will probably not even set up the list for several months, as the Basis 
Project takes priority.  So I will leave you to think about it for a while.

I noticed that Rick Morneau has finally HTMLized his monumental
"design document" Lexical Semantics, and has changed his ontology
in an interesting way. I think it could be borrowed as an outline
to arrange Glosa concept-words. See appendix C (if interested):
http://www.srv.net/~ram/lexical_semantics.html

Another approach is WordNet's hierarchy. They now have a
much nicer interface, though it's still a generation behind
(Tcl/Tk instead of HTML/CGI). And it's a 12mb download:
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

In each case, the nouns are more relevant to Glosa vocab
selection than are the verbs/etc.

The world premiere of what is believed to be the first
ever Cornish feature film took place in front of a
select audience of peers and MPs at the Palace of
Westminster yesterday.

Bitter Sweet, which was filmed entirely in Cornwall
using a Cornish cast speaking the Cornish language, is
a story of love that becomes corrupted by drugs. 

Actress Helen Rule, who plays the female lead Becky,
said it was difficult at first to grasp the text. 

"It was pretty tough. I've never seen Cornish written
out and to look down at it on paper, it was difficult
to learn. 

"But it was easy to pick up, once I got the different
pronunciations." 

"I hope it raises the profile of the Cornish language
and makes more people aware of it, it is important
that people are aware of the language," said Mr
Kovacs, the film-maker. 

This just happens to be the first Cornish feature
film but many more will come, I'm making another film
in the language."

I think about it quite differently. For me, ~gene~ is very intimately
connected to the "verb" itself. ~gene face~ is almost like a single word
for me--it is certainly a single concept. The inverted form of "to make"
is "to be made". I don't think of it in terms of shifting phrases
around.

Moving the ~gene~ (or ~ge~) away from the verb makes it VERY difficult
for me to understand the sentence.

I can't understand dog-Glosa, but it seemed to be a complaint
about the NO and NE prefixes. If you dislike them, then use
NEGA and NULI instead. (Just don't say NO.)

Yes, I mentioned this problem several months ago. My guess is that the
GID is merely inconsistent. Which, of course, leads me to believe that a
language should not have two words that are that close in sound and
appearance, while being similar but distinct in meaning. If even the
language creators are confused by them, what are the rest of us supposed
to do?

I stand by my 'ne'=without (0), 'no'=oposite (-1). If anyone has more
authoritative, or more helpful definitions of 'ne' and 'no', I would
like to hear them.

I compiled the "Glosa Basic Reference" which first went up on the world
wide web several years ago.  Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby approved it.  In
the "GBR" 'ne' is "not" and 'no-' forms opposites.  Without going back
to look, I don't know whether these are the ways things are defined in
other G.E.O. publications or not.  One thing that was awkward when I
got interested in Glosa some years ago was some inconsistency in
publications.

My suggestion is that it is more consistent with GID
and international usage of non- to define it as
~holo ne~ [not at all], a kind of English-language
opposite, as opposed to an Esperanto/Ido one. And to
define ne- as ~ne holo~ [not entirely/not
completely].

An example from GBR ~non-ofero~ is [withhold] and not
request to have back. 

[By the way, I think GBR is still the best thing we've
got on  Glosa grammar. 18 Steps is more up to date
but requires a lot more work to find out what you want
to know.]

There are 2 problem words (rather than a dozen or so
with the Esp/Ido understanding of opposite) that
strike me immediately ~no-face~ and ~no-pli~ which I
think are due to the English words unmake and
unfold. English un-, in general, mean ~holo ne~,
dont you think? If I made up a word, say "unbushy",
what would that mean to you?

I think the words "destroy" and "unfold" ought to have
been ~versi-face~ and ~versi-pli~. 

{~versi~ [back to begin; back to start; back; replace;
restore; return; reversal; reverse]}

Nick

BUT ... with the judicial addition of a couple of NOUN PHRASE Markers it
could be meaningful; I would also prefer ~argo~ [drive] to ~duce.~

  Assuming singularity:-
   U juve andro hedo duce u forti tako vagona.
   [The young man happily drives the very fast car.]
     OR
   [The young man enjoys to_drive/driving the very fast car.]

>"Young men enjoy driving very fast cars."

  If, as I discover, the 'target language' sentence is in the plural, then
I simply alter subtly the NOUN PHRASE Markers to indicate this fact:-
   Plu juve andro hedo duce plu forti tako vagona.
   [Young men enjoy driving very fast cars.]

  And with a couple of changes to make the Glosa more to my liking, I swap
main Verbs and abbreviate the Quantitative modifier:-
   Plu juve andro hedo argo plu fo tako vagona.
   [Young men enjoy driving/to_drive very fast cars.]

Cc: glosalist{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

The following passage may throw some light on the debate about how/whether 
to mark PoS in an isolating language:

Because Vietnamese does not use inflectional morphology to distinguish 
different parts of speech, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a 
given item is a verb, noun or adjective, apart from its syntactic context. 
This has led some researchers to claim that such form-class distinctions are 
purely functionally-determined in Vietnamese (and other isolating 
languages); that is, the label of a particular item is entirely a function 
of its syntactic distribution. A more extreme version of this argument is 
the claim that form-class distinctions drawn from IndoEuropean languages, 
for example, the distinction between verbs and adjective, are inapplicable 
to isolating languages. To counter such claims, the task of the universalist 
is to find evidence that distinguishes proposed form-classes independently 
of their syntactic distribution.

This is from the Vietnamese Grammar Project reference grammar, section 4.1:

The important point to realize is that 99% of all people
despise grammar (and grammarians, the other 1%) and so
Glosa does not want the damned Espo-Ido POS vowels.
It makes little sense even in pseudo-agglutinative IALs
because there are more than 5 necessary POS, even the
ancient grammarians knew that.

I require some information on which moods are expressible in the languages 
which I am not an expert on: LsF, Glosa, Interlingua, Occidental.

In Esp and Ido, conditional is expressed by -us, and imperative, optative 
and hortative by -u/-ez:  me vidus, videz!, li videz!, ni videz!

In Novial, conditional is by vud, imperative by the simple ground form, 
optative by mey, and hortative by let:  me vud vida, vida!, mey les vida!, 
let nus vida!

Which of these moods are expressible in the other RefList langs, and how?

Thanks.

Occidental has such a vocabulary. I have found it to be a
frustration, a hindrance, no help at all. The learner will
be unable to find what he wants, and then grow weary of
coining new compounds for common notions; amateur etymologists
are not easy to train. It would be far better to have a
complete and comprehensive word list, and if possible there
should also be a good-enough translation program available
on the web. Only then will we see any significant number
of people writing in Glosa, and only then will people have
much chance of understanding that which gets posted.

    Please note that the original post did not appear in the AUXLANG
list, but rather in Auxlang-Dialog, which is a separate list.  I
forwarded it because I considered it to be an entirely legitimate
request for information about Glosa which members of this list might
best be able to answer.

    I do not agree.  I think that Hogben showed, with the original
Interglossa, that a carefully chosen vocabulary can be operated well. 
The key, as I see it, is to know the vocabulary thoroughly, so that one
is at home in it, so to speak.  The Voice of America, as I recall,
makes international radio broadcasts in a limited vocabulary, Special
English I think it is called, of around 2000 words, apart from proper
names (and, presumably, the residual inflected forms that English has).

How disingenuous you are to say that, when you know perfectly well
that it is the same old group of AUXLANG-ers. You, Jay, James,
and the other AUXLANGers who are tired of arguing with each other
and need to invade all other groups in search of fresh blood.

    If you choose to be impolite, there is not much I can do about
that.  However, I repeat to other members of Glosalist that I posted
what I consider to be an entirely reasonable and appropriate request
for information about Glosa.

I would really prefer that you (Charles) keep your anti-AUXLANG flames
to yourself, or post them on AUXLANG itself. I find them to be
inappropriate here. Again, the original message itself seemed perfectly
reasonable.

I would answer the question, but don't feel qualified to do so.

Let me annotate this for you, Kevin:

> > > How disingenuous you are to say that, when you know perfectly well

Paul Bartlett has known James Chandler and Jay Bowks for years.
They pal around on AUXLANG and make periodic forays into every
single discussion group related to artificial languages.
Their purpose is only to distract or disrupt.

> > If you choose to be impolite, there is not much I can do about that.

It was not "impolite" to call him on his little trick of
denying that this most recent incursion was coming from
the usual band of AUXLANG creeps. Why did he take the time
to deny it?

> You simply lied and got caught lying. Typical AUXLANGer.

Typical because AUXLANGers are famous for these tactics,
transparently false except to newcomers. You've said you
aren't interested in history, but that's your mistake:
History tells you all you need to know about the present.

> I would really prefer that you (Charles) keep your

Fuck off, Kevin.

Paul,

Thanks for forwarding my request for information to Glosalist.  I was going 
to say something about the disgraceful outburst by Charles Catty that 
greeted your message, but it seems now I dont have to, because Charles has 
since disgraced himself with an even more disgraceful outburst, this time 
involving expletives.

I will just say that if a member of one my lists ever attacked another 
member using language of that kind, they would get a stern first warning, 
and no second warning about their conduct.  I wonder what action the owner 
of Glosalist will decide to take.

I know what action was taken against you for invading the Occ list,
James. Your stooge Jay Bowks has been intercepted there several times
under various aliases with several viruses. (So why didn't you thank
him, too?) This has been just another typical AUXLANGer operation.
The result is that every unmoderated IAL forum gets destroyed,
and you again have only each other to argue with.

I think Kevin's experiment with Glo shows that a small
well chosen vocabulary is all that is needed for
effective communication. If Glosa is intended to be
used by people, who don't speak a European language, a
small vocabulary is a definite advantage.

Glosa has the "conditional mood" particle ~sio~.

What is going on here?  My posts to Glosalist seem to be being intercepted.  
Is Charles Catty moderating this list or something?  If so, you people dont 
know what you've got.  I do: trouble.

I would like to know whether my posts are being allowed through to 
Glosalist, and if not why not.  If I am not a legitimate member of this 
list, I would like an explanation as to why not.

For the record, I have no covert arrangement or association with any other 
auxlanger, Jay Bowks, Bob Petry or Paul Bartlett included.  I will admit to 
having exchanged personal mails from time to time with the latter two, but 
this has never involved any kind of conspiracy between us.  We are all 
independent people with our own views and ideas.  If Charles doesnt like it 
because those views dont always agree with his own, then that is his problem 
and no-one else's.

Kordiale,
James Chandler

Look Catty,
I'm no one's stooge, 
I'll refrain from saying
what I feel like saying
to you in response because
I'm not going to be losing
my religion over your taunts.

I have not had anything to
do with any viruses. For 
you to be accusing me of
this is an outright lie. Some
thing that you obviously
are used to doing.

When Bob claimed that 
I'd somehow "attacked"
his website, I actually
only visited enough to 
read through his pages.
He's got it rigged where
once you visit, every request
for a graphic on the page
he counts as a visit. And if
you have your browser
refresh it doubles every 
time, so if you go to the
index and then run through
the links on the page you
end up racking up incredible
amounts of hits, actually he
is either using this to inflate
the numbers of visitors 
deliberately, without my help, 
or he doesn't know any better.
But I did nothing except visit
the pages and read what
he had put on the web. 

There's nothing wrong
in looking at public pages,
is there?

No one in any of the lists
I belong to has ever claimed
to have received a virus from
my machines, nor my server.
You seem to thrive in making
unjustified accusations and 
then offer no proof, while
underhandedly trying to shut
off people's access by falsely
accusing them of wrongdoing
to their ISP's. There are words
to describe what you do, Catty,
but I think it beneath me to 
sink that low.

Since,
Jay B.

I find your assertion that I lied to be both false

Dear Shelly,
I don't know what
Catty (Charles) is
up to, but I've been
on this Glosa list
for years and even
precede him as a
member of it. I haven't
been as active in glosa
list because of other
projects, but whenever
he and I have exchanged
messages he's only shown
this inimical attitude and
I've found it impossible
to have an intelligent
conversation with him
over anything.

I believe the list owner
is Robin, and he can and
I hope will do something
about his language. I also
agree it's uncalled for and
no one should have to put
up with it.

Since,
Jay B.

    Several years ago, using only the materials that went into the
Glosa Basic Reference, I exchanged two letters each way with a man in
China who said that he knew only a little English, and I know none of
the languages of China.  We were able to communicate.

    I my experience, it comes down to the level of communication
intended.  For basic communication between individuals of dissimilar
native tongues, I support the idea of a well-chosen vocabulary which is
not too large.  If one wants to write a Nobel-prize-winning novel, that
may be a different matter.

Catty,
You're barking up
the wrong tree. I 
really feel sorry for
your paranoia, you
should get help.

And the bit about
"evolution", don't
even think about
putting down my
religious beliefs 
regarding creation, 
perlas ante porcos,
you've got no 
appreciation for
the Truth. Too

The 12th volume of the dictionary has been published.

The final volume of a unique dictionary of the Scots
language has been published. 

The Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (DOST) was
originally proposed in 1919 by Sir William Craigie, a
Scottish member of the team which produced the Oxford
English Dictionary (OED). 

The work, which has been supported by Scottish
universities and charitable foundations and is
published by Oxford University Press, aims to define
and preserve Lowland Scots, which many people speak. 

Academics said completion of the dictionary required
great scholarship and perseverance. 

It contains the building bricks of the language of
Lowland Scotland and is based on a million quotations
from the Middle Ages to the 17th Century. 

Sir William Craigie suggested that the OED should be
followed by other reference works including a
Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue, the first
volume of which, A to C, was published in 1937. 

It has taken another 65 years for the final volume to
be finished. 

The team who worked on the dictionary gathered at a
conference at Glasgow University on Saturday to
celebrate the end of the project. 

Senior editor, Marace Dareau, gave the keynote speech
and said Scots need to have their language recognised
in its own right. 

The editor said: "When a wee Scottish kid goes to
school speaking Scots, he's sat down and taught to
read and write in English, another language. 

"His reality is not acknowledged and this is bound to
lead to a lack of self esteem. He's being told 'what
you come here and offer is not good enough'." 

The 12-volume dictionary costs just over £2,000 and
will be accessible through the internet in 2004.

Date: Tue, 27 Aug 2002 11:01:06 EDT

Posted on the Notes on The Science of Extreme Situations are two new pages 
that use Glosa:

Notes front page is: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/notes.htm

The Glossary is at: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/glossary.htm

A journal article in Glosa is: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/notesiapgl.htm

Notes is a peer reviewed technical journal in disaster science.  Obviously 
our pages are a work in progress.  I would appreciate the members of the list 
who are actual Glosa users reading the article, comparing it against the 
English text, and assisting in correcting any of my errors (of which I assume 
there are a number).  

Our intent is to eventually offer all articles we publish in English, other 
hemispheric languages, Internacia Lingvo, and Glosa.  We see this as a 
serious long term effort by our University's Emergency Management and 
Disaster Science department to support Glosa as an international disaster 
technical language.

I thought G6000 was a good idea. One had 6000 E words which led one to 1000G 
ones. I should like something one those lines and which included useful 
compounds of G1000 words so that I could look up in my 15000 E word list and 
find something there already put into G. Idleness on my part but useful for

From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com

The idea that 1000 roots can generate a realistic vocabulary
was already disproven over a century ago by Esperanto, which
had the advantage of a large set of derivational suffixes.
The inevitable result was that Espists added thousands more
roots to fill the gaps. Glosa's authors did recognize that
Hogben's original idea of a minimal vocabulary was unworkable,
and selected a bunch more from the obvious (Romance) sources.
Now there remains a core set of Greek-derived words re-spelled
so as to conflict with the Latinate majority -- similar to the
English high-frequency Anglo-Saxon roots uneasily mixing with
the more "learned" (and more international) Latinate ones.
I doubt this will be resolved any time soon ...

Sid,

You are thinking of "5000 English into Glosa 1000".
"Glosa 6000" lists additional Glosa words beyond the
"Central Glosa 1000" list.

Subject: [glosalist] Archiving my Glosa pages
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: 14 Sep 2002 21:13:13 -0700

I plan to remove most or all of my Glosa materials from my website over
the next few weeks. Assuming someone thinks they have value to the Glosa
community, I would like to transfer them to someone who might keep them
online. Please contact me off-list if you are interested in adopting any
of these pages. There are also two Russian files, written by someone
else, that could use a new home. 

As many of you know, my own goals have been diverging from those of the
Glosa community for a while. I have been frustrated with the imprecision
and complexity of the Glosa vocabulary, and with the inability to make
any progress towards cleaning up the syntax. The Glosa community seems
happy with Glosa in its present form, which I dislike, but respect.

What finally convinced me that I should distance myself from Glosa is
that one of the list members has recently treated several people very
rudely, without provocation. He has attacked "outsiders" who have
expressed an interest in Glosa, which reflects poorly on this community.
None of the core Glosa-pe have expressed any concern about this, and as
far as I know, no action was taken against this list member.

That's fine. It's your list and you are welcome to write what you want,
respond how you wish, and manage the list culture and membership as you
see fit. However, as a consequence, I no longer feel that this list is
compatible with my own values and goals.

It has been a fun couple years. I have learned a lot, and have enjoyed
many of our conversations. I wish each of you the best (including those
folks that I disagree with).

Vale,

Kevin

plu karo ami
mi sio volu poko dice de u evolve de plura
ge-face lingua, e per u-ci analizi logi qo-ka
in Glosa na habe plura elementa qi es veri akme
de neo e ge-evolve lingua. Kron pe face lingua
qi ne es natura lingua, kosa mo a qi pe puta es
ke u-ci lingua debi es maxi facili posibili...e
u-ci koncepa es fo importa, ka in plura natura
lingua il es plura elementa qi ne es nece pro 
korekti logi u frasi. U exempla mo in u-ci kampu
es u lingua qi gene nima Volapük, e qi es fo paleo
lingua ....in "ge-face lingua landa",
u andro qi pa face u-ci lingua pa puta ke es nece
habe in lingua plura kaso : nominativi, akuzativi
dativi,genitivi....ka an pa es deutsch e pa puta
in an matri lingua kron an pa akti u-la lingua.
Nu-di na pote facili logi ke lingua qi absoluti ne
habe plura kaso es iso foto iso lingua qi habe mu.
U lexi pro exempla :fat (patri)
                     fati (patri akuz.)
                     fata (de u patri gen.)
                     fate  (a patri dat.)
fat binom in dom  (patri es in domi.)
givob fate buki    (mi dona a patri u bibli.)
dom fata binon jönik  (domi de patri es kali.)
lofob fati  (mi filo u patri.).
Na pote facili vide ke per Glosa na evita plura kaso sed 
na expresi homo koncepa,...so qo-ka na debi habe komplika 
elementa qi es plura kaso.
Hetero ge-face lingua, Esperanto ko-co pa uti 
koncepa de kaso sed solo mo: u kaso akuzativi
Mi legas la libron. (mi lekto u bibli.)
e u-la elementa fo komplika u doci de u-ci lingua..ka in 
Esperanto kaso akuzativi habe ko-co signifi de tem, e de 
kine qi plura homi qi dice latino plu lingua ne pote 
facili logi......
pro exempla : la kato saltas en la skatolon 
qi volu dice u felis salta in u teka...e qi volu indika ke 
u zoa pa akti kine pro salti in u teka....qe u-la es 
nece...pro salti pe debi nece akti kine..alo ne? Neo 
versio de Esperanto pro 
exempla Ido pa trakto ab u-la no-nece elementa...e id fo 
boni pa akti. Hetero elementa qi na ne nece pro logi es  u 
sufixi de infinitivum qi exempla
hetero ge-face lingua oti sed Glosa korekte ne habe. 
Exempla Esperanto habe -i  lavi, diri, uzi,Volapük habe 
-ön, lemön,pükön,lofön, 
Ido habe -ar, parolar, vidar, skribar, solo 
Novial 1930 pa logi u-ci koncepa e in Novial 1930 na ne 
habe sufixi pro indika u infinitivum....
sed hetero lingua iso Occidental pa uti id...
e Interlingua habe tri sufixi pro indika u 
infinitivum...dicer,finir,voler,amar, e u-la es efekti 
no-nece.U plurali de plu lexi ne es nece pro logi u 
koncepa de frazi...ko-co natura lingua iso pro exempla 
indonesian e kwetchua ne uti sufixi pro indika plurali, 
sed mu indikas plurali solo kron id es absoluti nece per 
ante-lexi..iso in Glosa...Panto-pe ski ke na habe bi oku, 
bi poda, bi kiro, bi pedi...e ke na nece bi poda-te, bi 
pedi-te....et cetera...sed maxi mero de ge-face lingua uti 
u morfo pro indika plurali...
pro mea ab verbo ad lexi na ne nece sufixi, sed kontextu 
de frazi dic a na korekti sensu...
u eko  the living
u kanta  the singing
sed mi pote dic  "u ju-fe kanta ...."
alo "u kanta de ju-fe pa es fo kali..."
Na debi fo boni ski plu karakteri boni de na lingua...pro

pro plu difere funktio de mo concepa.
    Mi ne logi u signifi de tu stresi ke un akti gene ge-asocia ko u

   Kron mi grafo uti Glosa, plura tem mi este u nece - pro klari expresi -

  TE - [in order to]
e.g. ~de uti~ = "of using" alo "(to) use"
     ~te indika~ = "in order to indicate" alo "to indicate"
   Ex u-ci, mi pote dice ke mi uto tri forma de un 'no-finiti' akti-verbi:

  qi na debi ski...e plu-ci tetra elementa es :
                      religio, ge-misce filosofi e 
religio, filosofi, skience.
  religio : in id morfo puri religio es u relati inter plu 
andro e inter plu
  teo...u-ci es natura religio...andro habe kontakti ko 
plu teo, e plu teo
  auxi plu andro. Andro ne habe u Ski, solo plu teo habe 
id.
  U-la es veri frasi, u-la es u komence te habe u libe e 
u-la es kausa te resta
  in karcera. In singu andro grega na pa habe holo tem 
natura religio e u-ci 
  natura religio es veri kontakt ko hetero munda, ka in 
hetero munda existe
  u plura kausa de qod acide in u-ci kosmo. Sed kron andro 
grega pa habe boni
  konditio te eko, e mu pa habe mega imperi, so mu pa 
komence dic...qo-ka mi
  sio debi kredi ke mi ke es andro, mi es nuli-ra ante plu 
teo?
  mi pa pote akti imperi...so mi ko-co pote explika plu 
kausa de u-ci kosmo e
  mi pote dic...plu teo ne existe, mi epistemo existe.
  So kausa u-la puta...ge-misce religio pa nati...e u-la 
religio es religio
  ge-face ex andro e seqe ne habe kontakt ko nuli-ra....
  pristine kontakt  ko teo-kosmo gene frakti...pro 
plura-tem.
  Filosofi ne es sati pro andro, e tem po tem...andro akti 
ko-co skience..
  qi es neo morfo de filosofi sed ma proxi de materia bio.
  U skience habe plura kredi-pe in pluto opida, e plu 
andro kredi a kosa
  qi skience dic...u-la es veri...u-la es no-veri! Per 
skience plu andro
  kredi ke mu habe solo materia soma, ko-co ultima relati 
inter filosofi gene
  frakti, e so andro kredi ke an es solo materia soma, e 
po morta an fu morta
  simul ko se soma in fosi. U-la es fo mali koncepa...plu 
andro volu libido 
  in mu bio, mu volu habe panto-ra, ka mu puta...po u-ci 
bio mi fu es nuli-ra!
  u-la es materia teori per qi in plura planeta plura 
andro eko...
-(sko-pe) qo-pe pa face u filosofi?
-(doci-pe) ...u frasi : u andro minus plu teo ne es 
nuli-ra...gene anihila ex andro qi 
  komence dic...ab nu mi es u centra de universa..mi ne 
volu ski nuli teo
  mi solo volu cerka qo-ka mi es ci in u-ci kosmo e mi 
volu responde a plura
  qestio....minus u auxi de plu teo e teo-fe
-(sko-pe) pro exempla...!
-(doci-pe) ...pro exempla.....
                      -Ex qo-lo veni u bio epi geo?
                      -Qo-pe pa face u kosmo?
                      -Qo-di fu fini u universa?
                      -Qo-ka mi es ci, in u-ci kosmo?
                      -Qo-ka mi fu debi morta?
                      -Qo fu acide po morta?
                      -Qo-ka mi soma fu es iso pulve?
                      -Qo-ka mi habe u-ci bio,e u-la habe 
bio ma boni de u-mi?
                      -Qo es u nima de u maxi teo de 
universa?
                      -Qo es u ge-elekti demo?
                      -Qo-pe habe u 
veri?..................et cetera....
  sed na debi puta ke plu-la qestio es fo stimula...sed na 
debi puta fo boni puta
  ...qe u andro pote detekti u responde a plu-la 
qestio...qe pote u pusi andro, per se pusi
  kefa...responde a plu-la qestio?....ne, mi puta ke ne.
  Qo-pe pote responde plu-la qestio? Solo u veri kontakt 
ko urani-kosmo
  solo u veri kontakt ko urani-dimensio...in mo 
lexi...solo plu teo pote dona a na
  u responde...sed plu andro ne pa logi u-ci haplo 
koncepa....e kausa u-ci mu pa
  provoka plura mali e pa destru mu societa....kausa u-la 
mu eko in no-hedo pro holo tem.
-(sko-pe)Sed mi sio volu ski...qo-ka filosofi-pe pa cerka 
dona a plu andro-grega u explika qi
  mu ne pa pote dona?
-(doci-pe)...mi memo frase de filosofi-pe qi pa dice : 
qo-ka plu teo habe andro-morfo?
   si ko-co piski de mari sio habe plu teo, plu-la teo sio 
habe morfo de piski...u-ci koncepa
  es absoluti no-korekti.
-(sko-pe) qo-ka?
-(doci-pe) ka na debi logi ke qod na nima teo, ....efekti 
es energi de natura qi initia se ante
  plu andro in andro morfo te gene logi ex 
andro-grega...sed efekti teo es energi de natura
  qi  initia se ante andro in andro-morfo te gene logi ex 
an e te komunika info ad an...
  e u-la info es u veri ski, u veri epistemo.
-(sko-pe) si plu teo es energi....qo na es?
-(doci-pe)teo es mega energi...mega kosmo energi...e po il 
es ko-co pusi energi...na es pusi 
  energi. Psiko es energi...psiko ne es materia, materia 
gene kine ex psiko so psiko es
  energi e soma es materia , e psiko ergo in soma te sati 
se desira, plu-la desira qi
  id pote sati solo per u soma , u materia soma,e si id ne 
es ankora sati po mo bio u psiko
  itera ki intra hetero soma te dura u materia bio, e u-ci 
pote dura pro longi-tem.....
-(sko-pe) ...e plu teo e teo-fe....
-(doci-pe) plu teo e teo-fe representa singu teo alo 
teo-fe energi difere de natura, pro exempla
  teo de mari representa u energi de mari, teo de anemo 
representa energi de anemo
  teo-fe representa u no-akti dina, u matri-dina, u 
fe-dina, teo-fe de filo representa u 
  energi de filo...et cetera, kausa u-la...u dice ke solo 
mo teo existe es mega falsi.
  Plura energi existe plura teo e teo-fe existe, u eqivalu 
es facili te logi.
-(sko-pe) ...so ex vi diskusi mi pote logi ke u reinkarna 
de psiko existe....
-(doci-pe) ne solo existe, sed id es u dina de materia 
universa qi minus id ne pote eko.
  U-ci koncepa es facili te logi: si tem na bio na adora, 
pro exempla, Teo-fe, qi habe nima
  e morfo, e regi dina de natura, kron na fu morta si na 
religio akti pa es forti e boni
  ge-face, sine ki itera in neo materia soma, na ki in 
hetero psiko kosmo alo ma alti 
  dimensio in qi na fu habe neo bio, in hetero lexi na 
pote dice ko-co na fu es fo 
  proxi de na Teo-fe ke na pote dic ke na psiko e u psiko 
de na Teo-fe es ge-uni e na
  ne debi itera reinkarna. Sed u-la es resulta de 
fo-religio e de forti filo pro na Teo-fe. 
-(sko-pe)...e qo-ka u bio proxi de Teo-fe es ma boni de 
u-ci epi geo...?
-(doci-pe) ka epi geo na habe hedo e no-hedo, na pote dic 
pro singu hedo existe no-hedo qi es
  ma dina de u hedo. Na filo na ami e na es hedo si na es 
ko an, sed si na ami debi ki ab
  na komence este u manka de na ami e u-la es jam no-hedo. 
U-la acide epi geo ka 
  u-la planeta es planeta qi es in meso de kosma sistemi. 
Plura arkeo demo pa ski 
  u-ci veri, pro exempla u demo de Maja pa representa u 
kosmo per nona planeta infra
  geo e mo-tri planeta supra u geo, e seqe geo es in meso 
de u-la sistema.
  U-la es u motiva de la konditio de hedo e no-hedo qi es 
holo tem simul epi geo, e u-la 
  natura provoka plura mali kosa.
-(sko-pe) mi ne pote logi...qo-ka plu psiko itera 
reinkarna?
-(doci-pe) u-la es fo facili, solo in mo bio pe ne pote 
habe
panto-ra e plura desira resta no-sati...e so psiko cerka 
neo bio te sati mu. E te akti u-la id 
komence jam tem pa-bio....
-(sko-pe) ...tem pa-bio?
-(doci-pe) sura!kron vi pa es...pro exempla in vi pa-bio 
vi
jam pa puta a u-ci planeta e vi ko-co pa desira veni 
ci...e nu vi es ci!
-(sko-pe) sed si mi puta kosa in mi menta, u-la kosa pote 
ko-co es fantasi, e seqe ne habe 
nuli kontakt ko reali ...
-(doci-pe) u-la ne es korekti, panto-ra qi pote gene puta 
existe, e so ilusio ne existe.
u-la qi ne existe, ne solo ne existe sed ne pote gene 
puta. Vi ne pote puta idea alo kosa 
qi absoluti ne existe, qod vi puta in vi menta ko-co si in 
vi nu-bio ne existe, u-la ne volu dice
  ke absoluti ne existe. Id ne existe in u-la dimensio in 
qi vi pa puta id, sed id pote existe 
  in hetero dimensio, ka vi soma es ge-bloka a u-la 
planeta topo vi eko, sed vi menta pote 
kine ad hetero kosmo ad  hetero dimensio e per u-la cerka 
vi menta
pote detekti munda in qi fu-tem pote sati plu desira qi 
epi geo (pro exempla)ne pa 
pote sati. So kron vi pa es epi vi pa-planeta vi pa 
detekti
per vi menta u-ci kosmo, e vi ko-co pa desira veni ...vi 
forti pa desira veni ci...e po vi morta
minus problema, vi pa veni e nu vi es ci!
Qe vi vide in u-ci koncepa uno-ra xeno!
-(sko-pe) ..ne id es fo xeno, sed mi debi cepti ke u-la es

noveli  per puta-me in qi mi pa deskripti u-ci planeta e 
mi imagina es ci...e nu mi es!
-(doci-pe) vi es ka vi pa desira es ci, ka iso na pa dice 
psiko es energi e u-ci energi viagia per desira..
idio kron na psiko ne es in karcera de materia soma id 
viagia fo tako te detekti mode te

sopo..freqe vi sonia plura kosa  qi 
norma vi ne pote habe in reali, e u-la  acide ka tem sonia 
vi psiko ne es ge-liga a vi soma 
e so id viagia te sati plura kosa. Idio tem  po-morta 
psiko es fo libe...e ne pluso debi 
retroveni a soma, so id ski ke nu pote viagia ali-lo id 
volu.Plura arkeo demo pa habe 
u-ci epistemo, pro exempla qo-ka plura demo  pa akti 
pirami iso religio-do.....
-(sko-pe) mi ne ski...efekti id es fo stimula!
-(doci-pe) Egipti exempla e Maja in bi area fo tele alelo 
pa akti pene homo struktura pro religio motiva.
Na ski ke arkeo-tem pa existe mega kontinenta inter Europa 
e Amerika di qi nima pa es 
Atlantis, e po u-la kontinenta pa dispare...u-la es mega 
misteri de histori, sed na debi dic 
ke u-la efekti pa acide retro plura anua. Plu-la demo  pa

existe u-la kontinenta, e posi mu pa habe mega teknologi 
ski. Sed plu-la kultura pa fini
  e u fini de plu-la kultura es pro u skience-pe de geo fo 
misteria. 
-(sko-pe) mi ne pote kredi ke na pote es qod vi dic...
-(doci-pe) qe tu es tu plu vesti?...nu-di tu habe plu-la

tu vesti e tu ne es plu vesti qi tu habe epi tu soma....
-(sko-pe) u-la es veri...
-(doci-pe) qe tu es tu soma?...tem u-ci bio tu habe u-la 
soma, sed tem tu fu-bio tu fu habe hetero 
soma...so tu ne es tu soma.....qe tu es tu plu desira? 
plura desira gene sati e ne pluso 
existe sed neo plu desira veni te gene sati...so tu ne es 
tu plu desira....so qo tu efekti es?
imagina ke tu ne es ni tu vesti, ni tu soma, ni tu 
desira....qo tu pote es?
-(sko-pe) mi pote akti u-la...mi volu filo, mi volu u kali 
mi volu eko...eko,filo,kali....
-(doci-pe) tu boni pa dice...tri valu : eko, filo, kali
qo es eko: eko volu dice:mi volu eko, mi volu habe bio, e 
in u-ci bio mi volu gene filo 
alo mi sio volu filo uno-pe, mi volu audi alo vide u kali, 
e qo es u kali? kali flori es kali
u kali de natura, u kali de harmoni muzika, u kali de 
aglao onto....u kali u bio u filo....
e qe u sexu ne es morfo te expresi u filo ,
plura societa puta ke u sexu es no-boni alo no-puri kosa, 
sed si na reflekti na pote logi ke
  u sexu in ali morfo id es ge-expresi es filo-ru. So, mi 
desira sexu, mi habe in mi plura 
sexu desira qi mi ne pote sati...u societa skema freqe ne 
lase u libe te expresi u veri sexu 
desira e na debi es hipokriti...ko-co si inter na e na

so mi resta ci-mode ka si mi sio volu kambio u-la sio es

in na psiko plura no-ge-expresi desira qi atende u morta e 
u neo bio te veni ex de na psiko,
  qi longi-tem pa tena mu.
-(sko-pe) so soma volu dice : idea plus libido plus

Deo! You guys are so geeky and weird (and I thought I was)! I subscribe to 
the glosa list, ido, folkspraak and english spelling reform lists to 
engage in interesting discussion and the furtherance of ideas to do with 
spoken and written tongues, why do you clutter up my post box with 
personal attacks and squabbles with each other!? can you not control your 
angers better than a 15 year old (me)? glosa is hardly heading for success 
as it is, without people like you two and these kind of weirdnessess put 
me off linguistics a lot! I don't know which of you is in the wrong here, 
but why anyone would go to linguistics groups to send viruses to people i 
don't know. i am sorry for the use of slang terms that some may find 
offensive in this email, but i feel they sum up the situation more 
accurately than perhaps other words would do. after all, what is language 
but slang for gestures?

41. e kron plu mali more prevale, plu gina de famili gene

42. U-la duce u famili e plu membra de famili ad hades, ka 
plu spiritu de plu 
43  pre-parenta ne pluso cepti plu ceremoni ofere de oriza 
e de aqa

44. U demo qi pa destru plu famili traditio fu eko in 
hades pro longi-tem.

45. Na es prepara te akti mega peka, in cide na plu 
parenta qi gene cecilo ex
       lafigmo.

46. Id sio es fo boni pro mi ke plu fili de Dhritarashtra

        iso-tem ke mi es minus arma.

47. Sanjaja pa dic: po u dice de plu-la lexi Arjuna bali

*  Hello Sid and all,
   I really wanted to reply to this message ... until I started trying to
get into it.
   Well, I persevered, and know that Sid doesn't like plumbers because they
have palatial houses, charge an excessive amount for their services, often
make a bigger mess than there was before they started, are very scarce, and
the poor householder has no recourse, in law, at least not in the UK.
   But if I was asked to draw a map of the leaky covered pipes in Sid's
flat .. even if my life depended on it .. I would have to pass.

   So, Sid's been at Glosa longer than I have, but the fact that he does
not write user-friendly Glosa, is part of the case against Glosa.

   Well, we don't have a full-scale dictionary , and "plumber" is not
listed, so Sid had to derive a word as best he could: ~domi-aqua ergo-pe~
it aint.  Well, by now, there should have been a set of easily followable
guidelines, for the derivation of neologisms, but there is not.
   So we are left on our wits and with the small Latin dictionary, which,
incidentally, has no listing for plumber.
   However, we know that lead drains were found in Pompeii, so there must
have been lead-workers in ancient Rome.  PLUMBA = lead (Pb).
   So, were Sid provided with derivation guidelines, his plumber might have
come out looking more like ~plumba-ergo-pe~.

*  I would like a more descriptive use of the language, but Sid's use of
Glosa is within the Open Plan that Ron left us.
   While there are no rules of syntax - published by any authoritative
Glosa Language Committee - and while there is no system of accreditation -
with instruction, correction of assignments, and qualifying examination -
then Sid's usage is as good as the next man's.
   The fact that it makes my head spin trying to make sense of it, cannot
be a criticism of Sid, but of a language that can't decide on a set of
rules for its grammar, and which leaves its usage open to the language
sense of its practitioners.

   Though I wonder which is more important: to get the vocabulary

sorry robin. your reply hits the nail on the head - as there is no grammar in 
glosa or what there is can be about as illogical as most natural languages, 
my construction is as good as anyone elses' - but you cannot understand it so 
there is something downright bad here - could be me could be glosa .......   
I keep pointing out the problem and offering suggestions . - I find the same 
with other people's glosa - I did a course on the structure of english some 
years ago and got marks in the 70s so I should be able to master the 
structure of glosa with little trouble, I think, if there was one. as far as 
I can see the method is to find the glosa equivalent of each  english  word, 
put it down in english sentence order but without the grammar markers - not 
at all satisfactory.
shall work on it with my next stuff on universe and creators thereof - hope 
nobody is  upset by the contents

The book "Central Glosa", p. 107, suggests "tubi-pe".  So we have
tubi-pe also in the Glosa Internet Dictionary,
http://www.glosa.org/gid/engl.htm .

As far as I know, tubes made of lead are not technical standard any
more.  Tosto plu tubi-pe fu veni e frakti plu mura de na lava-ka te

Actually, every language is a slave to the whims of its users.
The people demand all kinds of contradictory things simultaneously,
which explains the illogic of language, not to mention politics.
If only English-users try Glosa, naturally they import their idioms,
and then it fails as an inter-language for the majority of Europeans;
the goal was to make a simple Lingua Franca for the modern world.

Words like "tubi-pe" are not going to fly, obviously, so the question
is whether to move on to the next step in Glosa's evolution, or just
abandon it altogether. I think there are enough good features in
Hogben's version 1 (Interglossa) and today's version 2 (Glosa) to
suggest that a version 3 would be well worth pursuing. However,
a schism (Ido/Esperanto, Occidental/Interlingua) would be ruinous.

The question is therefore:
Is Glosa good enough for communicating in?
I would think it is, I've seen is used as such
on this list. It is easy enough to use after some
period of casual study. I wouldn't say that 
Glosa is a schism of Interglossa, nobody
that I know of uses Interglossa, it's dead like
ancient Latin, as an example I wouldn't say
that Spanish is a schism of Latin... Glosa is
alive because it's in use, keep using it and it
remains alive and working, stop using it and
it dies. If there's differing opinions on how to
use Glosa or express things logically in it, well,
there's always the option of going to the 
copyright holder, something not available for
classical Latin, unless we had a spare Roman
in refrigeration that could answer our questions
on usage, but Wendy is still around, thank God
for this and we can always fall back on what 
she feels her language should be like... It's like
Paul Simon's phrase that says:
"Disagreements? Work 'em out."

On whether Interlingua is a schism of Occi,
well I would resoundly say "no". But on this
matter we're going to clash I'm afraid and 
perhaps there's the old song by Dave Mason:
"There ain't no good guys,
There ain't no bad guys,
There's only you and me,
And we just disagree."


Since,
Jay B.

a bit scrappy this lot, sorry but
dear robin and all

the plumber was tall [and with broad shoulders.]

we have SVO [O for our purposes]. the key phrase is V as it shows where S and 
O are - it is 'was'. 'was' tells us also the time relation between the 
sentence's time and that of the writing of the sentence - past tense, the 
action/state takes place before the writing. so 'was' is a 
time-relation-phrase [tem-relatio-verba-grega/grupo]. I prefer this 
definition as 'doing-word' and 'akti-verba' are not very apt - nothing is 
being done here. 'was' also tells us the tense and number - economic and 
informative - good for English.
Glosa [from 'Central Glosa'] gives us 'es' for 'to be' and 'pa' for the past 
tense. = 'pa es'
next the object phrase = "alti"
an pa es alti
if we look back in central glosa for 'alti', we get 'high/tall'
the plumber is tall - a long way between his feet and his head, or
the plumber is high - a long way between his feet and the ground - perhaps on 
a ladder.
change of plan:-
the plumber HAD tallness/height 
I think that could work ok
an pa habe alti.

A plumber was a lead[Pb] worker - u plumba-ergo-pe - he is called a plumber 
because he would have used lead 2000 years ago - on the same lines and much 
earlier, a tailor should now be called a boner and flinter!

he was a person, he was working for us - a work-person, he was working on a 
system - a sytem-work-person, it was a water system - a 
water-system-work-person, it was house water - a 
house-water-system-work-person.
each part of the construction helps/modifies/clarifies the following one till 
the final part is the head of the phrase.
glosa has accepted this construction:-
there is one person and start with 'u'. this word introduces our subject 
phrase and at the same time indicates number, it is a numbered phrase/noun 
phrase
u domi-aqa-sistema-ergo-pe
long winded but my dictionary here, central glosa, allows me only about 1000 
words. a dictionary that had Eng-plumber to glosa in it would be much much 
longer.

and he had broad shoulders
'he' is a numbered phrase/NP and is the S.it is a complete phrase and does 
not need "u"
'had' as before
'habe' can be, in G, a V to have/own/posess, a N ownership/posessions, an 
adjective owned, an adverb?
his ownership broadened his shoulders
owner-like, broadly shouldered .....
make it 'the broad shoulders', and it is clear
so
e an pa habe plu lati skapa

I should like to see how other people tackle the sentence and their analyses 
.......

Sorry Sid and all,
I had written a fantastic reply, then mis-saved it somehow.
   From memory, I went on about the PA being possibly misplaced: it relates
to meeting the plumber not to the existence, or otherwise, of the plumber.
   Also I mentioned that the second PA - relating to his width, could be
elided.
   There was reference to the need for a level of conscious thought about
what one is going to say - in Glosa, because the words are used as abstracts.
   Sid wanted to point out that ~habe~, by rights, according to Glosa lore,
should just as easily be used as N, Adj and Adv as it is as a V.  I thought
that was pusing it a bit, but agreed there might be non-verb "havingnesses"
where ~habe~ was the right word.
   I pointed out that ~pa es~ was just as easily "did be" as it was "was,"
and that this inflected usage in English clouded the semantics.
   I ended up with 
     ~Mi pa enkontro un alti domi-aqa-sistema-ergo-pe; qi habe plu lati
skapa.~
               Here the PA is firmly with the event, and not with the
person, whom we believe to be still alive.
   In the earlier, obliminated version, I offered Sid a free copy of GLOSA
6000 if he sends his land address.  I actually refer to a print-out of the
ENG->GLO G.I.D. which is more complete than "6000."
   Sid, mate, the offer is still open.
   I did add that for people, being what they are, shorter compounds are
much better than more complete, and more correct, longer ones.  I came out
in favour of 
    ~u plumba-ergo-pe~  over  ~domi-aqa-sistema-ergo-pe~  AND
    ~meso-ra~  if  ~akti-verbi~  won't do, over
                                     ~tem-relatio-verba-grega/grupo~

   People, as I said, being people, will dispense with what they find
cumbersome and unnecessary, and will abbreviate.       
   The  ~meso-ra~ [middle bit]  comes between Subject and Object.

Syd discusses:

> I should like to see how other people tackle the sentence and their analyses

A long time ago (when trolls were underground) we discussed the ways
different languages have different ideas about what an "adjective"
really is, and about which "parts-of-speech" are really useful;
grammar as taught in most schools is especially confusing about this.
Anyway we must identify in your example sentence that WAS is not
even a real verb, it's just an auxiliary; and TALL is a predicate
adjective, modifying the subject PLUMBER; there is no object,
it is just a subject-predicate kinda thing. Glosa has just two
distinct word-classes, the particles (including BE, HAVE, etc)
and the full words (PLUMBER, HEIGHT, etc).

Most languages do not treat attributive adjectives like English.
We've elevated them to equal status with nouns and verbs, whereas
others usually treat them more like plain nouns or verbs. We must
say "the tall one" where they would say "the tall" or "it talls".
And if a Spanish speaker hears "a man tall" or "a tall man" it is
no obstacle to understanding, but we would get all upset about it.
This is not a problem in those interlanguages that permit either
noun-adjective or adj-noun word order within the noun phrase;
both are statistically equally common among world languages,
and so it seems to me that both should be permitted in Glosa.

I want to avoid the vocabulary question for now, so will just
say "plomero" without further explanation. A definite article
is also needed, so I'll pick "le" for the nonce. For the
concept of height, I guess it has to be something like "alta".
Then we'd get approximately: "Le plomero habe alta", avoiding
the English "predicate adjective" construction. Adding the
shoulders is then straightforward ... Of course "un alta plomero"
or "un plomero alta" could mean several different things, but
that's just the way adjectives work in the real world.

Mi pa lekto tu grama e me gratia tu de id.
Mi efekti analizi u struktura de plura lingua e mi pa face

id es mi pasio, ab mi pedio-tem, e mi pote dice ke in mi
bio mi pa gene sko de plu lingua e ko-co nu-di ke mi habe
40 anua, pasio existe ko-co e mi es fo hedo analizi e gene

inter Glosa e plu hetero ge-face lingua existe 
difere....mega
difere. Mi pa komence u stude de ge-face lingua per 
Esperanto
kron mi pa habe 15 anua, e u-la lingua pa dona ad me fo 
excita, pro u motiva...."Qe veri ke panto-pe in u-ci munda 
fu pote expresi per u-ci simpli lingua? Id sio es

e efekti id es fantasi, esperanto ne solo habe desfacili

, mi pro exempla pa tenta doci id ad mi fe-sponsa minus

Po, mi pa logi....posi mi ne habe problema pro uti u-ci

mi pa dic, qo-ka mi jam ski u latini lingua, in qi il es 
pluri kaso
sed pro mi fe-sponsa, qi ne habe klasika kultura id es ne

Mi pa komence logi ke u solve de internatio lingua ne sio

na habe
ne solo akuzativo sed ko-co genitivo, e dativo. U-la volu 
dice
ke si simpli akuzativo pote es desfacili pro homi qi ne

Thanks to Carmelo for his translation of Bhagavad Gita, chapter one.
I have put it on http://www.glosa.org/gl/bagavadg.htm .  There are
also some Bahá'i and Bible texts on www.glosa.org .  And I think, that
is good:  People can see, that Glosa is valid to express their
feelings, opinions and beliefs, as fas as we try to offer a wealthy
and balanced mixture of Glosa texts.  If one does not like the meaning
of a text, he can easily click to another -- on a website.  But on a
mailing list it is different.

So please do not misuse Glosalist, a linguistic discussion forum, for
making propaganda for one particular religion.  Please do not attack
other religions and do not offend their believers.

Plu ma boni idea:  Face idio www-pagina ko religio tema.  Grafo e dice
direkti a plu pe; qi habe interese de id.  E maxi efekti: preka a tu
teo; tende an duce plu pe ad u korekti religio.  Mi fu akti so, plus.
Si na preka fu gene audi; mo kron na panto fu unio in u-ci korekti
religio homo plu sibi in paci.  Saluta ex Marcel.

Sorry, I confess, that I did not understand, what kind of event you
were describing.  Was it a lecture about Hinduism?

Saluta - Marcel.

*  Mi Plu Karo Amika,
   I write in English to be quick; I should work harder to do it in Glosa.
   I think that you have misunderstood Charles' intention.
   As I remember the discussion with Charles on the idea of 'perfecting'
Glosa by revising it to a much better version - probably with a different
name - refers to a language to which he has given the working title of,
"Glosa 3."
   So, I interpret Charles' comments, about a possible schism, as being a
schism between Glosa 2 (normal Clark/Ashby Glosa) and Glosa 3 (an ammended
Glosa derivative, as yet to be specified or formed).
   I think this is what Charles implied.
   I am almost certain that he was not suggesting anyone hark back to Glosa
1 (Hogben's Interglossa), and nor was he seeing Glosa 2 (C/A Glosa) as the
improved breakaway.

   This whole Glosa 1 - 3 nomenclature worries me, because to project Glosa
(1992 Version) backwards to dub Interglossa (Hogben, 1943) as _Glosa 1_ is
historical nonsense.  A number of members of Conlang persisted in calling
Glosa "Glossa".  And for people who are pedantic on spellings, I found such
behaviour perverse.
   If anyone must talk about an as yet unformed derivative of current
Glosa, I would suggest that they gave it, the concept, a specific name such
as "N-M Glosa", for 'New Millenium Glosa.'

   And for sure, if a new criterion set was prepared for a language that
was radically better than, or rather different from, current Glosa, which I
might call "Glosa (1992 Ver.)", then such an initiative from within what
might loosely be called the Glosa Movement, would definitely cause a split
in its ranks.
   As it so happens, If I sat down and thought hard, I might come up with a
slightly varied criterion list for Glosa, But I would not push such
possible changes as an agenda: instead, I would use some of the new ideas
in my Glosa writing, in the thought that if they had value, they might
catch on.




>   it's dead like
>ancient Latin, as an example I wouldn't say
>that Spanish is a schism of Latin... Glosa is
>alive because it's in use, keep using it and it
>remains alive and working, stop using it and
>it dies.
*  One of my worries is this keeping Glosa alive by using it.
   I, for one, am not doing enough of it.
   Sid is definitely doing his bit.  Though he and I might differ on points
of usage, our differences are more like differences over English language
usage, than the cause of splitting Glosa into two versions.
   But many more of the Glosa Group should be writing using it.
   Wendy should be receiving an overflow mail of potential items for Plu
Glosa Nota.  We can use the vocabulary as it is: changing spellings is
purely a matter of editing.  The thingwhich takes much more effort is to
get our syntax right.  and even before the lexicon is set inconcrete, we
can start practising word order and Glosa 
constructions.
   Only when we have a reasonably consistent usage of Glosa can we say the
language lives.  I have been caught up, lately, in trying to do something
about the present Australian drought - the country is drier than at any
time since weather records began.
   --> I should compile my lexicon of Glosa words that are drought related,
possibly adding a few neologisms in the process, and then should tell the
yarn in Glosa for PGN readers.

   What stories do other Glosa-pe have running through your heads, at
present: tell the stories in Glosa .. enrich the language by "testing" it
in areas where it may not have been used before.

>   If there's differing opinions on how to
>use Glosa or express things logically in it, well,
>there's always the option of going to the 
>copyright holder, something not available for
>classical Latin, unless we had a spare Roman
>in refrigeration that could answer our questions
>on usage, but Wendy is still around, thank God
>for this and we can always fall back on what 
>she feels her language should be like... 
*  As I was saying, it is a matter of submitting our Glosa usage to Wendy -
preferably in PGN usable articles - rather than our waiting for her to keep
producing example of good Glosa.  Without feeback, we will never know ifwe
are using the language acceptably, or not.
   And, for me, acceptable usage has occurred when most Glosa-pe understand
the writer's intention, and can say they know what he means.

   So, that means Glosa is a language of empathy: people should have a
mental picture of the listener/reader in front of them, when they speak 

It's like
>Paul Simon's phrase that says:
>"Disagreements? Work 'em out."
>
>On whether Interlingua is a schism of Occi,
>well I would resoundly say "no". But on this
>matter we're going to clash I'm afraid and

Mi Karo Robin,
Well, it sure is good to hear back
from you!
As I said in my previous post,
I think that we don't need an
new-Glosa, the old Glosa
may need tweaking and working out
but so does English on a daily basis.
Through use... nonne?

The problem with Glosa is that
one may not feel up to getting
up and running with it because
as I understand it the language
is the property of Wendy. This
is fine and whatever Wendy wants
with her language should be
respected. If anyone wants to
come up with changes to the
language they should call it
something entirely different,
and come up with some
different criteria for its
construction. As to my
misunderstanding Charles,
well, what can I say, I stopped
trying, someone with as filthy
a mouth as he I'm not willing
to deal with any longer, as the
saying goes oppose the devil
and he will flee from you...
:-)))
Since,
Jay B.

P.S. I hope your efforts in
dealing with the drought are
successful, as always, Robin,
w/ all my best wishes for you!

Subject: [glosalist] How Many Glosas?
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 7 Nov 2002 09:58:51 EST

Dear Colleagues,

I am a new Glosa user, and I am not a linguist or language builder - I have 
far too much trouble writing well in English to consider myself other than an 
imperfect  language user.  As a result, I think I have a different 
perspective on Glosa from some of the discussion on the list.  

For me it does not matter whether Glosa is perfect or fine tuned if no one 
uses it.  We have some discussion on this list in Glosa, we have a newsletter 
from time to time, and not much more.  If I wrote a book in Glosa (or if any 
other member of this list did so), who would buy and read it?  Glosa poorly 
constructed but used is far more relevant than Glosa perfectly constructed 
and unused.  

If I am going to go to the trouble of learning and using a language I want it 
to be stable.  The rules of French grammar or Spanish grammar do not change 
every month - but if Glosa had followed all of the excursions I have seen on 
this list, our change rate would be at least once a month.  If I learn Glosa, 
or Glosa 2, or whatever it is we are using, and the handful of people on the 
list decide that they want to use Glosa 3, or New Millennium, or whatever, 
then we all either have to relearn or we have to accept that we are becoming 
the ever more perfect members of an ever decreasing herd.  That is perhaps a 
fine thing if the objective is perfection of a hobby - it is a horrible thing 
if the intent is to communicate with a larger and larger sphere of people.

Constant change is even more difficult if we intend to ever publish a body of 
literature in Glosa, in my mind an absolute requirement for growth in the 
number of users.  I asked this question earlier, and someone noted that they 
could read something that had been written in Glosa years before.  That is 
the cost of the language being stable - and whether or not you like Wendy 
"owning" the language, that is the very great benefit of it.  If Glosa is 
going to change routinely there is no reason for me, or any other author, to 
write in it - half of the purpose of publishing books and articles is to 
ensure the continuity of knowledge.  If 10 years from now people cannot read 
what I have written because Glosa is Glosa 17, we will have missed the point. 
  

I think debate about the future evolution of Glosa is a good thing.  I think 
arguing about how best to express grammatical forms is wonderful.  But I 
wonder why I do not see debate about how best to structure courses in basic 
Glosa, what the content for an equivalent to the 10 lesson Esperanto course 
should be and how to recruit tutors to deliver it, about how to develop and 
encourage more publications in Glosa, about how to recognize Glosa 
proficiency - in short about how to grow the community of users so that we 
will have enough people to make all the inward looking arguments worthwhile 
and significant?

I have proposed a Glosa introductory course for my University's Continuing 
Professional Development and Personnel Enrichment Program (our continuing 
education unit community outreach program).  We may even look at doing it 
online.  So who has a good idea about what I should teach and how to get 
students into the program?

And has anyone ever wondered why we use an emblem that is a marketing and 
logo design nightmare to sell our language?  At least the Esperantists have a 
simple green star ... and an easily recognizable flag ...

From: Tom Croft <tom{at}code-demon.net>
Date: Fri, 8 Nov 2002 02:01:12 +0000

I'm very new to glosa---I like what (little) I know of the langauge,
but a few things occurred to me (unstructured babble commences):

If the goal is to skim internationality from common languages,
surely `helo' is a better greeting than `ave'..?  Ave gets the piss
taken out of it in Asterix IIRC (which I do, a small point, I know)

Artificial language `lojban' dispenses with uppercase letters (a
most elegant move!), and while glosa is targetted at europeans I
presume (who are already aquainted with uppercase and such), that
would be a good change to the language in my humble, uneducated,
opinion.

I agree that major changes are probably undesirable; if any are to be
made, they must be made before the tutorials are written ;-).  Language
does of course change (Marlowe can be great, but he's fucking
impossible to read in any original form without translating
constantly), but yes, I agree the literature of last decade must
remain comprehensible!

The glosa symbol I also thought ridiculous.  How about a red triangle?
It's easy, and it can be asciified thusly: [/\]

The main things that repelled me from esperanto:

1: There were suffixes for: male, unspecified-gender and female.  The
   default form of words was probably male but I was unsure about what
   constituted best practice.
2: There was no list of absolute minimum vocabulary, such as glosa
   mil.  The closest I could find was a vocab list for GCSE
   (high-school-level (16 y/o) exams in Britain).

The main things that attracted me to glosa:

1: A pair of dictionaries in a well-described text-based format so I
   could hack together a basic word-lookup tool.  My esperanto equivalent
   is *much* cruder.
2: It's a piece of piss to read with a dictionary programme; I learnt
   the basics from a big list of translated sentences about `she is going
   to town' etc.  This was much easier than the intellectual effort
   required to read a tutorial.

On a more negative note, I was put off considerably by the connection
to latin.  That word evokes fear in people!  I would suggest replacing
it with "common european word roots" wherever possible!

I never used the esperanto interactive tutorials (OK, so I did, but
not the interactive element); I would welcome friendly glosa intro
material, of course, but for my own learning, I'd rather have my
dictionary-grepper and a translated fairy-tale (If anyone wants to
write/translate fairy tales or similar literature, I'd love it!).

paci, Tom

agree about the capitals and wrote as much some time ago - i tend to leave 
them out in glosa, some europeanophiles are not happy but hindi for instance 
does without them happily. i am working on the assumption that the glosa rule 
is no caps but they can be used if required and in any way that people  want
i did toy with making a sort of tutorial whereby there was a story and each 
sentence's grammar, vocab etc was explained. however the attitude to grammar 
was rather confused
at the moment i am putting forward an atheist point of view to balance things 
up and will look at the non-religeous  sides of for instance Christ which i 
find exteremely sensible also the hindu chapter
i might use it to introduce glosa

   BTW, Walter from which culture/language_base do you come; you are doing
a lot better with English than many of those who have had the benefit of it
throughout their entire education.

of items written in Glosa; and I am pleased to see, of late, that Marcel
has been able to add a Glosa version of St Mark's gospel and a
Glosa_original Science Fiction story to his website!
   This is, I'd say, the cutting edge of Glosa.
   I have invited people to write more children's stories in Glosa, but
have had no takers yet; I will have to dust off the children's stories and
start adding titles, myself.  Needless to say, I ought to update (edit) the
original three on my website.

BUT, many would, without any prior training in Glosa, be able to get the
general understanding of it from their knowlege of the Classical languages,
and from the consistency of the ^plain vanilla^ syntax within the writing.
    [I have invented  ^ ..... ^  to indicate metaphoric or idiomatic usage:
the general term to describe such usage is 'non-literal language'; all
languages use this sort of thing, and there should be a mechanism whereby
it can be used in Glosa, also.]

felt it necessary to visit Paris at least every six months, to keep his
usage current, and to ensure that what he was teaching was up to date;
Glosa - in its usage and vocabulary - was basicaly "set" in 1992, with the
publication of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.

   The piece I wrote in respose to the mention of numbers .. and my
invention of the distinguishing name 'New Millenium Glosa' .. was to
criticise such a trend towards schism, and to introduce the analogy of
computer games, which are always coming out with new versions - something
to be avoided in a Planned Language.

>Constant change is even more difficult if we intend to ever publish a body
of literature in Glosa, in my mind an absolute requirement for growth in
the number of users. 
*  The phrase "set in cement" keeps cropping up in my mind, and I keep
trying to suppress it.
   However, 'linguistic drift' does occur in all languages, and Glosa will
be no different; but, a language proposed to standardise global
intercommunication will need - after its worldwide adoption - some form of
regulatory control.  In a similar way to the method the French use - having
an official body that rules on usage - Glosa, if it is installed as the
International Auxilliary Language, will also need some degree of regulation.

>    I asked this question earlier, and someone noted that they 
>could read something that had been written in Glosa years before.  
*  This is basically true - othewise I could not get away with leaving the
children's stories, written in the early nineties, on my website.
   The basic criteria for Glosa have not changed from its inception, though
there has been some tweaking, such as the addition of a mechanism for using
"Passive Voice".  
   Ron Clark's dictum, "a word is modified by its precedent," is still
true, but the trick is in the interpretation of this 'rule'; and, the
'syntax-based grammar' under which Glosa operates, is derived from this
original dictum.

authoritative rulings on the usage and forward direction of Glosa, I would
probaly feel a little less unasy: her status in the Glosa heirarchy is
reminiscent of that of the Queen in Australia's.  The Queen is titular head
(and owner) of Australia, but plays no part in the running of the place.
   If Wendy was answering your comments, now, she would be seen to be
exerting the rights of an "owner."  The fact that she is not on the Net,
and that life, in general, makes it difficult for her to participate in the
day-to-day running of Glosa, suggests the need for something like an
Esperanto-style "academy" to watch over the development of the language.

ensure the continuity of knowledge.  If 10 years from now people cannot
read what I have written because Glosa is Glosa 17, we will have missed the
point. 
>
*  When I fist met Ron Clark in 1977, the "Glossa" effort was definitely on
the "R" of its R&D; now we are much more into the "D" end of Glosa's R&D
spectrum, but not ^out of the woods^ of Research and Development altogether.
   Some see the need for a rock-solid lexicon as the necessary foundation
stone for the language.  I believe that Glosa-pe should be advancing on all
fronts; and, using the language within various genres is definitely part of
this "Development" phase - or, as we now say, 'Beta-testing.'  Does it work
effectively to convey all manner of information?  I "tested" Glosa, in the
early stages, on children's stories, to check out Glosa's effectiveness in
the 'affective' area: could I get across the feeling behind Cinderella's
mother's admonition that her daughter NOT venture into the woods; could I
convey the bears' desolation when their little visitor fled from them; how
heartbroken was Little Bear when he found his chair broken?
   So, is Glosa still a 'work in progress'?
   To some extent, I fear so.
   But, what is written in Glosa, to-day, will be quite clearly understood
by Glosa speakers of twenty years hence - though considered  a little
quaint, I suspect.
   
>I think debate about the future evolution of Glosa is a good thing.  I
think arguing about how best to express grammatical forms is wonderful.
But I wonder why I do not see debate about how best to structure courses in
basic Glosa, what the content for an equivalent to the 10 lesson Esperanto
course should be and how to recruit tutors to deliver it, about how to
develop and encourage more publications in Glosa, about how to recognize
Glosa proficiency - in short about how to grow the community of users so
that we will have enough people to make all the inward looking arguments
worthwhile and significant?
>
*  These questions definitely ^hit the nail on the head^ ... or on the thumb.
   The suggestion is that training and accreditation methods be developed;
the criticism is that they are not.
   We could do a lot worse than go through the historical _Step by Step in
Esperanto_ by Montagu C. Butler, and produce a Glosa version of it.  Such a
product would look something like a half-century later's update of Hogben's
_Interglossa_.
   Now that we are solidly into the electronic phase of our civilisation's
development, I feel that something that could come out with colour
illustrations, possibly with some "Flash" animations - and with the
benefits of hypertext links - might be made available on CD.
   This is not to say that hardcopy versions of Glosa instruction,
preferably in colour, but even some in stark B&W, would not do the job.
[BTW I have never used a double negative in Glosa; I wonder if it works?]
[[I saw a COLOUR lazer printer advertised in a computer magazine,
yesterday; I did not look at the price - but I could.]]
   While Ron Clark's _18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa_ is GEO copyrighted, and
is of extreme historical significance, it is far from the last word in
pedogological science.  With suitable will, we can do a lot better; and,
with a training plan, we could do even better, still.

>I have proposed a Glosa introductory course for my University's Continuing
Professional Development and Personnel Enrichment Program (our continuing
education unit community outreach program).  We may even look at doing it
online.  So who has a good idea about what I should teach and how to get
students into the program?
>
*  There are almost too many good questions, here; but, Walter, you are to
be congratulated for asking them all.
   Every good language course has a curriculum: I even suspect that
Esperanto has one.  By looking at the list of educational objectives in
such a curriculum, you should find a suitable list of Glosa learning
outcomes.  
   Would all members of the List please hunt through their archives, or
consult their local education authorities, so we can pool our information
on the Glosalist - and thus derive a suitable Glosa curriculum for Walter.

   In terms of the gearing of a 'continuing education' course in Glosa, I
am not sure who the advertising should be aimed at.  We cannot say that
Glosa is the successor to Esperanto: this is not currently a fact.  Printed
(or computer referenced) information on a "Learning Vocabulary", Glosa's
Rules of Grammar, and sectional vocabularies would probably be the place to
start.  But also, models of well-formed Glosa sentences, with explanatory
information, plus easy-reading examples of Glosa prose, would also be very
worthwhile.
   But this all begs the question of Course design.
   I'd go for action, and possibly excitement, every time.  We need to stir
the verbs - and stir the blood, in the same process.
   While 'the cat sitting on the mat' is passe, and somewhat boring, >cats
being chased by yelping dogs< gets some movement into the verbs, and allows
for delicious adjectives that get the emotions going.
   While most courses start with the somewhat passive tourist ogling
railway stations, busses and places of interest, I feel that Glosa-pe and
'citicens of the World' want a bit more action.  Perhaps a traffic scene,
with near misses, bustling pedestrians and shouting cops, would get
learners straight into 'thinking in Glosa' rather than treating the
learning of Glosa as a translation exercise.
   However, that being said, a study of the demographics of those wising to
take on 'further education' might turn up a wide range of motivations.
Some would respond to the challenge of learning a different language,
others might appreciate the possibility of acquiring the future global
second language, and some could see the connection between a language with
syntax-based grammar and the demands of computer Meta-languages.  There are
a number of good reasons for learning Glosa, not the least of which is that
most Glosa-pe are altruists.  However, I would add that the Internet, as a
global means of communication is, as yet, incomplete: the wires are twisted
together; the carrier software is installed; but the 'pinkware' through
which minds inter-communicate is still absent, and the "language problem"
has only been expressed at a higher level.
   So, what is the missing link in Global communication?  The language that
all can use and understand .. easily!
   To me the prime question is: why is a sentence?
   The answer for me is that we relate to one another by telling stories,
and the smallest components of these stories are sentences.
   Thus each sentence is a small story, with actors, victims and actions,
or Actor-Action-Victim .. and usually told in that order (S-V-O).  So, I'd
imagine an instructional schema that helped people build up sentences,
starting with small, uncomplicated ones, and building via the
sophistication of more complex phrases, up to the use of fully formed
clauses within sentences.  This pedogological aim would, of course, be
interwoven with the cultural, thematic material.  Hence the idea of
starting with an aspect of life that is almost automatic, and capable of
being dealt with in short sentences, like walking in traffic.  Actual
shopping, for example, requires a higher level of language, with
interaction between the buyer and the shop-keeper - hence it would come
later in the course.
   Because Glosa does not represent an existing culture, we can not assume
that people will automatically start thinking in Glosa; and, because Glosa
does not concretely see words as distinct parts of speech, nor does it have
the facilitation of "inflections", the learner is left to juggle the raw
concepts as ideational words.  This is an acquirable trick, but it can also
be a bit of a shock to people brought up in the learning-by-hearing
tradition.  Here I have to mention creativity: the more imagination a
person has, then the faster they will catch onto Glosa's founding formula.

   Of course, we don't tell people this is also the problem with English,
and the minimal degree of inflection (~5) allows people to think of English
as a normal sort of European language.  But it is not: English is a
'bastard' language comprising two different grammatical systems, one of
which is 'syntax-based.'
   So, Glosa does what English has been tending to do - dropping out the
inflections - but carries this trend on to its logical conclusion.
     EG  the English cricket team  -->  the England cricket team

>And has anyone ever wondered why we use an emblem that is a marketing and
logo design nightmare to sell our language?  At least the Esperantists have
a simple green star ... and an easily recognizable flag ...
>
*  Good question.  I didn't wonder: I knew.  Ron Clark chose the Greek
letter "Psi" to symbolise the idea behind Glosa.  He doubled the circular
bit to say there is an inner and an outer level of Glosa usage.  The outer
represents the more pedestrian use of language, while the inner circle
represents more rigorous usage - within science, law and business.

           /           \
          |  /       \  |
          |  |   |   |  |
           \  \__|__/  /
            \____|____/ 
                 |
                 |
                 |

   Agreed, it doesn not translate readily into the popular culture, nor
onto flag or in email.  So, an extra - more popularly recognisable - symbol
might be needed.

   With apologies about the length of this post, I look forward to working
with the group that supports Walter in his aims.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

   But with a topic on which there are so many understandings of truth, I

   In short, I cannot pin down the concepts to a KAUR, if I have not been
able to locate the KAUR concept we are dealing with - using my own personal

   Would you please give me a translation of ~kosmo-alo-uno-ra~ into Sunday

*    Hello Sid and All,
     While Sid sees capitals, and, I suspect, fullstops, as optional extras
in Glosa, I do not.
     Firstly, hindi users of Glosa - I have not met any yet - might choose
to optionally avoid the use of capital letters and most punctuation, but
the downside of this could be that many Glosa-pe will not attempt to read
what they have written.
     Secondly, with a syntax-based grammar system, I feel that Glosa needs
all the legitimate help it can get.  In fact, it is my considered belief
that punctuation is a part of Glosa grammar, acting as sign-posts to the
start and finish of the various elements of sentences.
     Thirdly, Capitals have to main functions, in Glosa, as I see it: they
denote the start of a new sentence; and they indicate the presence of a
proper noun - a particular person or place.
      mi fe-fili gina pa dice qestio qe id du pluvi     .......... (1)
  OR
      Mi fe-fili, Gina, pa dice qestio, ~Qe, id du pluvi?~.   .... (2)

    I suspect that each of thes sentences could be marked, with points
accumulating for ambiguity/lack_of_clarity, and I feel that the former
version would show a greater mandicap rating than the latter.
    While the writer of 1. would know where to pause, and where to put
vocal stress, when he read it out, someone else handed the message might
have to think for a while before he could understand the message - as he
thought the writer intended it.
    Someone reading 2. as an 'unseen', on the other hand, has twelve
additional cues to the structure, semantics and unusual components of the
sentence, and could read it with suitable pauses and vocal stress,
directly, by making use of these non-alphanumeric clues.

    Sid, I, for one, find the reading of your posts difficult, because of
the lack of signposts to their structure.

    If you are conducting an experiment, what is its hypothesis, how do you
test it, and when do you know that the hypotesis has been disproved?

    Fashions in language come and go, and some just keep coming.  At
present, the smart young things are leaving out increasing numbers of
commas from their writing.
    I predict that there will ultimately be a swing against this trend ..
when grammar is again taught in our schools.  I am not sure how many
generations will get lost in the wilderness of stream_of_consciousness-type
writing before the cry goes up - for greater clarity in the structure of
prose; things could get a lot worse, before they start getting better.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

    But, I know Ron had the capacity to work at Genius level, and I also
know that I do not.  So, I fear that further years spent in trying to
derive a different formulation, based on present Glosa, and forming a
superior language from it - much as Ron derived Glosa from Interglossa -
would end with me dead, as well, also not seeing the full fruition of the
new form I had created.

    I see my role more as a Beta Tester of Glosa, and not as that of a
co-creator of the world's best 'syntax-based' language.  During the time
that I was Alpha Testing Glossa/Glosa (1982 - 1992) I had a pretty bumpy
ride.  Since entering the Beta Testing phase, I have felt much happier,
there having been many fewer changes.

    Personally, I have not enough room in my life, nor years up my sleeve,
to go through a phase of Alpha Testing, again.  And, if we look at the
progress made, up til now, on the Glosalist, we could predict a very slow
speed of progress, if people were asked to go back to basics, and start
again, with some New Millenium Glosa.
    Ron Clark, after working with Interglossa for about four year, did,
around 1976, clear the slate, and start again - with a revision and
simplification of  Hogben's "outline" of an auxillary language.

    However, it does test my imagination .. to the limit .. to try to push
the basic framework of Glosa(Clark/Ashby, 1992) into a better shape than it
is already.  Agreed, the refinements of vocabulary are calling, and a
clear, simple statement of Glosa's grammar would help, but these are
peripheral to the language's specification, which seems pretty damned good.

    My guess, is, that with urging from Walter and Carmelo, Glosa is due to
take a step forward, not backwards, into Gamma testing.  I welcome this,
and will do my best to trim around the edges, of any ragged pieces
remaining from the Beta Testing phase.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

   One of the original authors is dead, and the second is not as active as
we might have hoped: non-Net and arthritic.

   Sorry about Asterix, but you can start your letters "Karo Fred" and end
them with a non-comicbook, "Saluta."
   Actually, for thousands of years, "Ave!" was more of a farewell. 
   To address "Friends" using Glosa, you might find ~Mi Plu Amika,~ more to
your liking.

   No Glosa is not actually a 'skim' of the worlds languages; it is much
more a "language for science - that can be spoken by the common man, as well."
   And here's a neat concept: recall the teaching of Scientific French and
Scientific Russian, etc; now, imagine that instead of Russian or French
joining words between the scientific terminology, you stick "glue words"
from the same (Greko-Latin) source as the terminology;  you end up with
something that can be called Scientific Scientific.

   Needless to say such a streamlined, simplified language needs a grammar:
Ron Clark, the prime author chose the logical structure of English sentence
construction, but got rid of the five inflections in English, and created a
grammar which is 'syntax-based.'  Recall how computer programming languages
always go on about their syntax - but never about their 'inflections.'  He
thought the language was so simple, obvious and logical that he avoided
publishing a Glosa Grammar: he said the mind sorted it out intuitively; it
is possible that, in this, he over-estimated human capabilities.

*  Just because Glosa uses the plain Euro alphabet, you might imagine that
it is Euro-based.  However consider for a moment, a World auxilliary
language will have to use a single form of graphical representation: what
is you preference?
   Did you know that the Chinese see their language as a potential global
auxilliary with all of its umpteen thousands of characters.

   BTW in your studies of lojban did you find it to be a very precise,
rule-based proscriptive language?  Well human beings don't work like that:
our biological logic circuits are much more fuzzy and imprecise.
   Although I perhaps should not say it, because even the great Chomsky
could not spell it out, Glosa was designed to mirror the 'Universal
Language of Thought.'  Please consider: perhaps Clark, using creativity,
intuited something that Chomsky, with all of his intelligence, did not.

   An easy to follow statement of the grammar is in the process of being
developed, and a course suitable for 'Further Education' is being mooted by
Walter.

   I note that triangles are getting a bad press from the No-NWO people.
And for this reason, I would like to steer clear of triangles, even though
the idea of a "Global Language" could be part of some NWO agenda.

    I always thought that Ron said h'ed written the specification so that
Glosa would be emminently suitable for the machine handling of information.

*  Sorry about the irrational fear.
   Most of the early terms from science are derived from Latin; though,
now, Greek is proving more useful.
   The original word stem is called Indo-European: both Greek and Latin
come from this; and I simplify the phrase "Greek and Latin roots" to saying
"the Classical roots of science."

*  Glad to hear Eo has modern instructional materials.
   Yes Glosa urgently needs multimedia instruction .. as well as good B&W
laser printable instruction, as well.
   Funny you shold mention fairy tales; I did over Three bears, Red Riding
Hood and Cinderella in historical time; these archival items are still on
my website (probaly needing a little editing to update their language usage).
   I intend, in about a month, to get started with Flash MX; however, your
computer skills sound a lot better than mine.  Please stick around: we
probably can use you. 
 
Only Kidding,

  P.S.  Any inputs you can make towards progressing the Glosa saga will be
greatly appreciated.
  P.P.S. Do a Google search on Glosa, and you'll find a lot there;

reluctantly i produce this english - the glosa should have been enough, if 
not we need to think why not ....
i was asked why i was an atheist - answer was, i didn't know so i thought 
perhaps creation theories might help so i cooked up some models
1] there was nothing and then the universe-or-something UOS/KAUR appeared out 
of the blue or whatever colour nothing is
2] the UOS has always been there - back for infinity,  forward for infinity
3] something made the UOS - creator or something COS/FRAUR
but we now need to examine the beginning of COS
4] the COS suddenly started from nothing
5] the COS has always been there
6] the COS was created by another COS - COS -> COS-> COS-> ....... UOS from 
infinity
we can combine 4,5,6 with 1,2,3 - that2 's 9 compinations/permutations or 
something
some are difficult to imagine
there is no way that i can prove which of these is true and, i suspect, 
no-one else can so i apply Ockham's axe. choose the simplest one that seems 
to work. they have become more and more complex from the beginning so back 
there.
1 has nothing and COS, 2 has just COS so that's the one i shall chose till i 
am convinced that one of the others is in fact true 
there is only the universe-or-something and it has always existed.
i shall develop the idea further, later  [in glosa]

that dosn't really explain why i'm an atheist .......

here is part of a Christ book, the Bible, without references to God:-
Christ said that we ought love our nieghbours and he was asked 'who is my 
nieghbour?'
a man travelled from Jerusalem to Jericho but was badly beaten, everything he 
had was stolen and he was left like dead. some people passed but didn't 
help.however, a man from Samaria stopped and gave much help.samarian people 
were despised by the local people.Christ said to love our enenies and forgive 
them - he said many things about loving nieghbours.
if all people did not look at references to God but acted as Christ said, not 
incliding God, the world would be much, much happier

Subject: [glosalist] vocabulary cleanup
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2002 01:43:15 -0800

I've generated a vocabulary of 6730 words from several
international public-domain sources, including the
combined Glosa list, Ido/Novial, the Romance languages,
and a few others. The algorithm is impartial and
reproducible, and capable of improvement and updating.

All words conform to the easily-pronounced bisyllabic
consonant-vowel pattern, resembling the "scientific
combining forms" in ease of compounding, yet still
remain somewhat recognizable or at least plausible
at-first-sight to Romance speakers.

While not "perfect" or "final", this appears much
more attractive and practical than the current
Glosa vocabulary. I think it would be a good basis
for the necessary Glosa reforms. It is even possible
to write tolerable pidginesque text by using it
experimentally without any grammatical particles.

If anyone here is interested. In the last world-war
most interest in IALs died; looks like a repeat now.

imagine a very small animal. it has fur, blunt nose,
a short tail and small bright eyes. he sleeps in a hole in the ground during 
the day and feeds on plants near his hole, at night. he lives alone, he keeps 
away from other males and they keep away from him. if a female comes, he 
welcomes her for a short time and then she goes away.

dear Robin and all
Robin asks me if I am experimenting, yes, and investigating too. I have been 
a glosa-pe for about 30 years [an esperanto person for about half an hour]. 
if I had not thought highly of G, I would have left it long ago, however, I 
think that like everything else in the world, there are shortcomings and it 
is these that I am looking at. also I was in touch with hindi and similar 
languages while i was teaching and helping boys from southern asia.
my views on full stops seem to be misunderstood rather. If I were 
[hand]writing in G or any other language with the roman alphabet and could 
keep my writing legible, i would make the dot at the end of a sentence 
largish and slightly far away from the last letter. no problems in seeing it 
and it works perfectly adequately.
however in some type fonts the dot is tiny and put next to the last 'd'. as 
far as i am concerned the dot is invisible and looks like part of the 
squiggly bit at the end of the letter [serif]. i just can't see it! This 
seems to have been noticed long, long ago. Instead of doing something about 
the dot, it has been decide to make the following letter a capital. now we 
have to learn 52 letters instead of 26 and we have the end doubly and 
redundantly marked!

Tom Croft grafo (mero):
> There is not a law under which     
> es na u nomi infra qi 

~na~ is we/us/our in Glosa  guess this is just your
tired fingers playing tricks.

If liked, this there is ~il~, but this is not
required.

is not a law is ~ne es u nomi~ or this could be 
there is no law ~Es zero nomi or Es nuli nomi

This is where the semicolon comes in to mark the
beginning of the new clause. Often this is marked in
English by the word that which is omitted in
official Glosa (unofficially it is ~ke~). The
semicolon also marks the end of the clause, if there
is a return to the original main clause, which very
often there isnt, as in these sentences.

** Es zero nomi;

under this is probably by means of ~per~


> any part of this universe is	   
> ali-mero de u-ci universa es 

> governed that does not come	   
> regula; qi na implika 

is governed /is organised  this is a passive
construction so ~gene regula~.

that is covered by the semicolon.

** ali-mero de u-ci universa gene regula per; 

> into play in the phenomena of	   
> intra 

> the chemical history of a	   
> u kemi histori de

> candle.  There is no better	   
> kandela. es na ma-boni 

** u kemi histori de kandela ne gene implika.

** Ne es u ma-boni

> door by which you can enter	   
> mode a ki ad-in 

to enter would be ~de ki~ of entering
to begin ~de proto~

> into the study of natural
> u studi de skience 

** mode de proto u stude de skience

> philosophy than by considering
> hetero de kura puta


> the physical phenomena of a
> u reali feno de u   

physical phenomena ~plu fisika akti~

For me ~feno~ is more for things that are not real, 
where as phenomena is the behaviour.

~u reali feno~ the real appearance = the true
nature?

~de u~ - ~u~ is normally omitted after a preposition.

Also sometimes ~plu~
a herd of cows = ~u grega de bovi~ 
[~plu~ omitted because ~grega~ tells you it is
plural.]


> candle.
> kandela.

** hetero de kura puta de plu fisika akti de kandela.

[Note: I stole your neat use of ~hetero~ there!]
 

> mi pa fo-amo u histori de u [[Chinese]] piski a

Chinese/China is just ~Cina~ in Glosa. I guess the
international usage wins out here rather than the
local name, which would be more typically the Glosa
choice.

Subject: Re: [glosalist] toward a standard Glosa
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2002 15:03:38 EST

last week there was one glosa-pe [me] above the clouds at the foot of mount 
teide looking across at the top of gran canaria peeping above its clouds and 
perhaps with another glosa-pe on that island. Time to think about glosa which 
seems to be in the clouds itself just now.

I find that I am quite often confused by glosa and other people are confused 
by my burblings. I should like there to be something like a 
standard/normal/orthodoxofficial-glosa2002,  clearly explained so that I 
could write it easily. I may not agree with it and think that there would 
still be confusions but I would know where I stood and could write it.
let us call it 'SG'.
SG would be a euro-glosa as it would assume that its followers would have a 
grounding in european languages, they would understand  SG's having 23 [or 
24?] letter sounds and 48 letter signs to represent them. They would also 
accept the 3 irregularities [q,x and sc]. 

Half of the signs would be commonly used [lower-case] and the others 
[capitals] only used in certain circumstances such as:-
at the beginning of sentences, to begin proper nouns  [what exactly are 
they?] in abreviations etc
A proper noun seems to be like names of people, pets, geographical locations 
etc - 'Robin', 'England', 'Mount Teide', 'Rex'. If I am to write correct 
Glosa, I should like to know exactly when SG  requires caps. 


Mi fu grafo u-ci frasi in norma, [orthodox] Glosa. U lexiko qi ST fu uti, es 
u 'Glosa Inter-Reti Diktionaria' [G.I.R.D].  Ci, na habe u hetera regula:- In 
u titula, singu verba sti ko u kapitali. Qe il fu es ali excepti ad u-ci 
regula homo il es in English? 

being a rebellious and inquisitive child I shall also investigate 'munada 
linugu' which has 23 letter sounds and also 23 letter signs ....
mi fu garafo uci farasi in norama m.l. - u lexiko qui m.l. fu uti, es u  
'g.i.r.d'. - ze kapitali ... ze regula de mu -

So far, do established glosa-pe agree with my view of a standard Glosa with 
letter signs and capitals following the rules above ?

That's how it is and must remain. Anything else would lose.

*   Hi William,
    I have not seen your call-sign for some time.  Nice to see you are
still attached.
    Things have gone slower than expected, and with Ron Clark passing on,
and Wendy Ashby somewhat deactivated by arthritis, we are not pushing ahead
quite as fast as we might have been.
    I have said I will do a 2500-word Starter Dictionary, but have been
side-tracked by financial concerns and the Great Australian Drought.  After
my finances settle down - possibly before the New Year - I will seriously
try to gel a medium-sized starter dictionary.  For this I will rely mainly
on the GID and on standard English-language small lists of commonly-used
words.

    Please share your thoughts: what, as you see it, are the immediate
goals and challenges for Glosa?

    If you are still using Glosa, you might like to put a short children's

    Wendy has produced PGN 87.  I will scan it and send it out to all on
Glosalist if I recieve requests.

*Hi to Rob Harris and others New to Glosa.
   Hearing Glosa spoken will be difficult.
   It is Old and New: It is as old as the Indo-European (proto-Aryian) root
stock; it watches as this bifurcates into Greek and Latin; then it draws
the threads together into what remains of the Greek and Latin roots - as
represented in modern science.
   So, Glosa is a synthesis of the very old with the usage of the rather new.
   Sounds like Italian.
   Sentence formation with the structures of English.
   Words are concept centres, rather than concrete objects.
   So, Glosa words, from the Classical languages, are shorn of their
inflectional endings, and represent ideas.
   They are used, within reason, to function as any Part-of-Speech.
   The intepretation of a word's function is given by its place in the
phrase or clause: SYNTAX is the grammar engine of Glosa.
   Oh yes, there's one rule: a word is modified by its precedent(s).
Modifiers precede the word they modify.  And while it is somewhat
misleading to use the categories of 'adjective' and 'adverb', it is still
handy to think in terms of the traditional functions within a sentence.

            S         |     V     |      O

      modifiers | N       V  | ^      mod. | N
                               |
                              Verb 
                            Auxilliary 
                      |             |
                      |Compound verb|

   Yet Glosa is not "relexified English".
   Good Glosa 'maps onto' English, BUT English does not automatically 'map
onto' Glosa.

   Glosa users are spread so widely that they are too far away from one
another to hear each other: there are also some problems with the mechanics
of sound files on the Net; and, at the start, Glosa users needs to think
about the words they will use - this can slow down speech, for learners.
In Glosa we ought to use the correct concept rather than slip into
metaphor.  National-language idiomatic usage would be too confusing
altogether.

   Of the national languages, English might be the closest to Glosa in that
it has only five inflected endings, and has a background in both Greek and
Latin.  Also, the SVO order, and the structure of phrases and their
combination into clauses, in English, is considered, by some, to have the
most logical of constructions, and to allow the widest expression of
meanings.  Of course, among the highly inflected languages terribly fine
shades of meaning are possible, EG Russian; Glosa, having NO inflections
benefits greatly from economy of form, but relies on the juxtaposition of
words for its precision.

   What is also similar between English and Glosa is that the
(syntax-based) grammar is more intuitive than proscribed.  Nobody stood up
one day, and said, "Listen here, this is how the syntax of English is going
to go."
   It is claimed that the language sense is hard-wired into our brains, and
that this relies primarily on word order (syntax).  So, while every
language that is spoken is used more or less intuitively, English (and
Glosa) with little (or no) inflections, could work more closely to the way
our brains are 'hard-wired' to work than do the lanuages that are more
inflected. 
  
   With the way things are going on the international scene, we might even
have to wait for civilisation to come around again, before Glosa is heard
on broadcast media.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

the situation with the chickens has improved.
the boss is less likely to be challenged or the lady with the brush will 
intervene.
the poor little chicken at the bottom of the group who was pecked and chased 
by all the others is also safe for the same reason. those in between can know 
their places 
and, because there is less fighting, there is more food for everyone.
 now! substitute the boss chicken by the human lord of the manor, the other 
chickens by other strata of human society and the lady with the brush by the 
creator. 
the idea of the creator helps to steady society. society will be happy to 
believe in this creator.
on the other hand our little furry animal's situation is unaffected by the 
idea of a creator and solitary humans may not be interested. the present 
writer tends to be rather solitary so the existence of a creator is not very 
important to him. he does not believe that there is one but he does not deny 
that there may be one.

Syd suggests:

> all words begin with consonant and end with vowel,

That would be good if euro-recognition can be sacrificed.
In that case, might as well go the next step as well,
and use 100% bi-syllabic root-concepts. Then it's easy
to compound, generating a huge vocab from the basic set.

thinking of using roget's thesaurus. first 85 or so syllables of m.l. would 
point to 85 main divisions of the thesurus the next to the  subdivisions.

I like that idea for several reasons, but it's difficult to do right.
Glosa itself has a basic word-list drawn from Roget. Today there are
other (more scientific) multi-lingual lists, such as EuroWordNet,
which better dissect(s) the top levels of an appropriate "ontology".

A language called "Ro" made 100 top-level divisions, each assigned
to a consonant-vowel pair as you suggest, and these included also the
grammatical necessities such as noun verb etc. There is a good web page
for Ro somewhere under Jeffrey Henning's http://langmaker.com ...
Subdivisions used only 1 letter apiece, completely arbitrarily.

Natural languages have better and easier ways to achieve derivation.
For an auxiliary language, there is extreme pressure to simplify.
The most flexible way is just to word-compound. Tunu is a modern
conlang/auxlang that has only 1500 CVCV-type roots (e.g. "babu")
but systematically derives all the words in several basic-English
word-lists by CVCV-CVCV compounding (e.g. "babu-fufa"). Such a
language would be the easiest for a global (non-euro) audience.

The universal human linguistic tendency is to evolve roots toward
bisyllabic CVCV, and then erode the highest usage/frequency ones
into CV particles (which may be pre- or post-positioned, and may
become affixed to roots). There was a euro-based interlingua spoken
all around the Mediterranean for 800 years called "Lingua Franca"
that followed this pattern, and Glosa should emulate it.

If it is acceptable to sacrifice euro-recognizability, then the
required modifications to G can be very few and nearly painless.
"Supo la perde di reco a Euro, impli la recui cambi di G i posi
poco, anci cuasi manca pena". Or something kinda like that.

Yep, still around! If the context were Esperanto I guess you could say
I kabeis ... Kabe (Kazimierz Bein) was a fellow who did a bunch of work
in Esperanto and then dropped out, thereby earning himself a verb of his
own in Esperanto culture to describe such behavior. Well, I didn't do as
much work as he did (though I did spend many enjoyable hours with the
Glosa dictionary), and I didn't drop out completely, but I did shift my
focus back to Esperanto.

But I have kept the glosalist archives up-to-date! ...

http://www.kafejo.com/lingvoj/auxlangs/glosa/archives/

Esperanto and Glosa aren't really all that different structurally.

Salata!

P.S. I've found that the salut/salat wordplay works in quite a
few languages. Perhaps with time I can make the international

Here are extracts from PGN87 perhaps for a projected tutorial. It is probably 
more useful to become at ease with translating from Glosa to English or other 
tongue befare doing much into Glosa. We need pieces of Glosa that are 
actually in use rather than purpose built examples and we need to get clear 
the structures of the sentences. There has been a tendency in English and in 
Glosa to shrink away from grammar. Earlier in tutors one was given long lists 
and tables especially of irregularities. Here is the first sentence in this 
PGN, my apologies to its author for not asking permission.

[alphabet and sounds can be inserted later]

'Tem pre oligo meno plu nova-papira-pe e komerci-pe pa dice de u ski de plu 
lingua in Englanda.' 

 [EXTRA PHRASE(time)  while before few months  [Tem pre oligo meno] = a few 
months ago    
SUBJECT      some newspaper-people and commerce-people   [plu nova-papira-pe

VERB         did speak   [pa dice] 
OBJECT       of the know   [de u ski]
             of the languages   [de plu lingua]
             in England  [in Englanda]

introducing words:- 'plu'/some introduces the subject noun phrase
'did' introduces the verb phrase
'of the' introduces the object phrase
'while before' introduces the extra phrase of time

'people' are the two head words in the subject phrase
'speak' is the head word in the verb phrase
'know' is the head of the object
'months' is the head of the extra phrase

'newspaper'/'commerce' modify [ help/clarify/add to the meaning of] 'people'
'of the languages' modifies 'know'
'in England' modifies 'languages'
EXTRA modifies the verb phrase
'few' introduces months [a noun phrase inside an extra phrase]

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary updated
From: "Marcel Springer" <marcel{at}mspringer{dot}de>
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2002 11:37:33 +0100


The Glosa-dictionary on http://www.glosa.org/gid/ has been updated.


I have compared the word list of the book "Français - Glosa 1000" with
the Glosa Internet Dictionary.  Result:

241 corrections or little changes were made to the French list.
    (Mostly missing French accents and wrong "Similar Synonyms".
     Files:
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frgl1ko.htm  - old, original list,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frgl1k.htm   - new, corrected list,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/gl1kfr.htm   - corrected list, reversed,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frglcorr.htm - protocol of changes)

And about 1000 (!) additions/little changes/corrections were made to
the GID.  For example 61 new Similar Synonyms were found and cleared
  (File: http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm ).
Many, many English meanings
  (e. g.
  "amusa 1++  amuse; amusement; entertain" <-- "funny" (drôle).
  "magika 1++G  magic; magic spell" <-- "enchant" (enchanter).
  "melano 1++G  black" <-- "dark" (foncé).
  "merito 1++  deserve; earn; merit" <-- "worthy" (digne de).
  "pove 1++  poor" <-- "miserable" (misérable).
  "xanto 1++G  yellow; yolk" <-- "blond" (blond).)
and many new items have been added.
  (e. g.
  "agri-pe 1++  farmer; labourer [agricultural ]" (cultivateur).
  "duce-do 1  town hall; hall [town ]; city hall" (mairie).
  "ergo-pe 1  worker" (ouvrier).
  "graci 1  grace" (grâce).
  "kapila-pe 1  hairdresser; barber" (coiffeur).
  "kloro-zo 1  green belt; belt [green ]" (ceinture verte).
  "pani-bo 1  baker's {shop}; baker's shop" (boulangerie).
  "pani-pe 1  baker" (boulanger).
  "pasivi 1  passive" (passive).
  "piski-pe 1  fisherman" (pêcheur).
  "principi 1  principle" (principe).
  "servieta 1  napkin" (serviette).
  "tropi-ru 1  screwdriver" (tourne-vis).).


I am happy, that the dictionary has made another advance, but it can
be seen, that there is a far way to go, yet:  So many changes only
by comparison with one little list!  It would be good to have a
detailed look at the list "Deutsch - Glosa 1000" as well, I think.

The book "Español - Glosa 1000" does not look as important, because it
seems to be only a translation of an English list made by a
non-Glosa-author.

Here there are some questions I asked Wendy Ashby and her answers.
Sorry, I am late, my letter was from May the 5th and her from June

Possessive Pronoun
==================

In inter-reti na diskusi de u loka de "possessive pronoun".

In classical Glosa the possessive pronoun seems to come before
u(n)/plu:  mi plu vagona - my cars.  Some people in internet (me too)
rather would like to put it after it.

Advantages:
- It would be more regular.  A noun phrase then always would start
  with a (mandatory) u(n)/plu, the main concept word (noun) comes last
  and all attributes - adjectives, genitives, participles and also the
  possessive pronoun - would come between.
- A noun phrase could be easier acknowledged, when it starts with
  u(n)/plu.
- Appositions: "Mi ne amo plu vi simi - I do not like your apes." /
  "... vi plu simi - ... you apes"

Nick contradicts with the example "u fe bovi - a (female) cow,
fe u bovi - her cow", but this does not convince me (could be
"fe-bovi").  Also I do not think, that there could be confusions with
u-mi, u-tu etc.

Perhaps you can explain, why it must (or only should?) be like this?

 - - - - -

WA: "vi plu simi".  Plu kron "plu" es no-nece.  "vi" es ma de mo.
    "vi simi" es sati.
    Hogben e Ron pa uti "plu tu simi" = your apes (mo persona e ma de
    mo simi).
    Si konfusi es posi Hogben e Ron pa uti "plu simi de tu".  Mu ma
    amo u-ci kausa "plu" veni imedia pre "simi".  Na zero kron pa dice
    de muta u-ci sistema.
    Freqe "u/un" e "plu" es no-nece.  Exempla:
    mo bibli -, tri bibli -, poli bibli -, oligo bibli -, zero bibli
    es epi tabla.

    Fe-bovi = cow, female ox
    bovi-fe = cow-girl
    fe bovi alo bovi de fe = her cow.
    Pende itera ex kontextu e metro de exakti info es nece.  Hogben
    ma amo uti exakti "bovi de fe".  Sed in tako dice e grafo, poli-pe
    ma amo uti "fe bovi".  Na (Ron e mi) pa amo un exakti de plu frase
    de Hogben kausa mu evita ero translati; anti-co tem uti ma longi
    frase in tako dice e tako grafo plu persona freqe ma amo brevi id
    e evita "de" etc.

[I find this question very important!!!  I understood,
  "'u(n)/plu' - possessive pronoun - noun"
is okay, but prefereable, if the sentence is not too long, is
  "'u(n)/plu' - noun - 'de' - possessive pronoun".]

  "couldn't help" = "couldn't suppress" = "alexi proto"

  "sto" = "stop" = "fini" ridi.
Po-co Nick grafo; "sto - suppress; prevent" es in inter-reti
verba-lista.  E an habe veri.  Plu-ci semani veni ex bibli

    Si tu ne amo "sto" posi tu ma amo:
      "tena se" = restrain myself
      alo "resista se" = resist myself.

[I understood, that "sto" does not make a difference, whether the
action to be stopped or prevented has already started or not.
Supplemented in Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"resista se 1  resist oneself" item added.
"tena se 1  restrain oneself" item added.]

    Glosa 1000 = kroma es "rubi-xanto".

[In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:

"rubi-xanto 1++  orange {colour}" unchanged.
"orange {French}  orange {colour}" item added.]
-----------------------------------------------------------

WA: Fotografo-me + kamera = camera.
    Plu proto fotografi-me pa es "pusi kamera".

[Typical: one line fotografO-me, then fotografI-me.
-i is prefereable, because photography is an international word.
In Glosa Inter-reti Diktionaria:
"fotografi-me 1+*  camera {apparatus}" removed "*".
"kamera 1++  accomodate; apartment; camera {room}; chamber; hall; room"
  added meaning "camera {apparatus}".]

She is correct in placement of the possessive/genitive.
Here you have 2 noun phrases combined with or without a
particle. Each can be singular or plural, independently.
Clearest usage invokes the particle DE (and/or SU) to
separate the possessor from the possessed, but in the
real-world, people often elide it, leaving ambiguity.
So "tu simi" could be either insulting or not depending
on context; re-inserting a SU or ES would disambiguate.
(SU is just my suggestion for a new particle to be the
reverse of DE, i.e. the so-called Saxon genitive.)
But she suggests "fe bovi" as a natural elision; most
of the world would prefer "bovi fe" (from elided DE).

> Si tu ne amo "sto" posi tu ma amo:
> "tena se" = restrain myself

I consider the STI and STO of Hogben completely bogus.
TENA is better, but then I'd want 100% bisyllabic roots.
(Words like KONFUSI and IMEDIA also appear bogus to me.)
The truest Glosa has a self-consistency beyond authority.

'St. Lucia es u landa in orienta Karibean Mari.'

SUBJECT St. Lucia [St. Lucia]
VERB is [es]
OBJECT a land [u landa]
   in east Caribean Sea [in orienta Karibean Mari.]

capital S denotes beginning of sentence also, here, a name [an island]; 
capitals L, K, M denote names [an island and a sea]. Because it is a name and 
therefore a noun there is only one being refered to so no number is needed to 
introduce the phrases
In glosa, a word can be verb, noun etc. In this sentence, 'es' is unlikely to 
be anything but a verb so it is easy to decide which is subject and which is 
objekt.


'Id tegu 620 qadra kilometri.' 
 SUBJECT[S] it [Id]
VERB[V] cover [tegu]
OBJECT[O] 620 square kilometre [620 qadra kilometri]

'tegu' could be 'the cover', 'to cover', 'the covered object'but as it 
imediately follows the pronoun 'id', it must be the verb.

a parallel investigation into the developing of munada linugu



SG
'Tem pre oligo meno plu nova-papira-pe e komerci-pe pa dice de u ski de plu 
lingua in Englanda.'

ml:-
'teme pere oligo meno, lu pe-papira-nova e pe-komerici pa dice de u siki de 
lu linugu in Enege-lanada - ' 

here the head  word [oligo, pe, dice] follows the intro word  [teme, pere, lu 
pa u] and a word is modified by the word after it. this is completely 
different from glosa but it makes it much easier to find the head.
the comma indicates that the previous phrase is EXTRA and that the next is 
SUBJECT
all letters are pronounced as in the international phonetic alphabet.

greetings glosa-pe! hope that santa's visit is productive.
apologies also for putting my wanderings into the wilderness on glosalist, 
some may find them interesting.
apologies to charles . his letter with web sites addresses seems to be lost 
in my wilderness. could you repeat them?

I have a copy of roget so i shall do some maths with it.
there are the consonants:- b[0] c[1] d[2] f[3] g[4] j[5] k[6] l[7] m[8] n[9] 
p[10] r[11] s[12] t[13] v[14] x[15] z[16] and the 5vowels aeiou [0 to 4]. 
this makes 85 CV syllables.

if we look up 'world-wide' in roget's index, we get 3 sections, i choose 
'universal' which is section 79. counting the items that are apropriate,    
'world-wide' is number 81 [my maths may be askew but my argument will be 
demonstrated]
divide the section number by the number of CV syllables:- 79/85=0 + remainder 
79
same with item number:- 81/85=0+81
divide the 79 by 5 [syllables ba, be, bi, bo, bu, ca, ce,  etc], we get 14 
consonants remainder 4 = vowels. result ='vu'  add'-'
0/5+0=0; syllable 0='ba' add to the others:- vu-ba
81/5=16+rem1:- ze so 'world-wide becomes 'vu-baze [put the stress on the 
vowel before the '-'.
'language' is section 557 first item [ignore], 
557/85 gives 6 rem 43
6/5 gives 1 rem 1 i.e. 'ce'
43 gives 8 rem 3,      'mo'
'cemo' stress on last syllable
'worldwide language' = 'vu-baze cemo'

[this is a reply to 2 messages, saving virtual paper]

> VERB is [es]

I feel that Glosa is the auxlang for people who hate grammar.
To satisfy them most deeply, I propose the elimination of verbs
and adjectives, etc, leaving only "plain words" (of 2 syllables
or maybe more) and "magic words" (1 syllable only). Words like
is/have/do are "magic" and we never need to spook the potential
clients by use of that intimidating V-word.

> SUBJECT[S] it [Id]
> VERB[V] cover [tegu]
> OBJECT[O] 620 square kilometre [620 qadra kilometri]

I expected "has" instead of "cover". All simple sentences can be
recast to use one of a dozen or so magic auxiliaries instead of
troublesome iffy verbs like "cover".

> and a word is modified by the word after it. this is completely
> different from glosa but it makes it much easier to find the head.

There are 2 problems here (adjectives, compounds) that seem
like 1 (modifiers), and they need different solutions.

True adjectives as in English are not common in other languages,
most either are treated as verbs (e.g. Japanese) or nouns (Latin).
It is possible to allow either word order without chaos:
"white house" = "casa blanca" = "blanca casa" = "house white".
When it becomes necessary to precise the meaning further,
magic words like DE/A/EX restore order within the phrase.

Compound words are the tougher problem, because we really need
to declare for one order or the other. Especially if the vocab
is reduced to approx 5000 CVCV roots, compounding must generate
most of the 50000 or so real-world words in the full lexicon.
I don't know which is best -- but "blancacasa" sounds silly.
Maybe the answer is just to forbid such compounds?

For a good sample of these things see the Kalatunu web page,
wherever that has wandered off to ... or for a bad example,
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/tomato.htm (apologies in advance).

> his letter with web sites addresses seems to be lost

It's in the archives of that Ailanto Kafejo fellow.
Anyway you can find anything at google.com ...

> divide the section number by the number of CV syllables

I have several different Roget's from used book sales.
One has a numerical scheme that goes like:

EPIDEMIC, as in
	plague 85.5
	contagious 85.61
	prevalent 863.12
	plentiful 990.7

So all we need are 11 consonants and 11 vowels ...

In original Roget's there were around 1000 major
headings which grouped all words, so a CVC pattern
could handle them all comfortably (20 * 5 * 20 = 2000).

Or we could use the sorted-by-frequency BNC list:
1=the 2=of ... 996=president 997=house ... 199997=horsefly

More seriously, the EuroWordNet project identified a good
base set of word-concepts shared by most euro langs.

I have generated a list of English words translated by
multi-lingual dictionaries; if they don't appear there,
they must not be important ... Here are the FAM- entries
above level 11, higher number indicating higher frequency:

35      fame
15      famed
16      familial
27      familiar
17      familiarity
15      familiarization
16      familiarize
15      familiarized
15      familiarizes
15      familiarizing
12      familiarly
17      families
35      family
27      famine
12      famines
15      famish
12      famished
35      famous
12      famously

I think this implies the need for FAME, FAMILY, FAMINE
and maybe FAMILIAR in any plausible auxlang's base vocab.

  Without actually having studied Glosa, you have done exceedingly well, Tom.
  Beware of word-for-word translation, in that English-language metaphors
and idioms can be translated unthinkingly.
  While the above original paragraph is good poetry and also a profound
thought, translation of such imaginitive language was not the original
intention for Glosa.  And, while I was going to do a pedrestrian version of
the passage, I thought better of it.
  The fact remains that Glosa was put forward originally as a language for
science; and it was intended for direct communication of fact.

  The version I did is more plodding than your leaner version, Tom, but it
has more "T"s crossed and "I"s dotted.
  So, I strongly reccommend trying a few straight sentences first, before
^going out on a limb^ into poetry.
  While Glosa is highly suitable for poetry, I suspect that it will be more
like the classical Chinese poetry, where because of the word economy, both
the meaning and the words of a poem will have to be taught.

  You ask about the use of the semi-colon in Glosa.  The authors originally
postulated that, because of the major role of syntax in Glosa's grammar,
and the fact that punctuation becomes even more of an aid to the
understanding of structure in Glosa, than it is in English,  
that it would be useful to indicate the start of phrases and clauses
differently in Glosa.  Commas, in Glosa, as in English, are the logical
choice to indicate the start of phrases; however, to differentiate between
phrases and clauses, it was decided that the semi-colon would indicate the
start of a clause, where this was needed for clear understanding.
  Regardless of the authors' advice, a number of Glosa enthusiasts have
declared the semi-colon to be ugly and unwarranted, so they persist in
using commas to introduce clauses.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

why bother with grammar?
when we gradually learn our native tongue we are not given the grammar rules 
at the beginning. They are there nevertheless and we sort them out to a 
greater or lesser degree as we go along. why not do the same with Glosa? It 
is not all that easy and pretty slow. much quicker if it is done for us as 
soon as possible, appropriately and as one reads. that's what I'm hoping to 
do.

As/to a would-be creator/inventor/discoverer of language:

You can start with just the roots in a jargon/pidgin stage
like the Chinook Jargon (see the wonderful web site of
Tenas Wawa, somewhere under geocities.com last I looked).
Then you can import a few particles or affixes and get
something more like the Lingua Franca. These were both
real-world, useful auxlangs. And were spoken seriously
by more people than have ever tried Esperanto etc.

The major point to stop forgetting is that an auxlang
must be learned not by children who have the luxury of
100% immersive language brainwashing, but rather by
adults struggling to make a real life who have only a
few hours per week to devote to language study. It had
better not be just a toy language devised imaginatively
but ignorant of linguistic principles, because it won't
work right, and people will drop it just like Glosa etc.

I must admit to losing all hope for Glosa since the
surviving author refuses to either lead or get out
of the way. Nor do I retain any hope that some new
Grand Datuval (see history of Volapuk) will devise
anything better than the 10,000 conlangs already
littering the net (I made one, too) -- none of them
are near good-enough, either. So now it's just English
against the world, later it will be Spanish etc.

You need 3000 to 6000 good short mnemonic roots,
100 particles or affixes, and simple sentence patterns.
Then you must find a bunch of people to agree to use them,
on a continuing, daily basis. Or you just add one more
useless auxlang/conlang/artlang to the trash heap.

Never mind. I can just wait out your manic period in silence.

Now, what is called for is a Nu-speak for the Net.
   Some form of Munda-lingua must eventually emerge for Cyberspace.
   Considering that Spanish is taking over the US, with the infiltration of
all those wet-backs, and that Spanish is easier to learn than English, such
a language could be it.
   If Glosa can be demonstrated to be a regularised language, with
generally international vocabulary ... also with the logical power of
English, it might beat Spanish.  At the present rate of development, there
is no contest.

*  Funny thing, the techology is in place for the high-level teaching of
any language, and Glosa characters have been kept within the normal
keyboard range.
   I do plan to get the Flash MX set-up, when I can find a student who will
let me buy it on their student card.  And yes, the question remains: can
mind-dead executives learn to think in Glosa.
   So, instructional courses pitched at various levels are needed, and for
a while we had a thing going with various groups in Uganda.  The endemic
poverty in that country was both the reason that they responded to our
call, and also the reason for the difficulties we had in supplying them
with materials and equipment.  X = 0
   The other problem that did arise - quite surprisingly to me - was the
reluctance of the would-be Glosa learners to attempt to write in the
language, quite apart from trying to speak in it.
   You could say we had a problem.
   While Glosa appears to follow, and extend, the developmental trend of
the highly successful super-creole, English, it has ended at one extreme of
the linguistic spectrum ... being devoid of inflection.  Now, all national
languages have some inflection, and, while the very heavily inflected,
Latin has bitten the dust, some very popular languages, like Russian, are
extremely strong on inflection, still.  Chinese does stand out as having
unchanging characters. Where have I heard that word "unchanging" before?
   Even though the Chinese could take to Glosa, as the European-like
language whose sentence structure is closest to theirs, I suspect that
'inflection' could be part of the 'hard-wiring of language' built into our
brains.  However, I am convinced that the Universal Grammar, whatever it
is, is primarily Syntax-Based, as is Glosa.

*  Well, do we mean that people have dropped Glosa, or that people would
drop Glosa if they found it to be more of a 'toy language' than a real one?
   Part of my brief is to demonstrate that Glosa is a usable pedestrian
language, suitable for everyday intercommunication, as well as a language
that permits the conveying of exact meaning.
   As I see it, the everyday usage ought to come before the more
complicated employment of Glosa.  I do believe that the structure is sound,
and that the innovation of semantic "inflections" can be effected through a
simple system of compounding.

>I must admit to losing all hope for Glosa since the

*  True, Wendy Ashby ought to get over her arthritis or hand the reins on
to someone, or to some group, capable of developing and 'completing' the
language.  A more dynamic leadership, with a definite 'marketing plan'
could do wonders for Glosa.
   Wendy could make a miraculous recovery, and the language could be
completed to the global dissemination stage.  It seems that our prayers are
in order, here.

Nor do I retain any hope that some new

*  I had imagined, long ago, that highly creative people, dissatisfied with
the global mish-mash of language, would have arisen to broaden the Internet
by adding the missing global communication medium to the Net: quel domage.

English is a lovable communication medium, but its patchwork nature does
not suit it to the global learning required for global use.  Another
national language, like Spanish, could succeed where English is failing,
but does Spanish provide sufficient foundation for the next stage of
civilisation?

*  I am sorry that Charles experience of Interlinguistics has soured his
view.  The numbers above, sound true, though I don't think we need quite so
many particles and affixes - though were we to compile a list of all those
of Glosa, including the generic extensions, we might come close to Charles'
hundred.
   The final cruncher is that human beings are so unbelievably optimistic.
We keep thinking that some bright spark will come along, invent something,
and then all of our problems .. of communication, language, etc .. will be
over.
   The sad part is that when people are sitting on top of the mountain,
they do not realise that they have arrived, and that it is up to them to
plant the flag.  I believe that Glosa needs only a little tweaking - with
no serious change in substance - to flatten  the bumps and smoothe around
the sharp edges.  Some form of administration could be derived to maintain
Wendy's authority, while opening the regulation of the language to a more
vigorous group of trustee/developers.
   But, what is urgently needed is for Glosa-pe to use (or try) the
language.  It was only when I took the plunge, and started converting the
"Three Bears" into Glosa, that I came up against the practical questions
involved in using the language.  I wanted to capture Goldilocks' anguish,
and the bears' sense of loss, as she ran from them: I was not content with
simply telling a story.
   As Ron Clark said to me, twenty-five years ago, "Play with the language."

*  I agree with Sid that Glosa grammar need not be taught as a
pre-requisite to using Glosa, but I feel that properly graded reading
allows the gradual introduction of the various grammatical elements.
   However, some people will demand to know why .. this, and why .. that.
So, if Glosa teaching is based on the hypertext principle, people will be
able to read - taking the grammar 'on trust' - until they find the need to
back-track and check a link from the basic text to its associated
explanation.  This idea makes a story readily accessible to the fast
learner, while giving all of the back-up required for those who need
explanations.

   It's fairly obvious that I am thinking in terms of releasing Glosa
learning materials on CDs using HTML coding.  For the non-Net versions, the
explanations would, I imagine, be better on the adjoining page, rather
than, serially, throughout the text.

*** One request from me to Sid: please bring in your right margin; this
allows for the inevitable expansion of text that follows addition of the
standard email quote-marks.  Thanx.

*  Thank you Sid,
   I agree with the substance of all that you say: I'd just like to think
that the explanations were not necessarily so lengthy.
   As I understand it, we do not want to make the explanations of Glosa's
functioning so intrusive that they interrupt the flow of the ideas in the
text.
   However, to make use of such detailed explanations as yours, here,
perhaps we neet to think hard about the format and staging of such
explanations.  Before I heavy-handedly suggest alternative formats, I would
ask you, Sid, to think of ways you could keep the explanations relevant to
the sections of text they elucidate, while maintaining the integrity of the
basic text.

***  Please note: I did shorten the line lengths to allow the RHS margin to

*  There is an interesting conceptual conflict going on.
   For me the understanding of Glosa follows from the rather traditional
ideas of phrases and clauses, and the functioning of the words that make
them up.
   As an extra level of syntax understanding, the more 'Functional Grammar'
idea of the "head" word of a phrase solidified this for me.  But, I see the
'head' of a NOUN PHRASE as the main NOUN; and the 'head' of a VERB PHRASE
as the main VERB.  And then, when it finally came to me, that Ron Clark's
dictum, "A word is modified by its precedent," leads to a fairly clear-cut
'head-final' structure in the phrases, things fell into place.
   So, it is mystifying to me that Sid does not recognise the final word in
a phrase as the 'head' of that phrase.  As I see it, the phrase builds in
semantic power from the least significant word at the start, to the most
semantically significant word at the end: this last word is the 'head.'

  And, without being unkind, nor through calling upon another lqanguage, I
would expand Wendy's ADVERBIAL PHRASE, 'Tem pre oligo meno,' to make the
time relationship painfully clear: 

                  ~Tem plu previo oligo meno, ... ~
            /          /      \       \     \
 [for,during] [all of the] [previous] [few] [months]

   Each word contributes to the full modification of the central VERB
~dice~, and the logic of the situation tells us that the order is fairly
set, in that we cannot change the order without causing the phrase to sound
odd.  This logic is based on the notion that each successive word is more
semantically important that the last,
   IE re time --> countable --> before now --> quantity --> unit of time

   It can be said that I believe there is a full sentence from which words
might be elided to make up a more vernacular version of Glosa.  It can also
be said that I feel learners ought to be taught to use the 'full version'
of Glosa before they start to move to a more elided version of the language.
   This expanded Glosa might be described as the more 'discursive' mode of
the language; while Ron Clark often mentioned the 'telegramatic' use of
Glosa, I feel that such an abbreviated usage should come only with a clear
understanding of the words we are leaving out. 
   
>the comma indicates that the previous phrase is EXTRA and that the next is 
>SUBJECT
*  This is only fair to the reader: puctuation is an indication of the
syntactic units of the sentence.  While "EXTRA" might be meaningful to Sid,
the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY and HOW answered by ADVERBIAL PHRASES and
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES have more analytical value for me.  I saw this more as a
"WHEN phrase"  than as an "EXTRA phrase."

  While some people have receive no grammatical training during English
lessons, and thus have no framework for their understanding of Glosa, the
necessary grammatical information can be introduced through properly graded
Glosa instruction.  We might be getting there.

*  Hi Sid, 
   This is one way of "doing" interlinguistics.
   Have to admit, it reminds me of the "nonsense sylables" I learnt were
being used to test people's learning ability.
   Actually I am not very intelligent when it comes to memorising 'nonsense
sylables,' so I gave a complete miss to the whole segment of a-priori
designed languages.  I would say that it would be impossible for me to
learn an a-priori language, so I didn't even consider trying.
   I am an example of someone who needs to understand what he is learning:
this translates into my interest in the etymology of words; as long as I
can find a story behind a word - where it came from, what primitive root it
is based on, etc - I can store that word away .. with its story attached.
I guess I might have been pretty dumb had I been shipwrecked off the
Chinese coast, and brought up to remember hundreds of sounds that were
unrelated to their written forms.
   When I was told the story of Glosa, I thought that it could work for me,
because I had come in contact with some of the Classical roots during my
education in Agriculture, and also because of their being a major part of
the history of English.  While I am not good with languages, I do get
letters to the editor, in English, printed in the paper.
   So, yes, everyone has slightly different versions of the language
ability, and I would have been right up against it, were I to have grown up
in a non-Indo-European culture, and tried to learn Glosa.

   Although Glosa's reliance on the Classical roots might be a disadvantage
to those outside the Indo-European tradition, it surely gives a head-start
to people with a European background, or a history of scientific, or
Classical, study.  The 'nonsense sylable' approach to planned languages
gives no-one an advantage, and puts some, like me, at a distinct disadvantage.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

Catty (Charles) are you deranged or do you 
think up these unbelievable accusations
to try getting a reaction out of people?

Obviously you understood none of
the Glosa lines I wrote as an answer
of your other accusatory message.

I haven't trashed any group. As a
matter of fact I support quite a few
auxlang discussion groups and put
forth effort and dedication to the 
study of auxlangs. What this has
to do with religion, I do not really
understand... all I see is a pitiful
attempt at flaming on your part and
a definite show of blind prejudice;
all making a good case that you are
indeed the crackpot and the lunatic
and perhaps it is you who should
be locked up...

Ki! Ki extra, Catty, ki!

Jay raved some more:

> Obviously you understood none of

That's right! Parts resembled your usual Gode-lang rants,
but I don't understand those either. The defect is in your
thoughts, rather than any language you pollute with them.

Continuing:

The problem with Glosa is that it's rough and unfinished,
and doesn't work right linguistically. Most of the other
people participating in this group have grown dissatisfied
with Glosa and want to reform it, the remainder are unable
to write anything comprehensible in it. This includes the
authors, whose samples are/were mere idiomatic relexes that
cannot be understood by non-English speakers. But there is
real merit to the basic idea of using an analytic grammar
with latinate roots, as in the Lingua Franca. Unfortunately
there's no other existing language like that, except Glosa.

(Peano's Interlingua was absorbed into Occidental, which
has many analytic features but still relies on suffixes.)
I use Occ quite a bit for international correspondence, but
would still like to see Glosa reformed and revived to act as
a global interlingua, something acceptable outside Europe.
This doesn't seem the least bit likely to happen, though.
It would require that Wendy appoint a group to carry on
Glosa development, particularly now that she is inactive.

Any language will evolve over time to cover any deficiencies
felt by its speakers in daily use. Glosa could do likewise
with a sufficient community of users; Esperanto accomplished
this to a great extent, adding latinate roots that Zamenhof
(Espo's creator) resisted. I just don't have 100 years to
wait for it to evolve far enough (or 1000 years for Glosa).

It all leaves Glosa nowhere, and this group unusable for a
discussion of possible reforms, because of outside agitators
like the mad-dog Jay, and a few loyal diehards who can't
use it but don't want it changed either.

I believe that those who've put
effort into getting Glosa up on
the web have done an great
job with the resources available.

What have you done for it?

All it takes is a little practice and
some patience and you can pretty
much understand what someone
else writes in Glosa. I do not hold
to the opinion that it is somehow
unusable. It has been used it is in
use and this makes it definitely
usable. 

The lack of grammatical "parts
of speech" (POS) markings in
Glosa means that a definite word
order needs to be followed. Too
much freedom in this regard shows
that we humans depend on this
established sequencing and that
if it isn't there we tend to not 
understand each other well. It's
all a matter of habit. Obviously
people from different language
backgrounds carry grammatical
bagage with them and everytime 
they try learning a new language
their old habits may get in the way.
But consider this... An auxlang
that would be taught to school
children... and this auxlang would
have the graeco-latin roots of 
scientific terminology... well, I 
think this is the kinda goal Wendy
would go for. Endless grammar
discussions and reform move-
ments would not be high on her
list of priorities. So...

The "Problem" _is_ that you want
to reform it so much that it would
be a totally different language. If
so why not make up your own lang
and publish it? Occidental had all 
sorts of reforms, and it is a big lie 
on your part to say that... 
"Peano's Interlingua was absorbed 
into Occidental" 
Not at all! If anything IALA's
Interlingua is a lot closer to Peano's
language than Occidental. Go 
figure where you get all your
raving anger and hate towards
it. The "Problem" is also that
you keep putting Glosa down 
in this list. If you don't like it
then go find a merry pasture

If you're so fond of Occi why
haven't you posted anything
in the Occidental list at Yahoo
Groups? You don't really have
a good command of that either
don't you, just like your Glosa
probably, but that's ok, just
give it some practice bud...
Instead of tearing down build
yourself up, but not at the expense
of putting others down as you
seem so fond of doing.

Since,
Jay B.

I put up some pages that show up on many search engines.
You wouldn't like them because you can't steal them -- CGI.
I like the comment Rick Harrison made on one of his pages
about "let's see how long before [nausialingua] steals this".

It's on the masthead of the Kosmoglot magazines,
approved by old Giuseppe himself. I put up a facsimile
of Kosmo #1 some time ago ... Kosmo allowed discussion
and criticism from all quarters. Decent people do not
try to prevent other's free speech, they welcome it.
You are so ignorant of IAL history.

I don't approve of Bob P's marketing methods. He won't
allow it to breathe. Occ is very flexible and permits
a user to adapt it to circumstances. I have test-driven
Ila vs. Espo vs. Occ with a lot of Spanish-speaking
relatives and friends, and they all hated your Ila.
Some prefer Espo because it's more exotic. Surprising.

> Instead of tearing down build

Jay, if you would stop your ad-hominem attacks and just
reply to points rationally, you wouldn't be such an ass.
Stop following me from group to group and slinging mud.
Better still, just don't read my posts, since you can't
tolerate free exchange of opinions. I have the right to
express myself without an ugly chihuahua biting at my
shoe laces.

Glosa is very close to LF, and could become as successful if
it were cleaned up (vocab roots) and regularized (particles).
The adjective-noun order can be allowed to vary, it doesn't
impede understanding; and verb phrase start/end confusion can
be easily eliminated by use of particles. That's all, but we
currently lack a "political" mechanism to accomplish this.

> Spanish is easier to learn than English,

Only some parts. Overall it's about the same. Why not take
the easiest/best of both? Analytic syntax, latinate roots;
sounds familiar.

That's my thought. Occidental already covers most of that
territory (and in fairness, so does IALA's dictionary),
but Glosa was supposed to reach beyond Europe for its users,
and its simplified CVCV-type words assist in that direction.

How about providing a link

Wrong Catty, the Occidental list
is not Bob P's list, it is you who
are quite ignorant in this regard.

The ad-hominem attacks started
with you Catty.

Look man, I was on this list and
quite a few others before you
came along. Why do you continue
to tell these lies?

You're on, bud from now on you're

Your statement is racist and once
again shows your prejudice. If 
Robin needs reasons to ban you
from this list, your use of foul language
and your racial slurs should be enough.

Good riddance!

It is probably unwise to step into the middle of this epic flamewar between 
Jay and Charles, but if anyone is interested I have started a project to 
design a new language with isolating grammar and "latinate" roots.  So far 
we have a modest Yahoo group and 100 or so messages, most of which are me 
dumping the thoughts I have had over the last couple of years.  Might make 
some light holiday reading:

Let me guess. AUXLANG has bled itself dry, and so its vampires
are now loose, searching for groups to suck the life out of?

And since James can't draw any attention to himself, he can only
follow his idiot brother here to bother me again ... and couldn't
even trouble to devise a new subject line for his spam.

I just looked at your pitiful group, James. Only the same few
idiots and agitators from AUXLANG are there. And you seem to
have gotten bored with it already.

From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com

Around 90% of the world's languages usually place the subject
before the predicate. But only half put the direct object after
the verb. And only half put the noun after the adjective. Among
just the euro-based languages, the proportions remain similar.
So any auxiliary language that chooses (just 1 of the 4 orders),
loses (its claim as a world language).

It is easy to mark the beginning of a verb phrase or direct object
with a particle, which allows their positions to be interchanged
without loss of intelligibility. And swapping the positions of
adjectives and nouns leads to no fatal confusion, even without
adding particles to remove all ambiguity. In fact, most languages
do not maintain a full and separate category for what we call
adjectives in English. (So there is no need for p.o.s. marking.)

This can be easily fixed in Glosa, as long as every verb phrase
is initiated by one of the tense/aspect/mood/voice particles
and every noun phrase begins with an article or preposition.
Also, adverbs of manner (ablatives etc) should be rendered as
prepositional noun phrases, not squeezed into the verb phrase.
Word order is then nearly as flexible as Esperanto, but simpler.

The aim of any auxiliary lang must be maximum ease of learning
with sufficiently powerful expressiveness (not the reverse).
This begins with the alphabet, both spelling and pronunciation.

After a lot of experimentation I keep returning to the same
conclusion, that Glosa has too many sounds and spellings,
owing to its inherited Greek bias. Taking Italian/Spanish as
models for consonant reduction, we can eliminate troublesome
letters (H J K Q W X Y Z) and the more difficult sounds.
The resulting phonology would be very acceptable globally.

There are approx 6000 CVCV roots common to Romance langs
(and most IALs). They can be generated automatically by
an impartial machine algorithm, and re-run to update the
vocabulary as often as desired. Ambiguities are resolved
where possible. (A bit of routine hand-tuning might help,
but we don't need to rely on some great leader's genius.
Instead we can let common collective usage decide matters.)

A pure CVCV vocabulary is better adapted to compounding.
The uniform word-shape is more fluent and dignified.
It lacks the immediate recognizability of longer words
(in Occidental/etc) but has considerable mnemonic value.

Esperanto's severe disfigurement of international roots
and the many silly arbitrary choices of the current vocab
can thus be avoided/repaired. The result seems already
sufficient for real-world use, certainly much improved
versus the current Glosa set (about 33% is identical).

BTW, it turns out that CVC is really insufficient, so the
Ido/Esperanto trick of using p.o.s. final vowels can't work.
CVCVC gives slightly nicer roots (e.g. FELIN vs GATO) but
seems too heavy and invites suffixation. And adding more
consonants (e.g. H J) yields very few roots while excluding
very many people who can't pronounce or distinguish them.

Only the minimum necessary grammatical apparatus can be
sufficiently simple for adults to learn in their limited
free time. Fewer than 100 particles are needed for a
workable analytical language, so they can and should
all follow a CV pattern, distinguishing them from the
CVCV roots at a glance. They mark off phrase boundaries
and together with a few sentence patterns (syntax rules)
they can essentially implement the whole grammar, without
resorting to painful nonsense like "parts of speech".

Glosa's set of particles is unacceptable and incomplete.
They need to be selected from the natural source languages
rather than invented; no language inventor is more ingenious
than the hundreds of millions who together evolved the
Romance languages during 2 millenia of real life. All the
necessary particles are well-known to linguists, who have
described the same or similar functions in nearly every
language yet discovered. We just need to collect them.

I don't have an algorithm for that, though -- and not
knowing Greek Latin etc, I can't make the selections.
Maybe a pidgin stage would help to sort them out.

End of suggestions. Happy New Year, brave new world.
