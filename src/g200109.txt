Very good news:  Wendy gave me permission to publish her book "18 Steps
to Fluency in Euro-Glosa" on the web.  And so I did, please visit 

  http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm 

(190 kB HTML and about 185 kB GIF).  A German version is under
construction: 

  http://www.glosa.org/dt/g18s.htm 

Before, Glosa had no real description and no good learning material in 
the internet.  So this is a step forward, I think.  

Perhaps it is strange, but remarkable, that the Glosa authors did 
not present their language in a theoretical grammar book or a somehow 
scientific work, but in form of a children's school book. 

Here is my foreword: 

"This HTML-file is a light version of the book

  Ashby, Wendy/ Clark, Ronald: 
  18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa, 
  The Interlanguage for Europe and the World, 
  3rd edition (c) 1992 by Glosa Education Organizaton, 
  Richmond, UK; ISBN 0 946540 15 2. 

You can buy the book from Wendy Ashby (c/o Glosa Education 
Organization, P. O. Box 18, Richmond Surrey TW9 2GE, England). 
With its price of 8.95 GBpound you would supply Glosa development and 
spreading. 

This file is not the whole book, and does not want to be.  
Though all sample sentences and all roules are contained, only
Step 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, 13, 16, 17 and 18 are really complete.  
The Glosa 1000 vocabulary list is missing, please refer to the 
  Glosa Internet Dictionary ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/index.html ). 
This version is meant only as a supplement of Glosa's presentation in 
the internet. 

>From the book itself and a letter I got from Wendy Ashby, I have 
the feeling, that this book is meant as THE OFFICIAL description 
of Glosa. 
  
Please report errors to marcel{at}glosa{dot}org !  Thank you.

Ok, I will probably use Internet, as a proper noun, as if
it were the name of a foreign country.

I was trying to convey the sense that you are acting on
some stuff. What about fa-apo, etc.? Or do you think that
apo, kopi, moti, and destru can stand alone?

>  > "redo" - re-akti? 
>

Yes, that is probably better.

> "print out"             - printa ex 

Printa is not a core word, so I prefer tipo.

> "format a disk"         - format u diska 

Format doesn't seem to be a word at all, so I would
probably try prepara or struktura (or struktura-akti).

> "open up a file"        - apri u dosie 

The dictionaries all have aperi, not apri. Dosie isn't in
any word list, although it sounds ok. 

There seem to be several words in the "18 steps" that
aren't in the other lists, which is a bit disturbing. Are
there plans to update the lists to match the 18 steps, or
vice versa?

I'll probably put up a technology word list, with my
preferences, "official" words, and other possibilities.

Kevin

It does not fit the "native phonology" (word-shape) of Glosa.
Most IALs are using "inter-rete" or variations.

It wold be so much better if Wendy would clearly describe
the rules for word-formation rather than present a mere
word-list as the canonical work. I think the rules are
described, in a scattered way, but are inconsistent.

How is "o" pronounced in Glosa?

My first guess was that it is like an American would
pronounce the O in OK, or go.

However, somewhere I read that it should be more of an "or"
sound.

In another document, it referred to prouncing it like AW,
but since that document was probably from the UK, I really
don't know what that means. Is that like the ow sound in
couch?

Like in Spanish, Italian (most dialects), Swahili, Japanese.

The problem for non-linguists is that British English often
uses /eu/ diphthong for /o/ instead of the "pure" O vowel.
Americans use /ou/, also not quite right, needs clipping.
But since there are only 5 Glosa vowels, anybody can make a
good enough approximation. Just spread them out (dissimilate).
It's *supposed* to be easy, by design ...

Assuming you speak with my accent, words like "bought" and
"boat" straddle the boundaries of a theoretically meticulous
Glosa O, and it's pretty nearly the same with most other
Euro-style IALs like Esperanto and Ido etc. But an L.A.
accent rhymes "bought" with "bot", more like Glosa A,
so one must specify which dialect is used.

New Jerseyan to Glosa vowel mapping:
A: as in "bat" or "bot" (not "bad")
E:       "bet" or "bait" (not "beat")
I:       "bit" or "beat" (not "bite")
O:    "bought" or "boat" (not "bot")
U:      "book" or "boot" (not "but")

BTW, "bot" is Modern Cyber English for "robot".

Ok, that helps.

I found this pretty amusing, as a life-long west-coaster. 

I say "bat" and "bad" the same way, but "bot" works for me
for "a".

"Bit" doesn't seem to belong, as it seems halfway between
the Glosa "e" and "i" to me. "Beat" works for "i".

I say "bought" and "bot" the same way, so "boat" is my cue
for "o".

Not sure about "book", but I like "boot" for "u".

Thanks,

Kevin

Yes, we should do that. 

The biggest part of the "18 Steps" book contains word lists.  A lot of 
them are missing in the internet version, because (I was lazy and) I 
thought, a dictionary would be a better place for them. 

"18 Steps" has got a lot of special words (household, apiculture), 
that are not in the Dictionary yet and that are worth a research and 
supplement to the Internet Dictionary.  

We could write a program (with "grep" or whatever), that compares my 
HTML-file ( http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm ) with the Glosa Internet 
Dictionary ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/glen.txt ).  So we could 
identify words not yet in the dictionary.  And we can supplement new 
meanings. 

With the same program we could research in texts of the newspaper 
"Plu Glosa Nota".  Then we would get official Glosa words not yet in 
any dictionary.  Because "Plu Glosa Nota" is a lot of material 
(85 issues so far), covering a lot of topics, we would get a 
vocabulary, that is quite ripe.  Ripe, because it is not made by 
construction but by use in texts and communication, so a little 
"natural". 

My impression is, that "18 Steps" is OLDER (mainly 1985) than most of 
the word lists (mainly early 90ies).  So the GID is to be prefered.  
Certainly "18 Steps" would need an update, but I do not believe that 
we ever get it, because its author has died.  Nevertheless, the 
additional words and meanings should be collected.

    I was looking back over some old files, and I came across this post
by Charles.  Despite the time lapse, I decided to offer a thought or
two.

On Mon, 27 Aug 2001, Charles wrote:

    I do not agree and have previously expressed my opinion that all I
think Glosa really needs is an agreed-upon, adequate (whatever that
turns out to be) vocabulary.  If it were not already workable, I could
not have exchanged two letters each way with a man in China who said
that he knew little English, and I know no Chinese.

    Now I agree that Glosa has at least very little (in relative terms)
user base to lose.  But I simply cannot agree that it is in a "reform
or die" condition.  It might disappear, but not because of any
intrinsic adequacy that I can see (if the standardized vocabulary
matter can be addressed).  In the end, linguistic characteristics are
only *one* factor relating to whether or not some auxiliary language
succeeds (in relative terms), and not the most important factor at
that.  Just look at Esperanto, or, even more to the point, English. 
Who in his right mind :-) would deliberately *construct* something like
English as an international auxiliary language and expect to be taken
seriously?  And yet English is the most successful international
auxiliary language the world has ever known -- it just isn't a
constructed one.

    In my essay "Thoughts on IAL Success" on my web site, I discuss
seven factors relating to why an IAL might or might not succeed.  One
of those, and the only one really addressing linguistic characteristics
as such, is "Good Enough."  For heaven's sake, if *English* (!) is the
world's most successful IAL ever, and if Tok Pisin (New Guinea Pidgin
English) can be used in parliamentary debates (so I have read), then
structurally Glosa works.

Having said what I did, I wouldn't want to merely rehash it now,
though obviously we have each failed to convince the other.
But I can add one point, namely that I spent several years
trying many of the well-known and some lesser-known IALS,
and they certainly vary greatly in perceived effectiveness.
Failure to distinguish significant differences is an indictment
of the whole lot of IALs, whose purpose is to provide a *better*
solution than "just learn English", or (worse) "lernu Esperanton".

    I think it must somehow be your AOL settings, because I
have seen a lot of mail from many other AOL subscribers and
their text shows up in the body, not as attachments.

Glossa seams to be very easy: English is english and Spain is Spain.
Harder then for us who are not native speakers of English.

Here, I confess that I've taken an English shortcut. This
is a problem with any language, of course. "German" is our
English name for that language, and not the Deutscher (?)
word for it.

>From the "18 Steps" document:

"Language name = name of country + lingua; or you can use
the native name. Eg. England-lingua or English."

I guess it would be English and Espana-lingua (?). Not sure
about China. But in "18 Steps" they sometimes use "France"
instead of "Francais". 

Of course we also have problems because Glosa doesn't have
an n with a tilde, nor the modified c used in French. And,
of course, that is also a common problem between languages.

Perhaps someone more expert in Glosa could clarify this. Is
there a list of common country and language names in Glosa?

Kevin

Tsunkuo (Bad spelling!) would be good for China.

France is the country and Francais(e) is the adjective.
France-lingua it would be.

Sverige and Sverige-lingua then for Sweden and Suomi - Suomilingua for
country and language. Sverige-pe would be a Swedish person like myself.
Right?

Sounds good to me. I'm starting a list of Glosa country
names, so I've added those.

Question for Glosa experts: Is it true that the Glosa word
should *look* rather than *sound* as much like the native
word as possible? That is, would it be Espana instead of 
Espania? Canada instead of Kanada?

I would say:
 - Normal words phonetical,
 - but names look and sound as in their original language.
 - By languages, that do not use the Latin alphabet:
     ---> Try to find the original name and put it into
          Glosa-phonetical letters (Greece becomes "Helas").
          Or use the English name, speak it Italian and put that into
          Glosa-phonetical letters (China becomes "Cina").
 - Names start always with capital letters.

Exsamples:
 - Spain, write "España" and speak "Espanja". "España-lingua",
   "Español".  Only, if no n-tilde available, write "Espanjol".
 - "France-lingua" (speak "Frons-lingua") or "Français" (speak
   "Fronsei") for French
 - "German" in German "deutsch" (small letter), in Glosa "Deutsch",
   speak "Doec".
 - write "Canada" and speak "Kanada".

Now, only one problem is left ...

... but it is not so big, I think: - countries with more than one
language.  So "Suomi" (Finnish) and "Finland" (Swedish) should be
correct.  Similar "Belgique" (French, speak "Belscik") and "Belge"
(Flemish), "Suisse" (French), "Schweitz" (German, speak "Scvaits")
and "Svizzera" (Italian).

Depends. Suomi is Finland and Finnish. Sverige is Sweden and svensk is
Swedish.

I can well understand that a world language cannot trouble itself with
such small countries ;-). Problem will be how to pronounce.

Mostly people pronounce _sverye_ (the first e is as è in French and
Italian) the y as Englesy yes, v as in victory.

Wishing Success in your Glosa development!

You are still posting ATTACHMENTS instead of PLAIN ASCII TEXT.

The freeuk message came through normally.  The message from 
AOL is still coming through as attachments.

Yes. freeuk came through fine. I would not recommend "AOL".

From: hzi{at}uol{dot}com{dot}br
Date: Sun, 23 Sep 2001 11:21:12 -0300

Hello-

	I'm sorry that I have to write this in English, this is my
third day of Glosa.
	
	I would like o express the opinion here, that ** all **
materials must be downloaded. The concept that someone will make money
out of an international language is outrageous.
	It will never truly be a candidate for a srong IAL if things
are sold.
	
	I think you have to garantee that the material is not
copyrighted by someone else, though.

	Are you familiar with the GNU/Linux computer distribution? These
guys have come up with a way to make the only operating system that
even threatens Microsoft. They way it's done is that key things in a
GNU/Linux operating system cannot be "sold". They can be distributed,
though.
	The GNU/Linux distribution I use is the Debian GNU/Linux. It
is a non-profit organization, made up of hundreds of international
volunteers that are in the computer industry. They don't make any
money out of it. You can download the whole operating system for free,
if you want. If, however, for your convenience, you shouold choose to
buy a CD-ROM, it's ok. All that will be charged is the fact that I
made the CD-ROM and mailed it to you. Our reward is the development of
a better product which we ourselves use. We think we've come up with
one of the best solutions in the market, although we remain ** outside
** the market. We think we're better than Microsoft, and we don't care
if people believe it or not. We don't even care if they use Debian or
not. We do. (No entirely true - we care in a political sense - we
think too many governments waste money on products, when they could be
using Free Software).

	Likewise, I think Glosa6000 material should be freely
downloadable. If people want to buy a book, there should be that
option too. But ** having ** to buy Glosa6000 is going to hinder the
progress.

	Do you think all people the remote corners of the world have a
credit card? Just now, governments in the Third World are setting up
free internet access.

	I'm interested in Glosa because the Debian GNU/Linux
distribution has been translated to some 80-plus languages. It is
possibly the only distribution that has achieved this, since we're not
market-oriented, but quality-oriented. As you can imagine, I think
interaction between our software developers could be greatly augmented
by the adoption of an IAL. 

	I found Esperanto difficult, even though Portuguese is my
native language. I also read Spanish, Italian, French, and I am now
studying German. As soon as I laid my eye on Glosa, I was able to
understand, or sort out, what was written. Esperanto is not like this
at all. Interlingua is too biased towards the languages I already
speak. As I've said, many of the languages in the Debian distribution
are non-western.

	The Debian linux community I believe, will eventually come to
the realisation that an IAL is vital necessity for the way we develop
software. 

	From what I've seen, you might have to change a few things,
like one having o ** buy ** Glosa6000. I mean, you're entitled to sell
a book, because you put effort into it. But if that's the only source
of Glosa6000, and ** there isn't anyother available ** from a link at
www.glosa.org, than you're not ever going to succeed. Which would be
rather unfortunate for the whole of us, since Glosa seems to be such
an excellent choice.


	Regards,

	Henry

I am a very bad glosa-pe myself and have not been able to learn the
language, but in the IAL-market perhaps this is a good way in promoting
Glosa, allthough I am very doubtful of bot the way it has been promoted and
the language itself.

There are those who think that people should pay for what they get. Then you
will have to create the motivation necessary. I doubt Glosa can manage that.

 If your payment is the product itself, and the benefits derived from
 the widespread use of it, then I think it's more than paid for.

 That's why I mentioned the Linux community.
 More than 60% of the computers serving the web pages you see run on
 Free Software (the Apache server). I am not talking of home PCs, but
 the infra-structure behind them, which you do not see.

 This is a perfect example.

 I feel people will not join Glosa if they feel someone's making a
 profit with it, all the while saying that it's "a language for the
 world".

 We'll all have to stick with Esperanto, if it's like that...

 Regards,

 Henry

Everybody interested in Glosa writes in English, for several reasons.
If you hang around long enough you will come to understand why.

Anything that requires work to produce, requires payment for the worker,
directly or indirectly.

Nobody forces you to buy the book. Pick it up by just using it
with others (if you can find any). Some other IALs work that way.
Use "international vocabulary", which Wendy referred to somewhere.

Now, that's a cool idea ... but I think English will have to do.
No IAL is so easy that it can be picked up without some effort
and a lot of continual practice, so programmers won't do it --
we'd prefer to engineer our own new interlingua-protocol.

If more people had such great language skills as you do, there would be
no need for any IAL. Are you saying all you need is a vocab list and
then you could handle Glosa? That is available, see Marcel's web pages.

I agree that all the fundamental materials must be freely
available (and have said so in the past). And, in fact, the
online word lists seem to have at least 6000 words, so I
believe everything you need is available for free.
(Although I don't know if Glosa 6000 is more than just a
word list).

One of the most important tools to spread Glosa is having
more text IN Glosa. That's why I'm translating my website
to Glosa(www.qualitycode.com). We can sit around reading

I don't understand your problem. Everyone can easy download Glosa Internet
Dictionary (which includes all words from G6000) from glosa.org. Maybe you
just didn't find it?

Please take the Glosa Internet Dictionary 
(GID, http://www.glosa.org/gid ).  

The vocabulary list of the book "Glosa 6000" is completely included! 
So you have free access to the words without been forced to spend 
money for a paper version. 

And: 
 - GID provides all Central words (Glosa 1000), "Glosa 6000" does not. 
 - GID provides both directions (Glosa-English AND E-G), and this 
     without contradictions.  6000 has only G-E.  
 - Typing errors of the book are removed. 
 - (for Linux-fans:) Several people all over the world have worked on 
     the GID via internet.

Ok, that wasn't so good...I meant: I think this should be better
explained in the glosa home page.

Thanks!

Interesting. In my own writing, the Basic Reference has
often had better word selections than the core.

I'm curious about the chronology and relationships between:
G1000
G6000
GID full
GID core
Basic Reference
18 steps

Which are newest? Oldest? Which were derived from which
others? What are the credentials of the GID core that put
it on top?

My goal is to have a word list for my own use, which is a
good subset of standard Glosa dictionaries. If other people
choose to use it, that's fine, but it's really for me. I
almost created my own word in one case [1], but ended up
sticking entirely to existing words.

I don't like having multiple words with the same meaning,
so I'm removing all exact duplication. At the same time,
I'm omitting some words that don't belong in a "core" list,
and adding others that I need on a regular basis, or feel
would be important in daily use (like sink, chair, shovel,
important, "ke", etc.)

I've put my list into a standard-format data file that will
allow me to automatically generate lists sorted three ways:
English-Glosa
Glosa-English
Categorized

I've created a bunch of categories, like "animals" and
"time", which really helped me detect duplications. I've
also annotated all changes from the original Basic
Reference, so people will know what I added, removed, or
changed.

Anyway, it's a fun project.

Kevin

[1] besboli really bothers me. It has neither of the roots
for "base" nor "ball". I had basbola in my list for a bit,
but then realized that it was the only professional sport
in the list, which seemed out of place. So I just removed
besboli instead. As long as I don't have to look at it, it
won't bother me.

Why does Glosa have a word "citri" for lemon, but none for
lime? Also, is "orange" the color or fruit? It shouldn't
mean both.

Do I need to write "orange frukti" and "orange citri"? Or
use orange for the fruit, and write "ruby xanto" for the
color?

"Tilia" means lime tree, but which word means lime fruit?
Perhaps "kloro-citri"?

I want to try an answer.

G1000 (1972 ... 1992):
  Is the 'heart of Glosa'.  The words that should be prefered. 
  But unfortunately there are several lists of G1000 contradicting 
  each other. 

G6000 (1983, 1985, 1992): 
  Some Glosa-pe complained, that 1000 words are too few.  So Ron Clark 
  wrote the G6000-book.  
  Unfortunately, G1000 is not completely included. And it does not 
  really increase the expressivity of Glosa, because there are a lot 
  of synonyms to G1000 words in it.  It also has typing errors and 
  ending vowel confusions.

  So we needed a list, that contains all words, a list, that preferes 
  G1000, but that is supplemented by the words of G6000, which are 
  really valuable because they are not synonyms to G1000 words.  That 
  is what the GID tries. 

Basic Reference (1996): 
  is an Internet version of G1000 by Paul Bartlett.  Paul recognized 
  some lacks of G1000 and so he made some little changes/additions. 

18 steps (1985, 1989, 1992): 
  - a short version of it is http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm - 
  is a learning book.  Its sections (steps) have vocabulary lists with 
  some very special words that are in no other list (e.g. sito-api - 
  forager bee). 
  At the end of the book, there are two G1000 lists, G-E and E-G, 
  unfortunately contradicting each other again. 

GID full (1998-2001): 
  Several people all over the world have worked on this list. 
  It is a combination of several word lists.  G6000, English5000 to 
  G1000 of the book Central Glosa (1993) and G-E of 18 Steps are 
  completely included. 
  But of course, there is a lot of work to do yet. 

GID core (1998-2001): 
  is a subset of GID full, and this time without contradictions, 
  because it is generated by a computer program. 
  It is a suggestion, which words should be prefered.  
  The words are elected that way, that their English meanings cover 
  possibly the most part of three scientifical lists of most often 
  used and most essential English words. 
  The words are nearly all G1000.  So GID Core is quite close to the 
  authors's Glosa.

Certainly not! There are other solutions that you can find on the web. And you can
argue that in order to spread a language you will be able to make money from it.

It is a legitimate thing, I think. Then it is an other thing that I don't think
Glosa has the power to attract people as is, and I don't think that the fact that
you have to pay for it makes it easier.

Det skulle nog inte funka om jag skrev på svenska... ;-)

There is a paradox here: I don't think it would be kindly looked upon if I
wrote in some other IALs I know. This is a good example showing that even a
national language can be in some way neutral!

Are there no libraries you could go to and borrow the book? Then you read it
and take notes...

In un tal caso on pote scriber in Interlingua o ben in Occidental, linguas
que es a prime vista comprensibile a multe personas. Alcunos prefere
interlingua, que es simple pro illes, alteres pensa que Occidental es plus
facile. Isto non es un problema, viste que como parlator de interlingua io
lege occidental sin difficultate (e comprende lo!) ;-)

Is there any way for me to get the raw data files? I would
love to use them to see how close my core list is to GID
core. Perhaps you could put a link in the "Word Kitchen"
section of the site? I would also be interested in hearing
more about any software you use to manipulate the word
lists.

I would like to cross-compare my list with the GID core. It
should be pretty close already.

Sorry, I don't understand but that looks like a good start for an IAL.
We will just make a few little changes ... Just joking.

I had a strange experience on the alt.language.artificial newsgroup:
After recommending some interesting linguistics paper, there were
replies from English speakers complaining about the elevated vocabulary
used in science, that it wasn't real English. That kind of stupidity
was unexpected among people interested in language engineering! Also,
once again, on sci.lang there is verbal combat against Esperanto.
Maybe the English-speakers have lost their desire to usa *any* IAL
since the outbreak of terrorism. Some few may still believe that
Latin roots are the proper base for an IAL, but we aren't winning.

The source file is www.glosa.org/gid/glen.txt .  The "software" is 
quite unspectacular.  4 little routines, 12 kB all, gcc.

    Yes.  Everything is still coming through as attachments, just as

*   While I did find difficulties, particularly with checking both ends to see if the translation was present - so I would know a reader was able to find the meaning of the Glosa word I used, I definitely felt a lot happier with the flexibility offerred by the larger list.


    However, having said that, I recognise the absolute need for an unambiguous, all-inclusive GID, and encourage its completion.


    While putting the lexicon into shape, I feel, also, that we should - at the same time - be taking the language out of the garage, and giving it a run around the block a couple of time, periodically.

    To this end I suggest the compilation of a book of children's stories - in Glosa, of course.

This raises an interesting question. Earlier, the response
was that countries should be spelled as they are in the
native language. Which makes sense for written
communication.

But here Sydney is proposing the approach taken by many
other languages, which is to spell countries phonetically
as they are spoken in the native language. Which makes
sense for oral communication. It also avoids issues with
alternate character sets, which is (in my mind)
significant.

Am I missing some major advantage of the former approach?
Is it better because Glosa is expected to be used more for
writing than for speaking?

Kevin

... "18 Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa" ...
... http://www.glosa.org/en/g18s.htm ...
... I got corrections from Nick Hempshall ...

I was very happy, that Nick - as an English man - had problems with
"kemi-bo" (="chemist's", Nick suggested "medika-ma-bo" or "farmako-bo")
and "kloro-bo" (="green grocer's", Nick suggested "sito-fito-bo"),
too.

I did not like some other things in the "18 Steps", because my native
language is not English.  I would rather hear some comments from you
about them:

-----------------------------------------

p. 11:
Pend id epi mura
- Hang it on the wall
- Häng es an die Wand
 ---> Mi sio ma amo "ad mura" (cf. adhesive)

p. 11:
skope u programa epi TV
- Watch a program on TV
- eine Sendung im Fernsehen sehen
 ---> Mi sio ma amo "in TV".  (Tu pote loka u flori-vasa "epi" TV-me.)
      Mali-fortuna, English "program" eqa Deutsch "Sendung" e Deutsch
      "Programm" eqa English "channel".

p. 19:
Siniora. Siniorina (Sa.)
- Mrs. Miss (Ms)
- Frau. Fräulein
 ---> Qe "Sa." es brevi verba pro "Siniora" alo "Siniorina"?
      Mi sio amo simpli "andro" vice "Sinior" e "gina" vice "Siniora"
      e (!) "Siniorina".
      U Deutsch verba "Fräulein" (="pusi gina") es paleo e ne ge-amo.

p. 19:
A tu sinceri
- Yours sincerely
 ---> Mi sio ma amo solo "Saluta".
      (German commercial letters have only two possible greetings:
      friendly "Mit freundlichen Grüßen", and (perhaps a little less
      friendly) "Mit freundlichem Gruß".  All others are
      old-fashioned and should not be used any longer.)

p. 49:
Note: When 'who' or 'which' are the object of a clause they
are usually left out in English.  In Glosa we always leave them out.
Instead of saying; "The man WHOM I saw yesterday" we say "The man I
saw yesterday".
 ---> This rule is bad for an IAL.
      It is not only superfluous, but means an irregularity and,
      because it is an English phenomenon, it attacks Glosa's
      neutrality.
        "Un andro; mi pa vide qi pa-di."
      And very important: ";"!

Those are not even general English idioms, but ones peculiar to England.
Of course they should be corrected.

That looks like a "causative" construction. I can't believe
it would seem natural to most non-English non-Germans. Better
would be "you make hang the object preposition somewhere".
Which preposition is used doesn't matter so much, "ad/at" is
most general but "on" must be allowed too.

> skope u programa epi TV

I'd use "de" certainly. My cats watch from "on" the tv (monitor).

A world language needs an honorific but it should not be sexist.
Unfortunately the Japanese "san" won't work as a preposition ...
Use of abbreviations should be avoided also.

> A tu sinceri

A postposed adverb is an atrocity. Should be "con sinceri" or like that.

Glosa does not have a workable relative clause structure.
The semicoloned syntax is ridiculous. I would suggest using
"que/ke" for both animate and inanimate references, and add
a resumptive particle instead of relying on the more complex
syntax of gapped constructions. But what to use for the RP?

un  andro ke  mi pa  vide RP   in pa-di    ...
the man   who I  did see  such in past-day ...

I could also see "tu du nexi id a mura" or something like
that.

Or perhaps "in". I suppose it would be "epi skuta", though.

Why does there need to be anything where the RP is? Isn't
it already unambiguous? I feel like I'm missing something.

English uses the "gap" method, many other languages use a
"resumptive pronoun". In brief, the gap method is inferior.
The best URL (AFAIK) discussing these syntax issues is:

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 29 Sep 2001 22:08:35 -0700 (PDT)

I'm putting together my own updated Glosa/English core word
list, and I'm having trouble with several specific word
meanings. 

Each entry below has the Glosa word in question, the
English word that appears in the GID as a meaning, and my
question.

My goal is to have (relatively) unambigous links between
specific Glosa and English words. I want to provide
guidance as to why you might choose this translation over
that one, and eliminate any Glosa words from my list that
aren't provding real value. 

Some of my questions may seem really picky. In some cases,
the word might currently have two meanings for historical
reasons, but my goal is to try to distinguish between the
two, and point to a
different word.

I think it's important for an IAL to eliminate as much
ambiguity as possible. This means avoiding disparate
meanings for the same word.

ANY help would be greatly appreciated!

bato;deep (?), depth (?);
Is this physical depth only, or "profoundness" also?

bulbo;bulb (?);
Is this a plant seed like a tulip bulb? Or a shape like a
light bulb or bulbous nose?

decimali;decimal (?);
Is this an adjective? Or is it a decimal point? Or
something else? Why not use dek... instead of dec...?

delega;delegate (to?)
Is this transative or intransative? Is it to-delegate, or
be-a-delegate?

dirigi;direct (?);
I assume this is more like straight, and less like guide or
steer.

diskusi;conference (?)
Is this like a parent-teacher conference (huddle)? Or like
an international meeting?

figura;figure (?);
I'm guessing this is a noun, meaning something like a
shape, and not the verb to calculate.

fonda;background (?)
Is this like a visual backdrop? Or like foundational
background information?

hedo;fun (?)
ludo;fun (?)
How would you describe when "fun" is more like hedo, and
when it is more like ludo? Could I just remove it from
hedo?

idio;private (?);
Most of the meanings of idio have to do with identity and
uniqueness. How can it also mean private?

imagi;image (?);
Is this a physical image? Conceptual image? Any oft hose?
Imagina already takes care of imagination (mental image).

kompani;company (?);
Is this a business? Or like having company come to visit?
Or like a company of soldiers?

koncentra;concentrate (?);
Is this mental focus, or the physical opposite of dilute?
Perhaps in this case it is reasonable to mean both.

koncerne;concern (?);
Is this like "to worry", or "related-to"?

kontenta;content (?), constituent;
This seems like it would be the contents of something, like
a packing list, as opposed to being happy and content.

korka;cork (?);
Should I focus on the material (like a cork-board), or the
bottle-stopper (that might be plastic)?

kredito;credit (?);
Is this financial credit? Or respect for a job well done?

limita;rather (?);
Most of the meanings are limit, bound, frontier, etc. How
did "rather" get in this list?

liqi;fuse (?);
I assume this is like welding or soldering--fusing together
_by liquifying_, right?

lisi;smooth (?);
The other definitions are separate and isolate, so smooth
seems really out of place. I would think glisa would be
better for smooth.

orange;orange
I asked before, but is this the color or the fruit. I'm
leaning towards the fruit (since that seems to be the
original source of the word), which would make the color
ruby-xanto. Ok?

Kevin

  This has to do with depth, as in a "bathysphere", and not profound,
  as in "De profundis".

  Seed. A light bulb is somewhat seed-ahaped, is't it?

  A "decimal" in Portuguese is a number with a decimal point; not a
  whole number and not expressed as a fraction.

  "Dirigir" (Port.) [a car]. Dirigir as negociações (Steer, maneuver
  the negotiations). Guide or steer, or drive [as in car]. At least
  those would be my options. I believe someone speaking French would
  agree.

  Whe we say "conference" in Portuguese, or when I read it in French,
  Spanish, or Italian, it's that designates a situation more like an
  international meeting. It is more formal, and more important.
  It may also mean a "speech", or "lecture", or "presentation", as in
  a medical congress, or an academic lecture.

  It designates shape, no doubt about that. "Calculate" = "calcular"
  (Port., Span.), "calculer" (Fr.), "calculare" (Ital.)

  Both, depending on the context.

  Ludo, IMMO, is probably more "child-like", as in "to play". It has
  do more with the imagination, or the creative mind or moment.
  Hedo is more "sensual", or having to with the five senses: the
  "hedonists", those that are adept of carnal pleasures.

  Take "identity": you have you __own__ identity, you have a unique
  face, and life history. It [this identidy]  doesn't belong
  to anyone but yourself. Therefore, it's also "private" in the sense
  of "1. of, belonging to, or concerning a particular person or groups
  of persons; not common or general; as __private__ property." Not in
  the sense of "5. not known to the public; secret; confidential; as
  in one's __private__ opinion".
  The above definitions are from Webster's Unabridged Dictionary, 2nd
  ed.

  Both. A mental image, a picture (physical or in the mind's eye), or
  a reputation.

  All three, I feel, would be correct.

  Both.

  Both.

  To be happy is to be full of the quality, or feeling, of Happiness,
  right? So, as you can see, there's logic to both propsitions:
  content=happy, or content=contents.
  However, in Portuguese there's a difference between "contente"
  [happy and content] and "conteúdo" [contents].
  If kontenta is the root word then I feel it must mean both, since
  it had not evolved to the different, and more specific, forms.

  Since there was no plastic around in Acient Rome or Greece, to make

  "korka plastica".

  Sounds logical, but I can't think at the moment, of an example in a
  latin language.

  Smooth, IMHO.

  Don't know. When did the word "orange" come up. What do our
  phylologists here say? "Xanto" is greek, so it's old. Is "orange"
  Neo-Latin, or is it present in Latin texts?

My thoughts relating to Kevin Smith's questions.

A word in Glosa is intended to stand for only one
concept. But this concept may be represented in
English by a large number of words, and remember 
a Glosa word can act in any part of speech category.
A metaphorical usage must also be allowed.
 
> bato;deep (?), depth (?);
> Is this physical depth only, or "profoundness" also?

Physical depth is the intended meaning.

> bulbo;bulb (?);
> Is this a plant seed like a tulip bulb? Or a shape like a
> light bulb or bulbous nose?

Any swollen onion-shaped object .

> decimali;decimal (?);

No fixed assignment to part of speech categories in Glosa!
The name of the base 10 system of counting.
Decimal point is "koma" (",").

C/K: My guess is the Latin "CI" tends to remain "CI" in Glosa.
 
> delega;delegate (to?)

> be-a-delegate?

I have ~delegati~.
It appears to me to be the action of giving a job to 
someone to do on your behalf. That makes the 
person doing the job a "ge-delegati-pe".

> dirigi;direct (?);

> steer.

I have ~direkti~ as the preferred form. Both mean guide/steer.
Straight would be ~rekti~.

> diskusi;conference (?)

> an international meeting?

Any kind of discussion.
 
> figura;figure (?);

A shape.
Calculate is ~kalkula~.
Figure out (think) is ~puta~.

> background information?

Explanatory info. 

> hedo;fun (?)
> ludo;fun (?)
> How would you describe when "fun" is more like hedo, and
> when it is more like ludo? Could I just remove it from
> hedo?

~Hedo~ is pleasure or happiness and ~ludo~ is playing or a game.
So it depends on what you are doing for fun.

> idio;private (?);

> uniqueness. How can it also mean private?

Private in the sense of personal, not public.

> imagi;image (?);
> Is this a physical image? Conceptual image? Any oft hose?
> Imagina already takes care of imagination (mental image).

A physical likeness.

> kompani;company (?);
> Is this a business? Or like having company come to visit?
> Or like a company of soldiers?

Business.
"Company come to visit" ~hospi~
Company of soldiers would be ~grega~.

> koncentra;concentrate (?);
> Is this mental focus, or the physical opposite of dilute?
> Perhaps in this case it is reasonable to mean both.

Focus mental activity, time or resources on something.
~Apo aqa~ remove water.

> koncerne;concern (?);
> Is this like "to worry", or "related-to"?

Worry is ~turba~. 
Related-to is ~de~. 
~Gravi pro~ is to matter/be concerned about.

> kontenta;content (?), constituent;
> This seems like it would be the contents of something, like
> a packing list, as opposed to being happy and content.

Contents are ~plu in-ra~.
Content is ~ge-place~ [pleased].
Constituent is ~mero-ma~

> korka;cork (?);
> Should I focus on the material (like a cork-board), or the
> bottle-stopper (that might be plastic)?

Material.

> kredito;credit (?);
> Is this financial credit? Or respect for a job well done?

Finance

> limita;rather (?);

> did "rather" get in this list?

Rather in the sense of "somewhat" / "to some extent or degree".
 
> liqi;fuse (?);

Yes, or fusing "apart" (melting) as an electrical fuse does.

Yes, the G seems to have got separated from the rest of
the word. ~Glisa~ is slip, slide. Smooth is ~glabro~.

Fruit

13th century. Via Old French pomme d'orenge, a translation (influenced by
Orange, a town in France) of Italian melarancia 'orange fruit', via Arabic
naranj and Persian narang from Sanskrit narangah .
