Tom Croft grafo (mero):
> There is not a law under which     
> es na u nomi infra qi 

~na~ is we/us/our in Glosa  guess this is just your
tired fingers playing tricks.

If liked, this there is ~il~, but this is not
required.

is not a law is ~ne es u nomi~ or this could be 
there is no law ~Es zero nomi or Es nuli nomi

This is where the semicolon comes in to mark the
beginning of the new clause. Often this is marked in
English by the word that which is omitted in
official Glosa (unofficially it is ~ke~). The
semicolon also marks the end of the clause, if there
is a return to the original main clause, which very
often there isnt, as in these sentences.

** Es zero nomi;

under this is probably by means of ~per~


> any part of this universe is	   
> ali-mero de u-ci universa es 

> governed that does not come	   
> regula; qi na implika 

is governed /is organised  this is a passive
construction so ~gene regula~.

that is covered by the semicolon.

** ali-mero de u-ci universa gene regula per; 

> into play in the phenomena of

> the chemical history of a

> candle.  There is no better	   
> kandela. es na ma-boni 

** u kemi histori de kandela ne gene implika.

** Ne es u ma-boni

> door by which you can enter	   
> mode a ki ad-in 

to enter would be ~de ki~ of entering
to begin ~de proto~

> into the study of natural
> u studi de skience 

** mode de proto u stude de skience

> philosophy than by considering
> hetero de kura puta


> the physical phenomena of a
> u reali feno de u   

physical phenomena ~plu fisika akti~

For me ~feno~ is more for things that are not real, 
where as phenomena is the behaviour.

~u reali feno~ the real appearance = the true
nature?

~de u~ - ~u~ is normally omitted after a preposition.

Also sometimes ~plu~
a herd of cows = ~u grega de bovi~ 
[~plu~ omitted because ~grega~ tells you it is
plural.]


> candle.
> kandela.

** hetero de kura puta de plu fisika akti de kandela.

[Note: I stole your neat use of ~hetero~ there!]
 

> mi pa fo-amo u histori de u [[Chinese]] piski a

Chinese/China is just ~Cina~ in Glosa. I guess the
international usage wins out here rather than the
local name, which would be more typically the Glosa
choice.

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Wed, 11 Dec 2002 15:03:38 EST

last week there was one glosa-pe [me] above the clouds at the foot of mount 
teide looking across at the top of gran canaria peeping above its clouds and 
perhaps with another glosa-pe on that island. Time to think about glosa which 
seems to be in the clouds itself just now.

I find that I am quite often confused by glosa and other people are confused 
by my burblings. I should like there to be something like a 
standard/normal/orthodoxofficial-glosa2002,  clearly explained so that I 
could write it easily. I may not agree with it and think that there would 
still be confusions but I would know where I stood and could write it.
let us call it 'SG'.
SG would be a euro-glosa as it would assume that its followers would have a 
grounding in european languages, they would understand  SG's having 23 [or 
24?] letter sounds and 48 letter signs to represent them. They would also 
accept the 3 irregularities [q,x and sc]. 

Half of the signs would be commonly used [lower-case] and the others 
[capitals] only used in certain circumstances such as:-
at the beginning of sentences, to begin proper nouns  [what exactly are 
they?] in abreviations etc
A proper noun seems to be like names of people, pets, geographical locations 
etc - 'Robin', 'England', 'Mount Teide', 'Rex'. If I am to write correct 
Glosa, I should like to know exactly when SG  requires caps. 


Mi fu grafo u-ci frasi in norma, [orthodox] Glosa. U lexiko qi ST fu uti, es 
u 'Glosa Inter-Reti Diktionaria' [G.I.R.D].  Ci, na habe u hetera regula:- In 
u titula, singu verba sti ko u kapitali. Qe il fu es ali excepti ad u-ci

being a rebellious and inquisitive child I shall also investigate 'munada 
linugu' which has 23 letter sounds and also 23 letter signs ....
mi fu garafo uci farasi in norama m.l. - u lexiko qui m.l. fu uti, es u

So far, do established glosa-pe agree with my view of a standard Glosa with 
letter signs and capitals following the rules above ?

    I have not seen your call-sign for some time.  Nice to see you are

    Things have gone slower than expected, and with Ron Clark passing on,
and Wendy Ashby somewhat deactivated by arthritis, we are not pushing ahead
quite as fast as we might have been.
    I have said I will do a 2500-word Starter Dictionary, but have been
side-tracked by financial concerns and the Great Australian Drought.  After
my finances settle down - possibly before the New Year - I will seriously
try to gel a medium-sized starter dictionary.  For this I will rely mainly
on the GID and on standard English-language small lists of commonly-used
words.

    Please share your thoughts: what, as you see it, are the immediate
goals and challenges for Glosa?

*Hi to Rob Harris and others New to Glosa.
   Hearing Glosa spoken will be difficult.
   It is Old and New: It is as old as the Indo-European (proto-Aryian) root
stock; it watches as this bifurcates into Greek and Latin; then it draws
the threads together into what remains of the Greek and Latin roots - as
represented in modern science.
   So, Glosa is a synthesis of the very old with the usage of the rather new.
   Sounds like Italian.
   Sentence formation with the structures of English.
   Words are concept centres, rather than concrete objects.
   So, Glosa words, from the Classical languages, are shorn of their
inflectional endings, and represent ideas.
   They are used, within reason, to function as any Part-of-Speech.
   The intepretation of a word's function is given by its place in the
phrase or clause: SYNTAX is the grammar engine of Glosa.
   Oh yes, there's one rule: a word is modified by its precedent(s).
Modifiers precede the word they modify.  And while it is somewhat
misleading to use the categories of 'adjective' and 'adverb', it is still
handy to think in terms of the traditional functions within a sentence.

                      |             |
                      |Compound verb|

   Yet Glosa is not "relexified English".
   Good Glosa 'maps onto' English, BUT English does not automatically 'map
onto' Glosa.

   Glosa users are spread so widely that they are too far away from one
another to hear each other: there are also some problems with the mechanics
of sound files on the Net; and, at the start, Glosa users needs to think
about the words they will use - this can slow down speech, for learners.
In Glosa we ought to use the correct concept rather than slip into
metaphor.  National-language idiomatic usage would be too confusing
altogether.

   Of the national languages, English might be the closest to Glosa in that
it has only five inflected endings, and has a background in both Greek and
Latin.  Also, the SVO order, and the structure of phrases and their
combination into clauses, in English, is considered, by some, to have the
most logical of constructions, and to allow the widest expression of
meanings.  Of course, among the highly inflected languages terribly fine
shades of meaning are possible, EG Russian; Glosa, having NO inflections
benefits greatly from economy of form, but relies on the juxtaposition of
words for its precision.

   What is also similar between English and Glosa is that the
(syntax-based) grammar is more intuitive than proscribed.  Nobody stood up
one day, and said, "Listen here, this is how the syntax of English is going
to go."
   It is claimed that the language sense is hard-wired into our brains, and
that this relies primarily on word order (syntax).  So, while every
language that is spoken is used more or less intuitively, English (and
Glosa) with little (or no) inflections, could work more closely to the way
our brains are 'hard-wired' to work than do the lanuages that are more
inflected. 
  
   With the way things are going on the international scene, we might even
have to wait for civilisation to come around again, before Glosa is heard
on broadcast media.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

Syd suggests:

That would be good if euro-recognition can be sacrificed.
In that case, might as well go the next step as well,
and use 100% bi-syllabic root-concepts. Then it's easy
to compound, generating a huge vocab from the basic set.

I like that idea for several reasons, but it's difficult to do right.
Glosa itself has a basic word-list drawn from Roget. Today there are
other (more scientific) multi-lingual lists, such as EuroWordNet,
which better dissect(s) the top levels of an appropriate "ontology".

A language called "Ro" made 100 top-level divisions, each assigned
to a consonant-vowel pair as you suggest, and these included also the
grammatical necessities such as noun verb etc. There is a good web page
for Ro somewhere under Jeffrey Henning's http://langmaker.com ...
Subdivisions used only 1 letter apiece, completely arbitrarily.

Natural languages have better and easier ways to achieve derivation.
For an auxiliary language, there is extreme pressure to simplify.
The most flexible way is just to word-compound. Tunu is a modern
conlang/auxlang that has only 1500 CVCV-type roots (e.g. "babu")
but systematically derives all the words in several basic-English
word-lists by CVCV-CVCV compounding (e.g. "babu-fufa"). Such a
language would be the easiest for a global (non-euro) audience.

The universal human linguistic tendency is to evolve roots toward
bisyllabic CVCV, and then erode the highest usage/frequency ones
into CV particles (which may be pre- or post-positioned, and may
become affixed to roots). There was a euro-based interlingua spoken
all around the Mediterranean for 800 years called "Lingua Franca"
that followed this pattern, and Glosa should emulate it.

If it is acceptable to sacrifice euro-recognizability, then the
required modifications to G can be very few and nearly painless.
"Supo la perde di reco a Euro, impli la recui cambi di G i posi
poco, anci cuasi manca pena". Or something kinda like that.

Yep, still around! If the context were Esperanto I guess you could say
I kabeis ... Kabe (Kazimierz Bein) was a fellow who did a bunch of work
in Esperanto and then dropped out, thereby earning himself a verb of his
own in Esperanto culture to describe such behavior. Well, I didn't do as
much work as he did (though I did spend many enjoyable hours with the
Glosa dictionary), and I didn't drop out completely, but I did shift my
focus back to Esperanto.

But I have kept the glosalist archives up-to-date! ...

http://www.kafejo.com/lingvoj/auxlangs/glosa/archives/

Esperanto and Glosa aren't really all that different structurally.

P.S. I've found that the salut/salat wordplay works in quite a
few languages. Perhaps with time I can make the international

Here are extracts from PGN87 perhaps for a projected tutorial. It is probably 
more useful to become at ease with translating from Glosa to English or other 
tongue befare doing much into Glosa. We need pieces of Glosa that are 
actually in use rather than purpose built examples and we need to get clear 
the structures of the sentences. There has been a tendency in English and in 
Glosa to shrink away from grammar. Earlier in tutors one was given long lists 
and tables especially of irregularities. Here is the first sentence in this 
PGN, my apologies to its author for not asking permission.

[alphabet and sounds can be inserted later]

'Tem pre oligo meno plu nova-papira-pe e komerci-pe pa dice de u ski de plu 
lingua in Englanda.' 

 [EXTRA PHRASE(time)  while before few months  [Tem pre oligo meno] = a few 
months ago    
SUBJECT      some newspaper-people and commerce-people   [plu nova-papira-pe 
e komerci-pe]
VERB         did speak   [pa dice] 
OBJECT       of the know   [de u ski]
             of the languages   [de plu lingua]
             in England  [in Englanda]

introducing words:- 'plu'/some introduces the subject noun phrase
'did' introduces the verb phrase
'of the' introduces the object phrase
'while before' introduces the extra phrase of time

'people' are the two head words in the subject phrase
'speak' is the head word in the verb phrase
'know' is the head of the object
'months' is the head of the extra phrase

'newspaper'/'commerce' modify [ help/clarify/add to the meaning of] 'people'
'of the languages' modifies 'know'
'in England' modifies 'languages'
EXTRA modifies the verb phrase
'few' introduces months [a noun phrase inside an extra phrase]

From: "Marcel Springer" <marcel{at}mspringer{dot}de>
Date: Fri, 20 Dec 2002 11:37:33 +0100


The Glosa-dictionary on http://www.glosa.org/gid/ has been updated.


I have compared the word list of the book "Français - Glosa 1000" with
the Glosa Internet Dictionary.  Result:

241 corrections or little changes were made to the French list.
    (Mostly missing French accents and wrong "Similar Synonyms".
     Files:
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frgl1ko.htm  - old, original list,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frgl1k.htm   - new, corrected list,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/gl1kfr.htm   - corrected list, reversed,
      http://www.glosa.org/gid/frglcorr.htm - protocol of changes)

And about 1000 (!) additions/little changes/corrections were made to
the GID.  For example 61 new Similar Synonyms were found and cleared
  (File: http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm ).
Many, many English meanings
  (e. g.
  "amusa 1++  amuse; amusement; entertain" <-- "funny" (drôle).
  "magika 1++G  magic; magic spell" <-- "enchant" (enchanter).
  "melano 1++G  black" <-- "dark" (foncé).
  "merito 1++  deserve; earn; merit" <-- "worthy" (digne de).
  "pove 1++  poor" <-- "miserable" (misérable).
  "xanto 1++G  yellow; yolk" <-- "blond" (blond).)
and many new items have been added.
  (e. g.
  "agri-pe 1++  farmer; labourer [agricultural ]" (cultivateur).
  "duce-do 1  town hall; hall [town ]; city hall" (mairie).
  "ergo-pe 1  worker" (ouvrier).
  "graci 1  grace" (grâce).
  "kapila-pe 1  hairdresser; barber" (coiffeur).
  "kloro-zo 1  green belt; belt [green ]" (ceinture verte).
  "pani-bo 1  baker's {shop}; baker's shop" (boulangerie).
  "pani-pe 1  baker" (boulanger).
  "pasivi 1  passive" (passive).
  "piski-pe 1  fisherman" (pêcheur).
  "principi 1  principle" (principe).
  "servieta 1  napkin" (serviette).
  "tropi-ru 1  screwdriver" (tourne-vis).).


I am happy, that the dictionary has made another advance, but it can
be seen, that there is a far way to go, yet:  So many changes only
by comparison with one little list!  It would be good to have a
detailed look at the list "Deutsch - Glosa 1000" as well, I think.

The book "Español - Glosa 1000" does not look as important, because it
seems to be only a translation of an English list made by a
non-Glosa-author.

Here there are some questions I asked Wendy Ashby and her answers.
Sorry, I am late, my letter was from May the 5th and her from June

Possessive Pronoun
==================

In inter-reti na diskusi de u loka de "possessive pronoun".

In classical Glosa the possessive pronoun seems to come before
u(n)/plu:  mi plu vagona - my cars.  Some people in internet (me too)
rather would like to put it after it.

Advantages:
- It would be more regular.  A noun phrase then always would start
  with a (mandatory) u(n)/plu, the main concept word (noun) comes last
  and all attributes - adjectives, genitives, participles and also the
  possessive pronoun - would come between.
- A noun phrase could be easier acknowledged, when it starts with
  u(n)/plu.
- Appositions: "Mi ne amo plu vi simi - I do not like your apes." /
  "... vi plu simi - ... you apes"

Nick contradicts with the example "u fe bovi - a (female) cow,
fe u bovi - her cow", but this does not convince me (could be
"fe-bovi").  Also I do not think, that there could be confusions with
u-mi, u-tu etc.

Perhaps you can explain, why it must (or only should?) be like this?

 - - - - -

WA: "vi plu simi".  Plu kron "plu" es no-nece.  "vi" es ma de mo.
    "vi simi" es sati.

[I find this question very important!!!  I understood,
  "'u(n)/plu' - possessive pronoun - noun"
is okay, but prefereable, if the sentence is not too long, is
  "'u(n)/plu' - noun - 'de' - possessive pronoun".]

She is correct in placement of the possessive/genitive.
Here you have 2 noun phrases combined with or without a
particle. Each can be singular or plural, independently.
Clearest usage invokes the particle DE (and/or SU) to
separate the possessor from the possessed, but in the
real-world, people often elide it, leaving ambiguity.
So "tu simi" could be either insulting or not depending
on context; re-inserting a SU or ES would disambiguate.
(SU is just my suggestion for a new particle to be the
reverse of DE, i.e. the so-called Saxon genitive.)
But she suggests "fe bovi" as a natural elision; most
of the world would prefer "bovi fe" (from elided DE).

> Si tu ne amo "sto" posi tu ma amo:
> "tena se" = restrain myself

I consider the STI and STO of Hogben completely bogus.
TENA is better, but then I'd want 100% bisyllabic roots.
(Words like KONFUSI and IMEDIA also appear bogus to me.)
The truest Glosa has a self-consistency beyond authority.

'St. Lucia es u landa in orienta Karibean Mari.'

SUBJECT St. Lucia [St. Lucia]
VERB is [es]
OBJECT a land [u landa]
   in east Caribean Sea [in orienta Karibean Mari.]

capital S denotes beginning of sentence also, here, a name [an island]; 
capitals L, K, M denote names [an island and a sea]. Because it is a name and 
therefore a noun there is only one being refered to so no number is needed to 
introduce the phrases
In glosa, a word can be verb, noun etc. In this sentence, 'es' is unlikely to 
be anything but a verb so it is easy to decide which is subject and which is 
objekt.


'Id tegu 620 qadra kilometri.' 
 SUBJECT[S] it [Id]
VERB[V] cover [tegu]
OBJECT[O] 620 square kilometre [620 qadra kilometri]

'tegu' could be 'the cover', 'to cover', 'the covered object'but as it 
imediately follows the pronoun 'id', it must be the verb.

a parallel investigation into the developing of munada linugu



SG
'Tem pre oligo meno plu nova-papira-pe e komerci-pe pa dice de u ski de plu 
lingua in Englanda.'

ml:-
'teme pere oligo meno, lu pe-papira-nova e pe-komerici pa dice de u siki de 
lu linugu in Enege-lanada - ' 

here the head  word [oligo, pe, dice] follows the intro word  [teme, pere, lu 
pa u] and a word is modified by the word after it. this is completely 
different from glosa but it makes it much easier to find the head.
the comma indicates that the previous phrase is EXTRA and that the next is 
SUBJECT
all letters are pronounced as in the international phonetic alphabet.

greetings glosa-pe! hope that santa's visit is productive.
apologies also for putting my wanderings into the wilderness on glosalist, 
some may find them interesting.
apologies to charles . his letter with web sites addresses seems to be lost 
in my wilderness. could you repeat them?

I have a copy of roget so i shall do some maths with it.
there are the consonants:- b[0] c[1] d[2] f[3] g[4] j[5] k[6] l[7] m[8] n[9] 
p[10] r[11] s[12] t[13] v[14] x[15] z[16] and the 5vowels aeiou [0 to 4]. 
this makes 85 CV syllables.

if we look up 'world-wide' in roget's index, we get 3 sections, i choose 
'universal' which is section 79. counting the items that are apropriate,    
'world-wide' is number 81 [my maths may be askew but my argument will be 
demonstrated]
divide the section number by the number of CV syllables:- 79/85=0 + remainder 
79
same with item number:- 81/85=0+81
divide the 79 by 5 [syllables ba, be, bi, bo, bu, ca, ce,  etc], we get 14 
consonants remainder 4 = vowels. result ='vu'  add'-'
0/5+0=0; syllable 0='ba' add to the others:- vu-ba
81/5=16+rem1:- ze so 'world-wide becomes 'vu-baze [put the stress on the 
vowel before the '-'.
'language' is section 557 first item [ignore], 
557/85 gives 6 rem 43
6/5 gives 1 rem 1 i.e. 'ce'
43 gives 8 rem 3,      'mo'
'cemo' stress on last syllable
'worldwide language' = 'vu-baze cemo'

[this is a reply to 2 messages, saving virtual paper]

> VERB is [es]

I feel that Glosa is the auxlang for people who hate grammar.
To satisfy them most deeply, I propose the elimination of verbs
and adjectives, etc, leaving only "plain words" (of 2 syllables
or maybe more) and "magic words" (1 syllable only). Words like
is/have/do are "magic" and we never need to spook the potential
clients by use of that intimidating V-word.

> SUBJECT[S] it [Id]
> VERB[V] cover [tegu]
> OBJECT[O] 620 square kilometre [620 qadra kilometri]

I expected "has" instead of "cover". All simple sentences can be
recast to use one of a dozen or so magic auxiliaries instead of
troublesome iffy verbs like "cover".

> and a word is modified by the word after it. this is completely
> different from glosa but it makes it much easier to find the head.

There are 2 problems here (adjectives, compounds) that seem
like 1 (modifiers), and they need different solutions.

True adjectives as in English are not common in other languages,
most either are treated as verbs (e.g. Japanese) or nouns (Latin).
It is possible to allow either word order without chaos:
"white house" = "casa blanca" = "blanca casa" = "house white".
When it becomes necessary to precise the meaning further,
magic words like DE/A/EX restore order within the phrase.

Compound words are the tougher problem, because we really need
to declare for one order or the other. Especially if the vocab
is reduced to approx 5000 CVCV roots, compounding must generate
most of the 50000 or so real-world words in the full lexicon.
I don't know which is best -- but "blancacasa" sounds silly.
Maybe the answer is just to forbid such compounds?

For a good sample of these things see the Kalatunu web page,
wherever that has wandered off to ... or for a bad example,
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/tomato.htm (apologies in advance).

I have several different Roget's from used book sales.
One has a numerical scheme that goes like:

EPIDEMIC, as in
	plague 85.5
	contagious 85.61
	prevalent 863.12
	plentiful 990.7

So all we need are 11 consonants and 11 vowels ...

In original Roget's there were around 1000 major
headings which grouped all words, so a CVC pattern
could handle them all comfortably (20 * 5 * 20 = 2000).

Or we could use the sorted-by-frequency BNC list:
1=the 2=of ... 996=president 997=house ... 199997=horsefly

More seriously, the EuroWordNet project identified a good
base set of word-concepts shared by most euro langs.

I have generated a list of English words translated by
multi-lingual dictionaries; if they don't appear there,
they must not be important ... Here are the FAM- entries
above level 11, higher number indicating higher frequency:

35      fame
15      famed
16      familial
27      familiar
17      familiarity
15      familiarization
16      familiarize
15      familiarized
15      familiarizes
15      familiarizing
12      familiarly
17      families
35      family
27      famine
12      famines
15      famish
12      famished
35      famous
12      famously

I think this implies the need for FAME, FAMILY, FAMINE
and maybe FAMILIAR in any plausible auxlang's base vocab.

  Without actually having studied Glosa, you have done exceedingly well, Tom.
  Beware of word-for-word translation, in that English-language metaphors
and idioms can be translated unthinkingly.
  While the above original paragraph is good poetry and also a profound
thought, translation of such imaginitive language was not the original
intention for Glosa.  And, while I was going to do a pedrestrian version of
the passage, I thought better of it.
  The fact remains that Glosa was put forward originally as a language for
science; and it was intended for direct communication of fact.

  The version I did is more plodding than your leaner version, Tom, but it
has more "T"s crossed and "I"s dotted.
  So, I strongly reccommend trying a few straight sentences first, before
^going out on a limb^ into poetry.
  While Glosa is highly suitable for poetry, I suspect that it will be more
like the classical Chinese poetry, where because of the word economy, both
the meaning and the words of a poem will have to be taught.

  You ask about the use of the semi-colon in Glosa.  The authors originally
postulated that, because of the major role of syntax in Glosa's grammar,
and the fact that punctuation becomes even more of an aid to the
understanding of structure in Glosa, than it is in English,  
that it would be useful to indicate the start of phrases and clauses
differently in Glosa.  Commas, in Glosa, as in English, are the logical
choice to indicate the start of phrases; however, to differentiate between
phrases and clauses, it was decided that the semi-colon would indicate the
start of a clause, where this was needed for clear understanding.
  Regardless of the authors' advice, a number of Glosa enthusiasts have
declared the semi-colon to be ugly and unwarranted, so they persist in
using commas to introduce clauses.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

why bother with grammar?
when we gradually learn our native tongue we are not given the grammar rules 
at the beginning. They are there nevertheless and we sort them out to a 
greater or lesser degree as we go along. why not do the same with Glosa? It 
is not all that easy and pretty slow. much quicker if it is done for us as 
soon as possible, appropriately and as one reads. that's what I'm hoping to 
do.

As/to a would-be creator/inventor/discoverer of language:

You can start with just the roots in a jargon/pidgin stage
like the Chinook Jargon (see the wonderful web site of
Tenas Wawa, somewhere under geocities.com last I looked).
Then you can import a few particles or affixes and get
something more like the Lingua Franca. These were both
real-world, useful auxlangs. And were spoken seriously
by more people than have ever tried Esperanto etc.

The major point to stop forgetting is that an auxlang
must be learned not by children who have the luxury of
100% immersive language brainwashing, but rather by
adults struggling to make a real life who have only a
few hours per week to devote to language study. It had
better not be just a toy language devised imaginatively
but ignorant of linguistic principles, because it won't
work right, and people will drop it just like Glosa etc.

I must admit to losing all hope for Glosa since the
surviving author refuses to either lead or get out
of the way. Nor do I retain any hope that some new
Grand Datuval (see history of Volapuk) will devise
anything better than the 10,000 conlangs already
littering the net (I made one, too) -- none of them
are near good-enough, either. So now it's just English
against the world, later it will be Spanish etc.

You need 3000 to 6000 good short mnemonic roots,
100 particles or affixes, and simple sentence patterns.
Then you must find a bunch of people to agree to use them,
on a continuing, daily basis. Or you just add one more
useless auxlang/conlang/artlang to the trash heap.

"Us" means you and which other auxlang saboteurs this time?
Never mind. I can just wait out your manic period in silence.
Go ahead and demonstrate why evolution didn't work in your case.

*  All true about the numbers and the success.  But that was yesteryear.
Now, what is called for is a Nu-speak for the Net.
   Some form of Munda-lingua must eventually emerge for Cyberspace.
   Considering that Spanish is taking over the US, with the infiltration of
all those wet-backs, and that Spanish is easier to learn than English, such
a language could be it.
   If Glosa can be demonstrated to be a regularised language, with
generally international vocabulary ... also with the logical power of
English, it might beat Spanish.  At the present rate of development, there
is no contest.

*  Funny thing, the techology is in place for the high-level teaching of
any language, and Glosa characters have been kept within the normal
keyboard range.
   I do plan to get the Flash MX set-up, when I can find a student who will
let me buy it on their student card.  And yes, the question remains: can
mind-dead executives learn to think in Glosa.
   So, instructional courses pitched at various levels are needed, and for
a while we had a thing going with various groups in Uganda.  The endemic
poverty in that country was both the reason that they responded to our
call, and also the reason for the difficulties we had in supplying them
with materials and equipment.  X = 0
   The other problem that did arise - quite surprisingly to me - was the
reluctance of the would-be Glosa learners to attempt to write in the
language, quite apart from trying to speak in it.
   You could say we had a problem.
   While Glosa appears to follow, and extend, the developmental trend of
the highly successful super-creole, English, it has ended at one extreme of
the linguistic spectrum ... being devoid of inflection.  Now, all national
languages have some inflection, and, while the very heavily inflected,
Latin has bitten the dust, some very popular languages, like Russian, are
extremely strong on inflection, still.  Chinese does stand out as having
unchanging characters. Where have I heard that word "unchanging" before?
   Even though the Chinese could take to Glosa, as the European-like
language whose sentence structure is closest to theirs, I suspect that
'inflection' could be part of the 'hard-wiring of language' built into our
brains.  However, I am convinced that the Universal Grammar, whatever it
is, is primarily Syntax-Based, as is Glosa.

*  Well, do we mean that people have dropped Glosa, or that people would
drop Glosa if they found it to be more of a 'toy language' than a real one?
   Part of my brief is to demonstrate that Glosa is a usable pedestrian
language, suitable for everyday intercommunication, as well as a language
that permits the conveying of exact meaning.
   As I see it, the everyday usage ought to come before the more
complicated employment of Glosa.  I do believe that the structure is sound,
and that the innovation of semantic "inflections" can be effected through a
simple system of compounding.

>I must admit to losing all hope for Glosa since the
>surviving author refuses to either lead or get out
>of the way. 
*  True, Wendy Ashby ought to get over her arthritis or hand the reins on
to someone, or to some group, capable of developing and 'completing' the
language.  A more dynamic leadership, with a definite 'marketing plan'
could do wonders for Glosa.
   Wendy could make a miraculous recovery, and the language could be
completed to the global dissemination stage.  It seems that our prayers are
in order, here.

Nor do I retain any hope that some new

*  I had imagined, long ago, that highly creative people, dissatisfied with
the global mish-mash of language, would have arisen to broaden the Internet
by adding the missing global communication medium to the Net: quel domage.
   It would seem that numbers of science have won, while the qualitative
values of the humanities have lost.

English is a lovable communication medium, but its patchwork nature does
not suit it to the global learning required for global use.  Another
national language, like Spanish, could succeed where English is failing,
but does Spanish provide sufficient foundation for the next stage of
civilisation?

*  I am sorry that Charles experience of Interlinguistics has soured his
view.  The numbers above, sound true, though I don't think we need quite so
many particles and affixes - though were we to compile a list of all those
of Glosa, including the generic extensions, we might come close to Charles'
hundred.
   The final cruncher is that human beings are so unbelievably optimistic.
We keep thinking that some bright spark will come along, invent something,
and then all of our problems .. of communication, language, etc .. will be
over.
   The sad part is that when people are sitting on top of the mountain,
they do not realise that they have arrived, and that it is up to them to
plant the flag.  I believe that Glosa needs only a little tweaking - with
no serious change in substance - to flatten  the bumps and smoothe around
the sharp edges.  Some form of administration could be derived to maintain
Wendy's authority, while opening the regulation of the language to a more
vigorous group of trustee/developers.
   But, what is urgently needed is for Glosa-pe to use (or try) the
language.  It was only when I took the plunge, and started converting the
"Three Bears" into Glosa, that I came up against the practical questions
involved in using the language.  I wanted to capture Goldilocks' anguish,
and the bears' sense of loss, as she ran from them: I was not content with
simply telling a story.
   As Ron Clark said to me, twenty-five years ago, "Play with the language."

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*  I agree with Sid that Glosa grammar need not be taught as a
pre-requisite to using Glosa, but I feel that properly graded reading
allows the gradual introduction of the various grammatical elements.
   However, some people will demand to know why .. this, and why .. that.
So, if Glosa teaching is based on the hypertext principle, people will be
able to read - taking the grammar 'on trust' - until they find the need to
back-track and check a link from the basic text to its associated
explanation.  This idea makes a story readily accessible to the fast
learner, while giving all of the back-up required for those who need
explanations.

   It's fairly obvious that I am thinking in terms of releasing Glosa
learning materials on CDs using HTML coding.  For the non-Net versions, the
explanations would, I imagine, be better on the adjoining page, rather
than, serially, throughout the text.

*** One request from me to Sid: please bring in your right margin; this
allows for the inevitable expansion of text that follows addition of the
standard email quote-marks.  Thanx.

*  Thank you Sid,
   I agree with the substance of all that you say: I'd just like to think
that the explanations were not necessarily so lengthy.
   As I understand it, we do not want to make the explanations of Glosa's
functioning so intrusive that they interrupt the flow of the ideas in the
text.
   However, to make use of such detailed explanations as yours, here,
perhaps we neet to think hard about the format and staging of such
explanations.  Before I heavy-handedly suggest alternative formats, I would
ask you, Sid, to think of ways you could keep the explanations relevant to
the sections of text they elucidate, while maintaining the integrity of the
basic text.

***  Please note: I did shorten the line lengths to allow the RHS margin to
be brought in slightly.   R.

Saluta, 

Robin

*  There is an interesting conceptual conflict going on.
   For me the understanding of Glosa follows from the rather traditional
ideas of phrases and clauses, and the functioning of the words that make
them up.
   As an extra level of syntax understanding, the more 'Functional Grammar'
idea of the "head" word of a phrase solidified this for me.  But, I see the
'head' of a NOUN PHRASE as the main NOUN; and the 'head' of a VERB PHRASE
as the main VERB.  And then, when it finally came to me, that Ron Clark's
dictum, "A word is modified by its precedent," leads to a fairly clear-cut
'head-final' structure in the phrases, things fell into place.
   So, it is mystifying to me that Sid does not recognise the final word in
a phrase as the 'head' of that phrase.  As I see it, the phrase builds in
semantic power from the least significant word at the start, to the most
semantically significant word at the end: this last word is the 'head.'

  And, without being unkind, nor through calling upon another lqanguage, I
would expand Wendy's ADVERBIAL PHRASE, 'Tem pre oligo meno,' to make the
time relationship painfully clear: 

                  ~Tem plu previo oligo meno, ... ~
            /          /      \       \     \
 [for,during] [all of the] [previous] [few] [months]

   Each word contributes to the full modification of the central VERB
~dice~, and the logic of the situation tells us that the order is fairly
set, in that we cannot change the order without causing the phrase to sound
odd.  This logic is based on the notion that each successive word is more
semantically important that the last,
   IE re time --> countable --> before now --> quantity --> unit of time

   It can be said that I believe there is a full sentence from which words
might be elided to make up a more vernacular version of Glosa.  It can also
be said that I feel learners ought to be taught to use the 'full version'
of Glosa before they start to move to a more elided version of the language.
   This expanded Glosa might be described as the more 'discursive' mode of
the language; while Ron Clark often mentioned the 'telegramatic' use of
Glosa, I feel that such an abbreviated usage should come only with a clear
understanding of the words we are leaving out. 
   
>the comma indicates that the previous phrase is EXTRA and that the next is 
>SUBJECT
*  This is only fair to the reader: puctuation is an indication of the
syntactic units of the sentence.  While "EXTRA" might be meaningful to Sid,
the WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN, WHY and HOW answered by ADVERBIAL PHRASES and
ADVERBIAL CLAUSES have more analytical value for me.  I saw this more as a
"WHEN phrase"  than as an "EXTRA phrase."

  While some people have receive no grammatical training during English
lessons, and thus have no framework for their understanding of Glosa, the
necessary grammatical information can be introduced through properly graded
Glosa instruction.  We might be getting there.

*  Hi Sid, 
   This is one way of "doing" interlinguistics.
   Have to admit, it reminds me of the "nonsense sylables" I learnt were
being used to test people's learning ability.
   Actually I am not very intelligent when it comes to memorising 'nonsense
sylables,' so I gave a complete miss to the whole segment of a-priori
designed languages.  I would say that it would be impossible for me to
learn an a-priori language, so I didn't even consider trying.
   I am an example of someone who needs to understand what he is learning:
this translates into my interest in the etymology of words; as long as I
can find a story behind a word - where it came from, what primitive root it
is based on, etc - I can store that word away .. with its story attached.
I guess I might have been pretty dumb had I been shipwrecked off the
Chinese coast, and brought up to remember hundreds of sounds that were
unrelated to their written forms.
   When I was told the story of Glosa, I thought that it could work for me,
because I had come in contact with some of the Classical roots during my
education in Agriculture, and also because of their being a major part of
the history of English.  While I am not good with languages, I do get
letters to the editor, in English, printed in the paper.
   So, yes, everyone has slightly different versions of the language
ability, and I would have been right up against it, were I to have grown up
in a non-Indo-European culture, and tried to learn Glosa.

   Although Glosa's reliance on the Classical roots might be a disadvantage
to those outside the Indo-European tradition, it surely gives a head-start
to people with a European background, or a history of scientific, or
Classical, study.  The 'nonsense sylable' approach to planned languages
gives no-one an advantage, and puts some, like me, at a distinct disadvantage.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

Catty (Charles) are you deranged or do you

to try getting a reaction out of people?

Obviously you understood none of
the Glosa lines I wrote as an answer
of your other accusatory message.

I haven't trashed any group. As a
matter of fact I support quite a few
auxlang discussion groups and put
forth effort and dedication to the 
study of auxlangs. What this has
to do with religion, I do not really

attempt at flaming on your part and

Jay raved some more:

> Obviously you understood none of
> the Glosa lines I wrote

That's right! Parts resembled your usual Gode-lang rants,
but I don't understand those either. The defect is in your
thoughts, rather than any language you pollute with them.

Continuing:

The problem with Glosa is that it's rough and unfinished,
and doesn't work right linguistically. Most of the other
people participating in this group have grown dissatisfied
with Glosa and want to reform it, the remainder are unable
to write anything comprehensible in it. This includes the
authors, whose samples are/were mere idiomatic relexes that
cannot be understood by non-English speakers. But there is
real merit to the basic idea of using an analytic grammar
with latinate roots, as in the Lingua Franca. Unfortunately
there's no other existing language like that, except Glosa.

(Peano's Interlingua was absorbed into Occidental, which
has many analytic features but still relies on suffixes.)
I use Occ quite a bit for international correspondence, but
would still like to see Glosa reformed and revived to act as
a global interlingua, something acceptable outside Europe.
This doesn't seem the least bit likely to happen, though.
It would require that Wendy appoint a group to carry on
Glosa development, particularly now that she is inactive.

Any language will evolve over time to cover any deficiencies
felt by its speakers in daily use. Glosa could do likewise
with a sufficient community of users; Esperanto accomplished
this to a great extent, adding latinate roots that Zamenhof
(Espo's creator) resisted. I just don't have 100 years to
wait for it to evolve far enough (or 1000 years for Glosa).

It all leaves Glosa nowhere, and this group unusable for a
discussion of possible reforms, because of outside agitators
like the mad-dog Jay, and a few loyal diehards who can't
use it but don't want it changed either.

I believe that those who've put
effort into getting Glosa up on
the web have done an great
job with the resources available.

What have you done for it?

All it takes is a little practice and
some patience and you can pretty
much understand what someone
else writes in Glosa. I do not hold
to the opinion that it is somehow
unusable. It has been used it is in
use and this makes it definitely
usable. 

The lack of grammatical "parts
of speech" (POS) markings in
Glosa means that a definite word
order needs to be followed. Too
much freedom in this regard shows
that we humans depend on this
established sequencing and that
if it isn't there we tend to not 
understand each other well. It's
all a matter of habit. Obviously
people from different language
backgrounds carry grammatical
bagage with them and everytime 
they try learning a new language
their old habits may get in the way.
But consider this... An auxlang
that would be taught to school
children... and this auxlang would
have the graeco-latin roots of 
scientific terminology... well, I 
think this is the kinda goal Wendy
would go for. Endless grammar
discussions and reform move-
ments would not be high on her
list of priorities. So...

The "Problem" _is_ that you want
to reform it so much that it would
be a totally different language. If
so why not make up your own lang
and publish it? Occidental had all 
sorts of reforms, and it is a big lie 
on your part to say that... 
"Peano's Interlingua was absorbed 
into Occidental" 
Not at all! If anything IALA's
Interlingua is a lot closer to Peano's
language than Occidental. Go 
figure where you get all your
raving anger and hate towards
it. The "Problem" is also that
you keep putting Glosa down 
in this list. If you don't like it
then go find a merry pasture
someplace else in cyberland.

If you're so fond of Occi why
haven't you posted anything
in the Occidental list at Yahoo
Groups? You don't really have
a good command of that either
don't you, just like your Glosa
probably, but that's ok, just
give it some practice bud...
Instead of tearing down build
yourself up, but not at the expense
of putting others down as you
seem so fond of doing.

Since,
Jay B.

I put up some pages that show up on many search engines.

It's on the masthead of the Kosmoglot magazines,
approved by old Giuseppe himself. I put up a facsimile
of Kosmo #1 some time ago ... Kosmo allowed discussion
and criticism from all quarters. Decent people do not
try to prevent other's free speech, they welcome it.
You are so ignorant of IAL history.

I don't approve of Bob P's marketing methods. He won't
allow it to breathe. Occ is very flexible and permits
a user to adapt it to circumstances. I have test-driven
Ila vs. Espo vs. Occ with a lot of Spanish-speaking
relatives and friends, and they all hated your Ila.
Some prefer Espo because it's more exotic. Surprising.

> Instead of tearing down build

Jay, if you would stop your ad-hominem attacks and just
reply to points rationally, you wouldn't be such an ass.
Stop following me from group to group and slinging mud.
Better still, just don't read my posts, since you can't
tolerate free exchange of opinions. I have the right to
express myself without an ugly chihuahua biting at my

Glosa is very close to LF, and could become as successful if
it were cleaned up (vocab roots) and regularized (particles).
The adjective-noun order can be allowed to vary, it doesn't
impede understanding; and verb phrase start/end confusion can
be easily eliminated by use of particles. That's all, but we
currently lack a "political" mechanism to accomplish this.

> Spanish is easier to learn than English,

Only some parts. Overall it's about the same. Why not take
the easiest/best of both? Analytic syntax, latinate roots;
sounds familiar.

That's my thought. Occidental already covers most of that
territory (and in fairness, so does IALA's dictionary),
but Glosa was supposed to reach beyond Europe for its users,
and its simplified CVCV-type words assist in that direction.

again shows your prejudice. If 
Robin needs reasons to ban you
from this list, your use of foul language
and your racial slurs should be enough.

Good riddance!

It is probably unwise to step into the middle of this epic flamewar between 
Jay and Charles, but if anyone is interested I have started a project to 
design a new language with isolating grammar and "latinate" roots.  So far 
we have a modest Yahoo group and 100 or so messages, most of which are me 
dumping the thoughts I have had over the last couple of years.  Might make 
some light holiday reading:

Let me guess. AUXLANG has bled itself dry, and so its vampires
are now loose, searching for groups to suck the life out of?

And since James can't draw any attention to himself, he can only
follow his idiot brother here to bother me again ... and couldn't
even trouble to devise a new subject line for his spam.

I just looked at your pitiful group, James. Only the same few
idiots and agitators from AUXLANG are there. And you seem to
have gotten bored with it already.

Around 90% of the world's languages usually place the subject
before the predicate. But only half put the direct object after
the verb. And only half put the noun after the adjective. Among
just the euro-based languages, the proportions remain similar.
So any auxiliary language that chooses (just 1 of the 4 orders),
loses (its claim as a world language).

It is easy to mark the beginning of a verb phrase or direct object
with a particle, which allows their positions to be interchanged
without loss of intelligibility. And swapping the positions of
adjectives and nouns leads to no fatal confusion, even without
adding particles to remove all ambiguity. In fact, most languages
do not maintain a full and separate category for what we call
adjectives in English. (So there is no need for p.o.s. marking.)

This can be easily fixed in Glosa, as long as every verb phrase
is initiated by one of the tense/aspect/mood/voice particles
and every noun phrase begins with an article or preposition.
Also, adverbs of manner (ablatives etc) should be rendered as
prepositional noun phrases, not squeezed into the verb phrase.
Word order is then nearly as flexible as Esperanto, but simpler.

The aim of any auxiliary lang must be maximum ease of learning
with sufficiently powerful expressiveness (not the reverse).
This begins with the alphabet, both spelling and pronunciation.

After a lot of experimentation I keep returning to the same
conclusion, that Glosa has too many sounds and spellings,
owing to its inherited Greek bias. Taking Italian/Spanish as
models for consonant reduction, we can eliminate troublesome
letters (H J K Q W X Y Z) and the more difficult sounds.
The resulting phonology would be very acceptable globally.

There are approx 6000 CVCV roots common to Romance langs
(and most IALs). They can be generated automatically by
an impartial machine algorithm, and re-run to update the
vocabulary as often as desired. Ambiguities are resolved
where possible. (A bit of routine hand-tuning might help,
but we don't need to rely on some great leader's genius.
Instead we can let common collective usage decide matters.)

A pure CVCV vocabulary is better adapted to compounding.
The uniform word-shape is more fluent and dignified.
It lacks the immediate recognizability of longer words
(in Occidental/etc) but has considerable mnemonic value.

Esperanto's severe disfigurement of international roots
and the many silly arbitrary choices of the current vocab
can thus be avoided/repaired. The result seems already
sufficient for real-world use, certainly much improved
versus the current Glosa set (about 33% is identical).

BTW, it turns out that CVC is really insufficient, so the
Ido/Esperanto trick of using p.o.s. final vowels can't work.
CVCVC gives slightly nicer roots (e.g. FELIN vs GATO) but
seems too heavy and invites suffixation. And adding more
consonants (e.g. H J) yields very few roots while excluding
very many people who can't pronounce or distinguish them.

Only the minimum necessary grammatical apparatus can be
sufficiently simple for adults to learn in their limited
free time. Fewer than 100 particles are needed for a
workable analytical language, so they can and should
all follow a CV pattern, distinguishing them from the
CVCV roots at a glance. They mark off phrase boundaries
and together with a few sentence patterns (syntax rules)
they can essentially implement the whole grammar, without
resorting to painful nonsense like "parts of speech".

Glosa's set of particles is unacceptable and incomplete.
They need to be selected from the natural source languages
rather than invented; no language inventor is more ingenious
than the hundreds of millions who together evolved the
Romance languages during 2 millenia of real life. All the
necessary particles are well-known to linguists, who have
described the same or similar functions in nearly every
language yet discovered. We just need to collect them.

I don't have an algorithm for that, though -- and not
knowing Greek Latin etc, I can't make the selections.
Maybe a pidgin stage would help to sort them out.

End of suggestions. Happy New Year, brave new world.
