    Quite some time ago I took the Glosa Basic Reference from my web
pages and "cut it down to size" by deleting the Glosa-English portion
and reformatting it somewhat for personal use.  This evening, with some
judicious editing, I processed that in turn.  What I came up with was a
list of approximately 155 word pairs (or a triple or two), some for the
same thing and some instances of the same term differing only by the
terminal vowel.  I advocate that in each instance, one term be accepted
and the other(s) dropped.  I append the list for information.  Note
that this list does -not- cover all the possibilities of couplets and
triplets in Glosa 6000.  Because of the manual editing process, it is
possible that I missed something here and there.

*   The last time something was knocked into shape by "mass action" was the
refining of the _Tense Table_.  This was done, off-line, by different
people looking at the copy of the Tense Table they recieved, and rewriting
it and adding to it, so that the final form was a melding of many inputs,
with the resultant 'stabalised' form of the Table being the version that
people were happy with after it had been through many hands.
    Maybe the Net is supposed to work like this, too.  But, so far, the
Glosalist hasn't worked as a ^hands on^ experimental work-place in the same
sort of way.  Bottle-necks occur, and this slows down the innovation
process: up to now, I have been the main bottle-neck, because I am the one
who went through the dictionary - word for word - in an attempt to
stabalise it.  The only other substantial effort since then has been Bill
Patterson's compiling of a list of English-language words for which he
could find no Glosa equivalents.
    It took me a long while going through this list trying to find
equivalent words from the existing Glosa dictionaries or the Latin
dictionary, or by creating compound words or phrases that would act as
equivalents.  After I type this up, and it will be a long list added as an
"Attachment", I will ask for feedback from the members of this List.  I
will also send a copy to the authors.
    As soon as I mail off the list of "missing words" I will start
seriously on the job of chopping down the "6000" to at least half of its
size: this will be approached on an *every second word must go* sort of basis.
    I am not saying that others should not attempt the same, just that
others are not.  Hence, I need to work a bit harder to give you a shorter
dictionary to look at, think about and ammend.  One possible "missing word"
for example, is 
 JOB.  Do we lump it in with WORK, or do we divide 'work' up into smaller
pieces called 'jobs'?  What is the Glosa equivalent of the English-language
word, "job": is it ~ergo~, ~opus~, ~job~ or can it be any of these?

>>   Can we have a *definitive* list of phrase
>> markers?  Never use the semicolon, it's invisible in speech. 
>
*   Well, the authors settled on the semi-colon for dividing clauses in
text, because they thought that, with syntax being the main factor in
grammar, they would need to indicate clause boundaries very clearly.  The
semi-colon was elevated to the status of a "syntax marker."
    If you don't like the semi-colon, put forward your own suggestion with
examples of Glosa text demonstrating it.  As I see it, text is the main
problem in communicating meaning: there is no emotion, intonation, emphasis
or pausing.
So, it is my belief that written communication needs a hell of a lot more
help, in trying to get the message through, than does spoken communication.
    Looking at relative values, I think that putting a distinctive,
non-verbal syntax marker in written text is more important than the fact
that such an indication cannot be heard in speech.
    As I recall, the Glosa authors were quite happy with the comma for
normal phrase marking, where it seems either necessary or helpful.  When I
write parallel texts in Glosa and English, I look at the two sentences, and
evaluate them separately: I read the English-language sentence, and decide
whether or not the phrases need marking off with a comma; and then, I read
the Glosa sentence, independently of the first, sensing whether commas are,
or are not, needed in it.  There does not seem to be a direct 'mapping
across' of the punctuation marks from one language to the other: each seems
to imply its own rules of 'punctuation'.

*   Yes, a complete book of _Glosa Grammar - By Example_ would be a great
thing.  You are all invited to send in your own examples; there is no
guarantee that they will be among the finally-accepted examples adopted by
the group; nor will your intellectual property be rewarded.  Such a
'group-think' product would bear the GEO (Glosa Education Organisation)
copyright mark, which means that the Glosa charity would own the results of
our collective participation.
    I put a case here for "altruism": 'think not what your world can do for
you, but what you can do for your world'.  The above suggestion is one of
organised anarchism: while no-one is "boss", neither are we losing our
authority, nor are we losing to someone else's advantage.  The authors did
not create the mechanics examples with word functions indicated: I did.
So, I can be free to give away this idea for the greater good.  While, for
those who would be worried about having their intellectual productions
stolen by others who would profit from them, placing the G.E.O. copyright
on the final book (GG-BE), would protect our collective efforts from
possible outside exploitation.

*   Why on earth, did I attempt to retell in Glosa children's stories, like
the "Three Bears" legend?  The grammar inherent in this story is absorbed
by osmosis: it is a story that tells itself; most of us know what is coming
next.  This is the sort of "context" you ask for.  The sentences of the
childrens stories are the examples of the 'mechanics' of the language,
while the stories give the context.
    I didn't say that writing these stories was easy, just that I worked
hard to make the final products easy to read.
    When are you going to try your hand at Glosa, by retelling your
favourite(s) in Glosa?

*   This truth is the main contribution, so far, from Paul Bartlett to the
refining of Glosa.  Paul states the case very clearly, and leaves it to the
sense of the writer/speaker to decide whether context does, or does not,
indicate the need for particles.
    Formerly, I had thought that all Glosa documents had to be 'machine
readable' for the purpose of Machine Translation.  But no: Glosa, like all
languages operates at different levels, and Paul pointed out that it was
'wrong' to demand the repetition of tense markers and determinants, where
they were essentially redundant.
    When, on the other hand, it might become necessry to run Glosa
documents through the Translating Machine, we could see the possibility of
^topping and tailing^ Glosa texts, prior to running them through the
translator, by adding the 'missing particles', for the benefit of
translation.  
    So, I still see the "verbose", full form of Glosa with the redundant
particles in place, and the "vernacular" form with the otherwise redundant
particles 'elided.'  I suspect that Paul would not see things this way:
even so, when we write conversational Glosa, both of our versions of the
language come out looking much the same.

*   A Greater Glosa dictionary - somewhere in the sky - has many more than
6000 words, but we havent caught them all yet.  Yes, the most suitable
Classical roots should be available for compound formation, but also for
the selection of basic words.  We have agreed that a first dictionary with

in "6000", I found, in practice, that the "6000" was a lot more comfortable
for me than being restricted to the "1000" list.

    Paul suggests work in languages other than English.  I must ask about
this: there are Glosa-pe in most European countries, and Glosa-X
dictionaries do exist for most Euro-languages.
    Yes, there is some prejudice, but the main opposition is apathy towards
the concept of Language Reform.

Yep, I'm still around. But I've been awfully busy the last month or so
and am currently getting over a nasty cold. Can't wait to add the missing
words to the dictionary!

If we could just get rid of all the synonyms we could cut the size down
a great deal. I know there's still a bunch lurking in there that I missed.
I'm certain that I found most of the ones that were defined using the same
English word(s), but I know that some remain because they were defined by
English synonyms that I didn't catch. That is, if glosa1 and glosa2 were
defined as english1, I found them. More difficult to find are cases in
which glosa1=english1 and glosa2=english2, and english1 and english2 are
synonyms themselves!

I tried once to categorize the whole bunch,
similar to the way Paul has them on his web page.
Arranging them in classes would show more clearly
the comparative overload of terms in certain areas.
I know of a few efforts to arrange a hierarchy
of terms (Rick Harrison, WordNet, some AI stuff)
but nothing complete for this purpose. When making
such a subdivision of semantic space, one is
forced to confront one's metaphysical biases
or else simply inherit them from someone else.

It really doesn't take much money to do so.
They just don't think the net is important enough.
I mean, even my cats have their own domain!

 --------------------------------------

And so, it must be stated that these selections follow no mechanical or
statistical rationale: they follow the subjective sensation of mouth and
ear (mine); for each synonym group, I chose the alternative that sounds
best in use, and feels better in the mouth, when spoken.

    With feed-back from the Glosalist group, alterations can be made, and
the final selections will be used to adjust the existing word-lists, that
are in electronic form.

    Because this 'Bartlett List of Synonyms' is in e-mail format and is
shorter than the 'Patterson List of Omissions', I completed it first;
however, the Omissions List is ready to be typed up, and will be sent as an
"Attachment".  Let me know if your system fails to get my "Attachments" and
I will resend the List as a "Redirection."

    After that, some juggling must be done to knock the final, optimised,
standardised, and non-synonym list into a final _Glosa Net
Dictionary_ that everyone is happy with.

    We will have to work fast if we are to meet the 1/1/99 deadline for
completion of what I nickname "Glosa 2.5K".

I must try to put some thought into Glosa grammar, but I'm just so busy at the
moment.  At least the two week Christmas holidays will soon be with me -- 14
days with the inlaws and 14 days without a common language :-(

Subject: Re: Word Pairs and Terminal Vowels
To: GLOSALIST
Date: Tue, 15 Dec 98 23:2

    I will not try to address Robin's post point by point, as I think
that is unnecessary.  There are, to me, three major consideration:

1)  As to the Greek/Latin pairs, I think it is enough just to pick one;
I have no strong opinions as to which in most cases.

2)  Some things Robin brought out may just be disambiguation, such as
a(d)/topo, making clearer which is what.  (The Glosa documents do not
always make such things clear.)

    In these two matters it is more or less an issue of clarification
and selection from among existing material.  I am presuming that
Richmond should not have too much trouble with this.  (At least, if I
were in their situation, I would not.)  Perhaps, if there is some
agreement among (actual or potential) 'net users of Glosa, Robin would
be a suitable person to convey the intentions of such usages to G.E.O.

3)  In some instances, however, I think that Robin was trying to make
unnecessary distinctions.  There needs to be some limit to making
distinctions with nouns and verbs.  That's what adjectives and adverbs
are for.  Otherwise, let us abolish all adjectives and adverbs and have
a gazillion nouns and verbs, all of which make the most minute
distinctions within their own instrinsic meanings!

    This is primarily a clarification: 'a(d)' = "to, toward"; 'topo' =
"at (a place)".

> >akusti, audi  ...  akusti [listen to]; audi [hear]

    This I think is an unnecessary distinction.  Even in English it is
fairly subtle, and Glosa need not slavishly follow every subtle
distinction of just one language.  If Glosa is to be a relatively simple
language to learn and use, it should leave subtleties to qualifiers
(adjectives and adverbs).

> >aqa, hidro  .....  hidro [water] ... aqa (reasonable synonym)  +++

    Pick one or the other.  And was it Brother Irvine who suggested a
distinction between water in general and drinkable water?  Leave such a
distinction to an adjective or adjectival phrase.

> >artikula, artro .  artikula  ~~~~~ [joint; good enunciation]

    In this instance I will go with Robin.  I do think that avoidance
of consonant clusters, when the opportunity presents itself, is a
legitimate design goal for the sake of those people whose native speech
habits make consonant clusters difficult for them (unlike the habits of
us Germano-Slavic speakers).

> >bio, vita  ......  bio [life, living]; vita [life energy]

    Nope.  Just use one.  "LIfe energy" sounds too much like the
discredited old notion of "elan vital."  Why not just 'energi de bio'
instead of a separate term?  Again, avoid unnecessary distinctions when
a qualifying word or short phrase will do the trick.  Whenever possible,
lessen the learning and memory burden.

> >destru, nekro  ..  destru [destroy]; nekro [death]

    A reasonable split.

> >fascina, faskina . fascina === spelling difference only

    Yes.  However, this does bring up another matter.  In at least one
G.E.O. publication, there is the pronunciation rule of 'sc' = "sh"
(English), and yet 'sc' is hardly used.  Why 'skience' and not
'science'?

> >feki, kopro .....  feki  ~~~~~ [dung, faeces]

    I myself would recognize 'kopro' better, but that is a problem with
the whole matter of Greek/Latin pairs.  Recognition will depend in part
on a individual's background, and you can't please everybody.

> >frigi-tem, hiberna ... hiberna  ~~~~~ [winter]

    'Frigi-tem' saves an unnecessary word.  I am definitely in favor of
saving a vocable to be learned when a simple compound or phrase will do.
Why add to the learning burden?

> >gene, esce  ....  gene [gets, becomes]; esce [develops into, becomes]

    What is the difference between the two "becomes" in this instance?
As for "gets," maybe things are different in Australian English, but in
American English "get" is a very, very slippery word.  I vehemently
propose that "get" be dropped from ALL discussion in Glosa.  It causes
more trouble than anything else.  It is completely unnecessary and is
so ambiguous as to be a major source of problems of understanding.

    Why not just have 'fito-hema' = "plant-blood" for "sap" and be done
with it?  Again, it would save a word.  Here there are again unnecessary
distinctions which just add to the memory burden.

> >kapsu, kapsa, paketa, teka ... %%%

    No.  Unnecessary distinctions.

  The Greek 'ostrakon' meant primarily "postsherd" and only secondarily
the shell of certain life-forms.

    Unnecessary distinctions again.

    In the real-world of practical communications, what's the

    Again, what's the difference?  This is unneeded hairsplitting.

    Some languages get along with one term.  Why not Glosa and save
effort?

> >pan, panto  .... panto [all]; pan (brief form)

    I think we should keep abbreviated compounding forms to a minimum.
Otherwise we risk winding up like Lojban with its sometimes baffling
combining forms.  I do not see the saving of a single syllable to be
worth the effort of wrestling with two words.  Make them 'okto',
'panto', and 'penta' and have done with it.

> >po, post  ...... posto[in rear,afterwards];post[afterwards];po[after]

   Ambiguous.  Are you trying to differentiate between time and space?

    Unnecessary.

> >qo numera?,qanto? qo numera[how many(countables)];qanto[h.m. uncount]

    My understanding is that not all languages distinguish between count
and mass.  Why should Glosa at the risk of added complication?

> >qo-mode?, komo? . qo-mode  ~~~~~ [how, which way]

    Abolish 'komo' as superfluous.

> >saluta, ave  ... saluta [greetings]; ave [salutations, respect]

    Is Glosa to be like some languages in which the words used depend on
the relative social status of the individuals?  Simplify, simplify,
simplify!

    Unnecessary.

    Abolish 'strata'.  Use 'solidi via' and save an unneeded term.

    One more unneeded and burdensome diminutive.

    'Termo-tem'.  Save four words for the four seasons.

    'Tetra' only.

    What's the difference in a practical language?  Again, use modifiers

    'Zero' or 'nuli'.

    However, this can be a tricky method.  What sounds good to your ear
and feels good to your mouth may not necessarily do so to mine.  Even a
person's native language may influence this heavily.  Unfortunately, so
far as I know, on this forum we do not have other-than-native-English
speakers among us.

    This will be good.  (By the way, there need to be enough terms to
allow discussing Glosa in Glosa.)

    I suggest that this deadline may be a mite to tight.  And I don't
even recall reading of it.  (However, that may be due merely to a faulty
memory.)

The general drift of the phonology is vowel-final,

This isn't the greatest example of it, but 'twill serve.

Latinish "-esce" isn't even a real word ...
"gene" is good, though.

Hmm. Glosa does have such pairs of full/abbreviated words,
but I don't like that feature; "kausa" is much better.
Same for "ki". There should be no such over-optimization
for short words in an auxiliary language; over time
some longer (5 letters is long??) might erode naturally,
but initially "kausa"/"kine" is more mnemonic.

Maybe March 1st is more realistic for adding the "missing" ones?

    And which "water" serves in the interim: aqa OR hidra?

From: Paul O Bartlett
Subject: Glosa 2.5K?
To: glosalist
Date: Sat, 19 Dec 98 16:5

    I was off Glosalist for some time, so I have probably missed out on
some things.  Robin has referred, at least informally, to a "Glosa
2.5K," which is (or is to be) a list of about two and a half thousand
words/concepts for which there will be Glosa counterparts.  How was
this list constructed?  Apart from the cleanup selection of specific
vocables (terminal vowels, Gree/Latin pairs, and the like), is it the
intention that such a list be the (or a) basic vocabulary, for 'net use
if nothing else?  Has anything been proffered on the issue of dealing
with proper names and specialist vocabulary (e.g., science, law,
medicine, engineering)?

    Once there is some sort of agreed-upon basic vocabulary list, at
least for 'net use, has any thought been given to expanding the
"Mechanics of Glosa" with some samples of connected text?  (I might be
willing to help on this, time and energy allowing.  The "Mechanics"
would also need to be checked for standardized forms.)  Does G.E.O.
know that all this activity is going on?  If so, what is their
reaction?

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Sat, 19 Dec 98 07:4

Sorry Friends,

  I sent this post before completing it.  I continue here at the "***"
mark -

in replying to Aaron's comments.


>***

>>> >artikula, artro .  artikula  ~~~~~ [joint; good enunciation]

>>

>>Maybe artro ~~~~~~ [knuckle] ???

>>

*   After reading Paul's comments about possibly using an adjective for
drinking water, rather than a specific word for "potable water", I think
this principle is the one we should be persuing, for Glosa in general,
and for the 

2.5K list, in particular.  Perhaps using ~artikula~ for articulation,
generally, is in line with the hard-to-define concept language idea.


>>> >austra, sud  ....  sud  ~~~~~ [south]

>>

>>I like sud, but we could avoid a final consonant by chosing austra, and
it

>>would be more consistent with boreo.  I don't feel strongly on this.

>>

*   I would like a little more rigor in the discussion on ending words 

with vowels.  Although it is a stated Glosa goal, I am not sure if it has
to be an article of faith, or a principle followed in all 
circumstances.


>>> >baka, koku  .....  kokus  ~~~~~ [berry]

>>

>>Prefer baka, sounds more beautiful for some reason.  Don't like the
final s on kokus.  I admit I'm being subjective here.

>>

*   Nothing wrong with subjectivity if it is backed up with some sort of
reasoning.  Id say ~baka~ is in - for reasons of beauty.


>>> >feli, felis  ....  feli  === I see it as the diminutive form

>>Yes, I prefer feli over felis

>>

*   ~Feli~ in.


>>> >festa, libe-tem .  libe-tem  ~~~~~ [free time, holiday]

>>

>>libe-tem could be like luchtime at work, whereas festa could be a
holiday

>>proper

>>

*   At present, I would prefer to concentrate on keeping the lexicon
short, and would rather not make ad hok additions to the lexicon.


>>> >gra, gramini  ..  gramini [grass]; gra [X-grass] (diminutive)

>>I don't understand this.

>>

*   EG Ciano-gra [Blue grass], fago-gra [fodder grass]


>>> >grafo, skribe  .  grafo  ~~~~~ [write]

>>

>>Do we need to distinguish handwriting from typing or even speech
recogition?

>>grafo ~~~~~~ [write by finger, pen, typewriter]

>>skribe ~~~~~~ [write by any means, eg speech recognition]

>>

*   Very possibly, but I don't think now is the time for it.  My feeling
is that the idea of getting information into a recorded, readable form is
enough for 2.5K.  We can be specific, if necessary, with ~rekorda~ for
sound and video.


>>> >hemi, semi  ....  hemi  ~~~~~ [half]

>>

>>Any use in having half-ish vs mathemtically 0.5 ???

>>

*   Yes.  But, later, after the dust settles, with the 2.5K circling the
globe, electronically, and the 6000+ happily stabilised.  There needs to
be a scheme for the addition of new lexical items, but that would be in
the next half-

thousand.  The authors created an _Advanced 5000 Technical Terms_, but
did not promote it when they found that most people were happy with the
shorter 1000 and 6000 lists.  


>>> >infra, hipo, sub ...  infra [under, below] ....  sub (synonym) +++

>>Hate sub with its final b.

>>

*   Easy decision: ~infra~ wins.

  

>>> >kine, ki  ....... kine [moving, movement]; ki [go] (auxiliary 
verb)

>>I always felt the need to distinguish translational from
nontranslational

>>movemnet.

>>

*   Agreed.  Feedback from others needed.  My experience is from trying
to use this (these) concept(s) while writing Glosa: my brain separated
movement into two distinct groups;  it also helped when I found KI and
KINE listed one under the other , with slightly different meanings in the
'Glosa 1000 - English' section of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.  However,
I felt that it did NOT actually help towards further concept definition,
when I found, in the larger part of _Glosa 6000_

Kinesi moving

Kineti moving

 

>>> >malus, pomi  .... malus [pear]; pomi [apple]

>>Don't like the -s at all.  Sorry.

>>

*   We can all agree on ~pomi~ but might keep a waiting brief on the
matter of all the rest of the world's eating pleasures .. at least until
a scheme is decided upon for the derivation of the common names of fruits
- possibly from their botanical Genus names.


>>> >mana, matina  ... matina [morning]; -mana (as part of compounds)

>>Is this complexity really needed?

>>

*   Possibly not; ~mana~ could be a quaintly formed dininutive for
compound formation, EG seti-mana [week (seven-morn)].


>>> >pan, panto  .... panto [all]; pan (brief form).

>>One or the other please.

>>

*   ~pan~ it is then.  Maybe ~panto~ can be revived in the Glosa++
edition to provide the emphatic, non-exclusive version of "all".


>>> >po, post  ...... posto[in
rear,afterwards];post[afterwards];po[after]

>>Don't like post.  Sorry.

>>

*   Easy: ~post~ having a terminal consonant, and being one diminutive
too many, is out!


>>> >porta, janu  ... janua  ~~~~~ [door, doorway]

>>Check for typo here.

>>

*   Well, in _6000_ it is JANUA [door, entrance], and in the
Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary it is <bold>Door </bold>ianua.


>>> >qo numera?,qanto? qo numera[how many(countables)];qanto[h.m.
uncount]

>>> >qo-horo?, qo-di? . qo-horo [when?, what's the time?]; qo-di [w.
day?]

>>> >qo-mode?, komo? . qo-mode  ~~~~~ [how, which way]

>>

>>Either qo or qo-.  Is qanto really needed??

>>

*   Probably right about the hyphen: it should follow a simple rule, and
I feel that it is better included.  The COUNT/UNCOUNT idea is definitely
in Functional 

Grammar, and seems valid unless it is only the British who are so
conscious of the difference between EG, flour (uncount) and bags of flour
(count).

  Qo-numera de spatula tu vo habe mi loka epi u tabla?

 (how-many  of  spoons you wish to have me locate on the table)


  Qanto sukra tu uti te face u mo kilo-gram plaka?

 (how much sugar you use to make a one kilogram cake) 


>>> >rubi-xanto, orange . rubi-xanto  ~~~~~ [orange]

>>I prefer orange.

>>

*   Well, OK.  According to the rules of pronunciation of Glosa, it could
be shown as: orange - (oran-gay), or, in Gaskell phonetics,
OR-r-AH-n'g-AY.

    Among participants is there available an electronic working
version of the "Glosa 2.5K" wordlist, even without the rough
edges smoothed out and the various decisions made (word pairs,
terminal vowels, and what not)?  If we were all playing from
the same sheet of music, the orchestra might sound better.

     So there could be one or two more here:-

    The Glosa authors know that the Net is hugely important, but they have
not had the grunt^ to organise "Applets" nor the money to pay for
significant connect-time.
    And pragmatically, per Pound Sterling spent on Third World vs. Internet
communication, they get more pages of Glosa written by Third Worlders: I
can understand their putting their limited resources where their best
results comes from.

*   Good question!  Just imagine a large database, somewhere with
candidates for the "2.5K" down one side, and 'votes' in favour of inclusion
- in columns across.  (The number of columns will depend on the number of
Glosalist participants.)

    We ought to add 'missing' words to the 6000 list first; then, after
we've decided on the 6000+ list, we can 'vote' on the words in it .. on the
basis that every second word, at least, should go.

    Paul Bartlett would much rather have us start from a reasonable Glosa
1000 list and add to it.  While I agree this might even be the better way
to go, I do feel it is worthwhile to see the larger list, so we know what
we are excluding.

    Because the whole 6000+ list will be a very large file, it might be
necessary to split the list into a number of parts.  I suspect that having
two computer screens side by side, and building up a composite list with
preferences-for-inclusion marked, I could produce tables of preferences
(assuming the list is split up) for posting to the Glosalist.

    If you were Prime Minister of the United Nations OR grand poo-baa of
some fuzzy democratic world body, and you found the world you were
responsible for, in a mess, what vocabulary would you like to see used to
discus solutions to the problems, globally?

    I'd say we need to make our choices based on the percieved need to use
the words .. in the coming struggle for human survival.

    I disagree, which should be no surprise.  I have previously
expressed my opinion that Glosa 6000 should be used for nothing more
than a source-book to fill in any perceived gaps but otherwise whould
be put on the shelf to gather dust.  And I am still wondering about
the "Glosa 2.5K" Robin has referred to.  If every other word of "6000"
were to go, we would still be substantially above my size estimate for
a basic vocabulary.

    I will give a single example of what I mean.  Suppose some
reasonable group of people came to some sort of more or less amicable
agreement on the terminal-vowels problem and the Greek/Latin pairs
issue.  Then optimize the vocabulary to whatever size it might turn out
to be.  For the "Mechanics of Glosa" add some agreed-upon connected
text to the existing paradigmatic phrases and sentences (themselves
cleaned up, if necessary, for terminal vowels and Greek/Latin).

    That much done, which does not really seem to be so great, then 
on a time-available basis I would cheerfully update the Glosa Basic
Reference I have on the web.  But because it contains originally
copyrighted materials, would Clark&Ashby allow it?

Friends have web hosting (no dialup) at he.net
for approximately $20 per month. So, it is really
just silly NOT to have an official "www.glosa.org".
No need for fancy applets, just a *presence*
and some informative text and points of contact.
Many would contribute articles, sounds, etc.

I don't have strong specific feelings about lexicon.
So I'll designate as my proxy (pause while coin is
tossed -- wow, it balanced on one edge) that fellow
known as "Ailanto" to vote for me.

Well, it's a start. I've always liked Roget. Question:
is there a list of correspondences between Roget numbers
and the Glosa words?

I would take several well-known basic vocabularies and merge them.
The most essential 10000 (or less) would be bi-syllabic.
Then rely on "adjectives" or compounding to build most of the rest,
as Esperanto does successfully from a small core vocabulary (2000?).
Certain specialist multi-syllabic vocabularies could be defined
by experts if needed.

The basics should be compared with Roget (done!), Kanji,
Esperanto/Ido (with extra special attention to their
powerful word-building suffixes) and a few others.

Look here, RH has done most of the work already:

Method used:-
  . Decide approx. what I want to say,  
  . Check out all possible Glosa words for expressing the idea,
  . Consider the 'concept' meaning of each of the words, if poss.,
  . Try the sentence with what seems the most suitable of the possible words;
   & see what the sentence looks like,
   & hear what it sounds like,
   & observe what the sentence 'feels' like, kinesthetically, when it is
being enunciated,
   & assess the comfort rating of the tested sentence: accept if satisfactory,
  . Try the sentence with the other poss. words until one word passes the
test.

both a vowel pair and a consonont triple - making it difficult for some:

might ask subscribers to go through, either selecting their finalists or
eliminating their non-preferred words.  Posting these voting results back
to the list - or directly to me - a final melt-down could be made.  I
would, of course, democratically want to publish the results of subscribers
selections.
   From this result, a short list of 2000 - 2500 words could be selected,
and republished on the list for a final concensus from subscribers.

    There is no Net dictionary for Glosa in the Public Domain, at present.
This would represent the first Glosa dictionary that is freely available on
the Net.
    My understanding is that people wish to have a list that presents them
with few, or no, choices.  Yet they would like to have enough words to make
meaningful communication possible. 
    If the selection makes the language attractive enough, new learners are
likely to add to their vocabulary by getting the printed Glosa 6000
dictionary.

*   On proper names, the authors advise that a minimal change in lettering
be observed.  While "Africa" might become ~Afrika~ to conform with Glosa
pronunciation rules, "Mississippi" would remain ~Mississippi~ because it
cuts across no pronunciation rules, and looks more like the original than
*Misisipi*.
    With personal names, I have a little more trouble: There is NO Glosa
equivalent to the standard "J" sound of English.  In Glosa ~J~ is sounded
like the "Y" in "yond."  Probably we will have to say that "John" is either
~Djon~ or ~Jon~ (maybe ~John~) with that funny English "J" that is like
~dz~ - but not quite - plus a silent ~H~.
    The Glosa ~G~ provides a similar problem in that there is NO 'soft G',
so we get back to the mystery of the missing "J", again.  Will "George
Washington" be introduced to unsuspecting millions as 
gAY'ORrgAY wAHsEEn'tORn - with a silent G in the second word, but two hard
G's in the first?
   Are there any clues about handling this problem from other Planned
Languages?  Maybe we will just have to tell people that ~George Washington~
is pronounced "George Washington" because it comes from an ancient language
with very irregular spelling, and the English talk funny.
   Suggestions, anyone?

   On the question of specialist vocabularies, no: there has been no
activity.  BUT there should be some planning as to how to fit them in to
the existing structure of the language.
   We need to put effort into the basic use of the lenguage still, so have
no resources for specialist dictionaries.  also,such things need the
efforts of specialists!
   I can imagine that, one day, we will 'load up' additional vocabularies
to read specialist material using the terminology of one or more areas of
interest.  If the writer of an article uses teminology from specialist
lexicons, then he/she would indicate which vocabulary lists are needed if
people are going to word-process, machine-handle, or just plain make
dictionary reference.
   The analogy is given by Java programming: at the top of an applet, the
programmer calls up the subroutines he will need during the running of the
applet, EG p218 "Java Programming for Dummies"
 import java.awt.*;
 import java.applet.*;
 import java.lang.*;

   In a similar way specialist Glosa lexicons can be called up into RAM so
that they will be available for the word-processor, Machine-Translator or
dictionary-reader.  This would provide a limit, saying that while writing
the item, you were using words only from the stated list of lexicons.
Needless to say, particular terms outside the stated lists could be given
in an additional listing.

*   We all agree with the idea of a _Glosa by Example_ grammar book using
fully formed sentences to demonstrate the rules.  This can be worked on
concurrently with the creation of a Net Dictionary: there are scads of
words that are not in contention; these could be used to make up sentences
for a _Mechanics of Glosa_.
    In my mind, I have a list of the principles of Glosa's Syntax-based
Grammar, and I should outline them on this list so that other can comment,
ammend, etc.  Once such a list of principles is finalised to everyone's
satisfaction, then we could go to the next phase, of fleshing out the
principles with examples.
QUESTIONS:-
 . Is there a set of principles of Glosa's grammar?
 . If there is a set of Grammatical rules applying to Glosa can we produce
a definitive list?
 . Do people see a booklet (or webpage) with rules stated, then a series of
examples following each rule?
 . Or is there some thought of teaching by example only, without resort to
didacticism?

which the "Mechanics" are illustrated.  This would be more imaginative, but

her mother's former home.  I ought to print out, on paper, the key ideas to
send them, while their computer is still off the air.  The authors thought
that a grammar book would put people off, so discouraged action on this
some years ago.  Once we decide on the form of a "Mechanics" we should send
a copy of either the 'rules', or examples of some of the text, for checking.

    You have the idea.  Some sort of text narrative showing how it all
fits together.  For one thing, a connected text would demonstrate that
it is simply not necessary to mark everything under the sun all the
time as western European languages do.  There may be people whose
native languages do not mark tense all the time, and they may wonder
why Glosa is inflected like Latin if tense and aspect are always being
marked.  If they leave out the markers when they are not strictly
necessary, those who have become over-accustomed to marking everything
may have trouble understanding.  Also, a text narrative would give more
of the feel of the language than just isolated phrases and sentences. 
As for being "harder to do," if it is too hard, then that would mean
that it would be too hard to use Glosa at all.

I was thinking about this a little, and *IF* everyone wanted
to participate through the web using a browser, it would not be
difficult to write a little Perl/CGI script to display the
list with comments interspersed. Something like ...

>: (Glosa word 455) ...
>: (Glosa word 456) - (English translation)
>:    comment 1 - this word is excellent!
>:    comment 2 - this word is terrible!!
>: (Glosa word 457) - ...
...
>: Add your comment here: .........

If this is desired, I could make a mock-up page.
It could be kept "secret" so only our cabal sees it.

As I commented on AUXLANG, this problem really must
get resolved, and soon. The grammar is dangerously
under-specified. Is a given word to be a "verb" by
default? Then its dictionary entry had better say so.
Otherwise you must mark it. Mixed strategy is common,
but in Glosa it isn't even decided what the rules are.

Well, Peano did it in a famous address, changing Latin
to Latino Sin Flexione on the fly ...

Another way is to take the "GUM" and translate each idiom.

    For myself, it would be easier to have a flat ASCII file I
could download to my PC and consider/manipulate at my leisure. 
My web access is a little primitive, and last month my phone
bill was higher than expected due to greater online time.  I
could handle it several ways: a file sent out by email,
something stashed in an ftp library somewhere, or a bare
<pre>...</pre> web page I could print to a file and download.

    This is perhaps due to Clark&Ashby's individual predilection. 
They seem to have an aversion to anything that smacks of formal
grammar.  Witness their absurd claim (perhaps not made of late) that
"Glosa has no grammar."  From a communication I once received from one
of them, I got the idea that they -deliberately- do not participate
in IAL exchanges such as AUXLANG and don't even try to satisfy the
wants of "formal scholarship."  They seem to think that informality
and non-specification will carry the world.  Sorry, but I don't buy
it.  I have to some extent changed my thinking on something like the
paedagogy of Glosa (or whatever), but I agree that the grammar is
under-specified.  There seems to be the dangerous unritten, unspoken
precept, "Otherwise do it as in English."

    I wonder if this is so in all cases.  Contemporary English swaps
words around among parts of speech, and the marking is a little flimsy
at times.

    To some extent I agree.  I do not think that the basic structure
needs to be changed.  I just think that it needs some cleaning up and
better specification.

    Quite a long time ago, Robin sent me a grammar specification
he had worked up.  I sent it back with comments, but as I recall
I generally thought it was a good start.  Unfortunately, my copy
has apparently fallen to long-ago disk housecleaning.  But if
Robin still has it (especially with my comments, of course :-) ),
it might be something of worth.

It isn't that I mind their flying in the face of linguistic
scholarship that really bothers me; it's the practical issues
that arise, such as your desire to minimize the pseudo-articles
and such, and are not plainly answerable except by force of
numbers ("let usage decide").

I found what appears a very reasonable description of how
lexical categories are marked (or not) in real languages:
*** http://www.epas.utoronto.ca/~dbeck/lextheory.HTML ***
and I would like to know which of the 4 possible language
types Glosa wants to be.

Any one of the basic types would be OK, but would have
implications. Then we could be secure in our understanding
of how "u/plu" should work, etc. This would be A Good Thing.

It is accounted for neatly by the theory (URL)
above. English is both "Head/dependent sensitive"
and "Predicate/object sensitive", so it has distinct
lexical classes of noun, adjective, or verb for all
the open-class words. By default, a given word is, say,
a verb, but can become an adjective by adding a suffix
like "-ing". In contrast, Tagalog is negative on both;
so function must always be marked. EXCEPT that when
"obvious", elision is possible -- all langs do that.

Or we could "let usage decide", which isn't going
to work out well, since influence of the native lang
will decide it differently in each case. And if we
default to English, then every word must be default-
marked as to part of speech in the dictionary;
I think nobody here wants that. Or ... ??!?!!

Yes, I can agree with that statement, except that
the word "just" is the nastiest word in English.
In other words, it really has to be done, and
might not be easy at all.

    My position has been that markers should be used only when
necessary for disambiguation.  However, I am open to it being
demonstrated that markers may be necessary more frequently than 
I have hitherto thought.

    One problem I have had is that without a more consistent,
agreed-upon vocabulary (including one sufficient to discuss Glosa 
in Glosa), I have been reluctant to put more effort into "original"
composition and discussion thereof.  And for me, wordlists pretty 
much need to be manipulable offline with an editor (not, e.g.,
restricted to the web).

Thank you for that vote of confidence! And also thanks for all the
URLs you've been passing on to us.

Paul has remarked on the overuse of markers in English and the tendency
of this overuse to migrate into Glosa. We agree that markers should not
be used when the information is redundant. For example, above... since
I'm replying on 26 Dec. to a message that charles sent on 25 Dec., it is
sufficient to say "charles skribe" rather than "charles pa skribe".

As I've said before, one of the things I like about Glosa but probably
want to push further than the authors had in mind is this idea of concept
words. But if a word can be a noun, verb, adjective, whatever, then the
use of markers can be of even greater importance than they might be in
other languages. Consider the sentence "A B C D E F G". Even knowing
that it's in Glosa, headfinal and all that, if each of those words A
through G could represent any part of speech, how could we possibly know
where the subject ends and the verb begins? But we also know that even
in Glosa there are words that will never be used as verbs (though I will
certainly try!), so, as charles noted, knowledge of which words can and
cannot be which parts of speech would certainly aid in the parsing, and
I'm sure that much of this will come relatively simply and automatically.
But if these words and their allowable parts of speech must be learned,
would this not be a hindrance to learning and usage, and does it not
tarnish the idea of concept words?

My feeling is that while truly redundant markers should and will
disappear, some others will pop up to resolve ambiguous situations,
and in so doing may appear to introduce redundancy in other ways,
though their true purpose is not redundancy.

Just a quick comment on synonyms. Though it's been a while since I looked
closely, I do recall that there were many words in the lexikon which were
synonymous if their parts of speech were ignored. We should probably be
paring down these synonyms too, though this process would be pushing us
closer to my ideal of the concept-word language, and might thus actually
cause more trouble with parsing.

And I'll also point out one example that simultaneously intrigues and
disturbs me...

   U tri feli...   The three cats...

   U feli tri...   The third cat...

Intrigues, because it's so concept-wordy. Disturbs, because I don't think
I would have come up with a "catty third" on my own. (And I'm still not
sure that I like this form. It doesn't seem quite robust enough but I can't
quite say why. Anyway...) Maybe with practice, and certainly with a hint -
but no way would I have come up with that on my own! We *do* need a grammar!

*   In a short answer: no there is no reason why an interested Glosa-pe
cannot take over some of the Glosa work on the Net!
    On this, I personally am guided by the existing range of words in
existing, printed Glosa dictionaries.  If a word is there, but is part of a
range of spellings, then, when a good case is given for preferring the one
over the others, it becomes the chosen form.
    Regarding synonyms, it is obvious that both words are usable, buti it
just becomes a matter of selection, to choose the most suitable one for use
in the Net dictionary.
    I try to avoid inventing words that are not in the printed
dictionaries, or have been printed at one time.  EG ~utor~ [employ] this
word was derived by me from the Latin dictionary; and, considering that I
wanted to use the concept "employ", which was not covered by the Glosa
6000, I simply derived the word using the same process that the authors
would have used.
    A more difficult case is the logical function-word "that": I and others
use this 'archaic' form in our thinking and speech, EG "It was so cold that
he died."  In Glosa this used to be ~ke~ [that], but this Esperanto
'loan-word' was dropped, and Wendy pointed out to me that I was using Old
Glosa.
  EG  U meteo habe ta frigo; ke un andra pa morta.
 glos. the weather had so much cold, that the man did die

   This usage was shortened from  ~ ; ke ~  to  ~ ; ~ .   I did not enjoy
this death of a word, nor of the sounding of the concept.  I have seen in
some Glosa the use of ~u-la~ to express the logical function, when it means
"the there".
   I miss this word and wish to see it re-instated in the Glosa dictionary.

*   Nice idea.  Please discus your intention: I understand that you wish to
avoid using sentences that a unrelated to others, and thus 'lifeless'.  In
a few words, can you describe the final effect that you wish to achieve.
    And yes, the Glosa authors are not rushing in to set up a whole
narative demonstrating all of the points of Glosa's grammar, so, if you or
I don't do it, it is likely not to get done.

    If Fred prints the "Xingalong Dictionary" and Harry photocopies it and
reprints it, as it stands, then Harry has infringed Fred's copyright.
Even if Harry retypes the Xingalong List exactly and sells it or gives it
away, then Fred probably has a case in court against Harry.  But once Harry
starts creatively playing with the Xingalong List extending it, or
shortening it, then Fred's lawyer might warn him that he is likely to lose,
if he takes Harry to court. The rule might be that you can copyright a
dictionary, but you can't copyright a language.  
    One last thought.  Fred needs to pay his lawyer: without the ^green
folding^ there is no case!

*   Q1: No.  But there aren't many others doing things.  I, for instance,
asked to be Glosa agent for Australia, and they suggested "Glosa Agent for
NSW".  
     I suggested a Glosa Supergroup comprising the activists, wherever they
were: the main response was that the authors couldn't work out how to
administer such a group.  I was on Conlang and Auxlang for some years
before I decided that I should try to establish a Glosa Mailing List.
     "Delegation of authority" has been a theme in my letters with the
authors, but they seem to have been a bit slow responding to this idea.  I
have strongly recommended that they set up a clear Management Structure
together with a solid Business Plan for Glosa, and there was some movement.
 I have slowed down a bit because of health, but am picing up speed again.

    But it is agreed, Clark and Ashby do not own Glosa, and anyone else can
set up a Glosa publication, Webpage or Mailing List.  But, I have seen
nothing of other administration in Glosa beyond mine and that of Banobi
Herbert of the Mountain Gorilla Park in Uganda.  Originally an Oden Smith
did run a good structure of Glosa groups in Uganda, but sadly
he died, and no-one has taken up his mantle.
    As far as I am concerned, Glosa can start breaking out like grass-fires
all over.  There should, by now, be a network of Glosa Mailing Lists: I
wish there were.
    Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby might be a genii, but they still have things
to learn about running a business.

*   When I originally registered "Glosa Communication" as a trading name,
they were a bit surprised.  The Bahai, Paul Easton, released the Glosa
Classified list (1000 words) because it seemed the sensible thing to do.  I
agreed that his action was correct, but had been asked not to release Glosa
6000 on the Net prior to this.
    There are restrictions but they are based on pre-electronic publishing
principles.  One reason for my starting the Glosalist was to gather a
concensus for releasing a Glosa Internet Dictionary.  It is an idea whose
time has come, even if the Glosa authors do not know it.  At 62, and with
one stent, I have decided to do the right thing rather than the allowed
thing: having spent twenty years with Glosa, it is no wonder that I
sometimes lapse into Old Glosa.  Also, I could retire from active language
promotion ... or could keep promoting Glosa: I might as well give it my
best shot, considering I don't know how long I can continue doing so.

would have until I start looking.
    One thing that is, however, certain is that I was unhappy with Glosa
when I was restricted to the shorter, Glosa 1000 dictionary.  It was only
after the Glosa 6000 was published that I discovered the elegance of Glosa,
and found that I could express myself as I wished.  So, for my own
purposes, I do not know how much of the 6000 list I could comfortably do
without.  If you add to Glosa 1000, and I cut from Glosa 6000, we will meet
somewhere at the median point.
    And here's the cruncher.  For economic reasons the authors prefer to
disseminate Glosa via the Glosa 1000 list.  If others felt the same
restriction that I got from this list, it might easily suggest that others
failed to get satisfaction from this shorter list, too.  I dreamt of using
DTP to create further copies of Glosa 6000, and now with the P2 and an
Epson Stylus 440, I might be able to do this ... for free dispersal to Africa.

>>>> So, I hope that others set up Glosa groups all around the world.
     The Ownership of the 1000 and 6000 lists is with the Glosa Educational
Organisation, which is a charity in U.K.
     A Net dictionary will be also marked with the GEO copyright, but this
will have little real effect, since no-one will be inclined to send a
"Registration" to Richmond, UK, though an invitation to this effect will be
extended.

A wonderful way of putting it! I doubt there are very many people

I think you're right about that legal distinction, dictionary vs.
language. But the real question is, what's the right thing to do?
Quite frankly, while I'd never hesitate to violate a Microsoft
copyright (considering what they've done to my computing world)
I wouldn't want to work against Ashby and Clark even if I had the
legal right to do so.

Maybe it's time to do a Loglan/Lojban type spinoff. We could almost
claim a new language simply by defining the grammar!

So it's back in, because "ke/that" is indispensible for clear
writing and speech. I would eliminate ";" instead.

So a new dictionary is OK to produce and distribute,
even if it disagrees with the A&C canon.

Ack! you mean "dialect". Yes, the "internet dialect" of Glosa.

    How do other languages handle this sort of subordination?  "It 
was so cold that the old man died."  Here, "that" is a conjunctive
expressing result or causation.  Elsewhere in English, "that" often
merely introduces a noun clause.  English "that" is a slippery word,
just like the abominable "get."  I do not think we should introduce
these ambiguities into Glosa.

Klima es ta frigi; seqe-co gero-an gene morta.

Forget 'ke'/"that" in such a case.

    Why should they have to administer such a group at all?  My
consideration is that the best think Zamenhof ever did for Esperanto
was to take his hands off of it.  He remained the exemplar of good
usage and answered a lot of questions, but he unequivocally put it 
the public domain.  A very, very wise decision, in my estimation.  
And he did not get rich off of Esperatno, either.

    Management Structure?  Business Plan?  Why not just let is spread
without a lot of bureaucracy?  James Cooke Brown tried to keep a
stranglehold on Loglan and succeeded only in running up large legal
fees in a messy court battle he eventually lost.  Eiffel, I am told,
was a relatively good computer programming language, but the author
tried to keep a stranglehold on it, and now it is probably pretty much
dead.  As harsh as it may sound, Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby are going 
to have to realize that if they tie Glosa to their personal lives,
including their personal finances, its future is bleak at best.

    Plausible notion.

    Except that there is -NO- "Glosa 1000" list.  Their published lists
of "Glosa 1000" are inconsistent, which has been a point of mine all
along.

    This sounds like a blurring between copyrighting a language and
copyrighting a document.  If a language cannot be copyrighted but much
of its content -- vocabulary lists -- can, then the practical effect
of the language not being copyrighted is largely vitiated.

    Keep the existing paradigmatic phrases and sentences in the
Mechanics of Glosa (perhaps conflated from its various forms, as I
tried to do on the www pages).  They are fine as far as they go and
usefully demonstrate a lot of usages.  But taken in isolation they do
not give a subjective "feel" for the language nor demonstrate how it
fits together on a larger scale.

    Nice to hear that you are not anxious about the dictionary.  But to
keep everyone happy, we may as well fix on a standard vocabulary with
regular spelling.  After recovering from dictionaritis, we will be able to
get on with the task of using the language creatively.

*   No, words were never intended to BE parts of speech, but to function as
different parts of speech, depending on their syntax, and it has always
been so.  
 EG An ki habe u kurso.  ........ kurso  [run] 'noun' = functions as noun
    An kurso longi u via.  ...... kurso  [run] 'verb' = functions as verb

   Some words by their very semantics find it hard to function as anything
else but a verb, and others as a noun, but the rule is just as fresh today
as it was twenty years ago:- 
  "A word may, within reason, function as any part of speech, depending on
its syntax.

*   Hello Ron and Wendy,
     I won't know if you get this message, but Ido hope your computer is
now operational again.
     Charles mentions that there are a number of "free sites" around the
Net, and that there are some minimal cost deals, as well.  I would pay
half, if necessary, to ensure that you could put out a Webpage.

    The "2.5K" idea is for the setting up of a Net dictionary that is put
into the Public Domain, so that it is freely available to allcomers.  I do
like the 6000 word-list, but Paul Bartlett and a few others prefer a
shorter First Dictionary, so we will do a compilation of 2000 - 2500 words
to get the Cyberions in.

    It looks like it will be a bit tricky to work through a
cyberspace-committee to reduce the Glosa 6000 to a third of its bulk.  But
there were three things suggesting the need for a recast:-
  . spelling irregularities throughout the 6000 and various 1000 lists,
  . a surplus of synonyms - or simply the presence of synonyms,
 &. the stated desire for a Starter Dictionary shorter than the 6000, but
longer than the 1000.

    These matters have prevented the Glosalist subscribers from actively
writing in Glosa up to now.  Well, agreed, they didn't stop me, but I must
be tough or thick skinned.  If the Glosalist subscribers are any measure of
the affluents in cyberspace, then we must be doing something wrong, because
very few of those connected to the Net have transcribed stories into Glosa:
I have seen none from other computer-owners yet.
     Considering the Internet is an open forum, and anyone anywhere with a
Network connection can trawl the Net to find my Webpage, I would say that
the members of Auxlang, and especially the members of the Glosalist, are at
the leading edge of World Language Reform; so, we ought to be able to
'catch' some of them, at least.  If these open-minded souls are acting shy,
then we have little hope of drawing in the less-interested majority of
humanity ... with the present offering.
     "Standardisation" is the catch-word behind the "2.5K" idea.  I now am
convinced that there is much less ''suspension of judgment'' around than we
had hoped for.  It looks as if the educated intelligentsia using the
Internet has effectively been taught to dot all it "I"s and cross all its
"T"s, and to reject work that fails to measure up to this prescribed standard.
     I am trying hard to distil a shorter Net Dictionary, with no spelling
irregularities and virtually NO synonyms: hopefully such a dictionary will
allow our potential Glosa-pe on the Net to discover their creativity, at
last.  
     For myself, I still recommend Glosa 6000 for creative purposes, and I
enjoy the luxury of being able to call "water" variously ~aqa~ or ~hidra~;
but, my values are not those of the majority of Glosalist subscribers, so,
for the sake of results, I feel it necessary to bend my effort to the
concensus view.

Saluta, 
 Robin Gaskell
  P.S. Wendy, how has the house-selling gone?

vocabularies ... and you would aim to find the bi-syllabic "conceptual

words with either  CVCV or CV-CV structure?  The latter technique was used
to define the various consonant-vowel doubles that were the building blocks
of the Huna language (CV-CV-CV-CV).

    Thank you for this inspiration, Paul.

    Quite frankly this is an ideal opportunity for Glosalistas who would be
Glosa-pe to get started.
 
    Now, there are a number of features of Glosa grammar that could be
demonstrated in the body of a text | narative | description | etc.

    It might be possible to introduce and repeat a grammatical principle in
one installment, and then introduce and repeat another in a subsequent
installment, and so on.  Is this idea of a serialised story what you had in
mind, Paul?

    The alternative device is to treat quite different situations in
subsequent texts, choosing situations in which one grammatical principle
can occur a number of times.  This is the more standard Grammar book trick.
 And it would suit us on the Glosalist if different people chose to create
various texts featuring this, or that, grammatical principle.

    For reasons of group spirit, I would prefer it if we could work,
co-operatively, on the various installments of a connected narative, using
the same heros and heroines who keep cropping up in different (grammatical)
situations.
    Having happy memories of the other-ness of French culture from Franch
lessons, at school, I imagine a Fifi and a Herbert (pronounced in Glosa, of
course) being our major protagonists.  We'll need another couple of
Cosmopolitans to flesh out the plot, and then we'll need a reason for
telling the tale.  What action do we want in the story: a bank robbery, a
traffic accident, a traumatic lottery win, etc, OR all of the above, and more?

    Paul, did you imagine this as primarily a Mailing List sequence, or as
something that would fit an episode onto a page for printing and mailing ..
or both?  I still have to learn how to use the Word97/Epson440
pair in DTP mode, and if I abbr. my blips I might get time to study the new
equip.
    I have imagined that the various grammatical principles can be noted in
a margin left for such comments.  If this ran down the RHS of the page, it
could even be marked off with a vertical line.  If used, would we wish to
give the Grammar its Glosa name, or would we use English?  I favour Glosa
on the page - with a key at the end of the book giving English equivalents,
and leaving space for the pen additions of language-X equivalents.
    
   Right, gang: we need more names, and situations you might be happy to
write grammatical sequences about.

Hedo Nov-anua,
 Robin Gaskell
   P.S.  Hands up all those who would like a thumb-nail sketch of the
points of Glosa grammar that ought to come up in our Demo-narative.
       If we like doing the first one, we might do another, etc.

Time is the problem, indeed ... the only one worse than money.
I could donate a share of the cost too.

They allow you to install "Smartlist", which looks pretty good:
ftp://ftp.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/pub/packages/procmail/SmartList.FEATURES
But I have not tried it myself.

I don't think fancy features are needed, but here they are:

With a hosting service, the costs are not hidden;
and no ads, and high performance (unlike Geocities).

I think it *is* very important, but I trust you guys to do it.
I'm not strong on lexicon myself; I'd just pick Ido words.
They did a very good job ... look at this:

    Uh, no, as a matter of fact.  I was thinking of just a long
paragraph or two is all.  I generally like the overall purpose of 
the existing booklets.  I only think that they need to be expanded
somewhat: enhanced and regularized vocabulary, perhaps with the
categorizations at the end (which might, of course, entail some
repetition) together with the Mechanics expanded to include a connected
paragraph or two.  Pretty much like the current Glosa Basic Reference
on the www.  It could still be printed up as a booklet -- in various
languages, of course -- only somwhat, but not greatly, larger than the
existing booklets.  They would be relatively cheap to produce (compared, 
say, to a book, even paperbound).

    To the best of my knowledge, SmartList is one of the simplest
mailing list servers to administer (compared, say, to Majordomo,

Glosa has 2 major advantages over other IALs;
it has SVO analytic type (known to be the easiest)
and it uses CV phonology (ditto). CV implies there
will be approximately 100 distinct syllables,
so there can be a maximum of 10000 bi-syllabic words.
That should more than suffice for an easy-to-learn
yet complete vocabulary, assuming that users can
easily compound or "adjectivize" (use modifiers).

No, these are the basic phrases needed for real-life speech.
They could serve as the basis for a useful phrase-book,
a non-"grammatical" approach like (but more rigorous than)
the paltry Glosa examples given currently ...

xxx IS A yyy ............ a tomato is a plant
THERE IS xxx ............ there's a bug on the tomato plants
xxx'S yyy, yyy OF xxx ... the plant's fruit, fruit of the plant
xxx IS CALLED yyy ....... this tomato is a Hogben's Folly

And so on. These are the basic idioms of *any* language.
Unless they are specified, it will be "as in English",
which is not a serious option at all!

Again, using previous research is not a tedious chore,
it is a labor-saving device and ensures success.

Every language has the ability to use words of one class
as another, by some mechanism. It is OK to avoid the terms
"verb" and "noun" in teaching, but it would be silly to claim
Glosa does not have them; there are NO languages without them.
Some langs do not have true adjectives; I think it is clear
that Glosa DOES, as in English but unlike Chinese.

Then, word-order determines class. This implies
that particles must mark the phrase transitions,
like the dashes in "subject-verb-object".

Also, hyphenation is the way of modifying modifiers when there
are more than one (otherwise word order is insufficient).

I disagree ... And it is poor strategy,
making Glosa lean on a natlang for support.

So really, like Chinese, Glosa has 2 classes of words,
the open class of verbs/nouns/modifiers or "full words",
and the closed class of particles or "empty words".

If it does run through the Mailing List - is not too big - then I can
imagine using Galaxy macros to rule up a table ... 6000 rows long (?!?)

    So, if some Glosalistas sent in tricky sentences - in English or Glosa
- where the need for "disambiguation" is arguable, I would have a go at
maintaining their non-ambiguity with 'elegance', by rendering them into
what seems passable Glosa to me ... with, or without, the "U" and "PA".

'test' the language
beyond the dictionary level, anyway.  _Cinerala_ for example, might have
some odd spellings, and could contain a bit of Old Glosa, but basically it
can be understood well by the average educated person armed with a Glosa 6000.
    You want to write from a position of subjective certainty about the

    It is the logical nature of English sentence construction that might be
a criterion for Glosa. 
   But it would now seem that the style of Glosa's grammar is ^loose, and
flapping^, and needs to be tied down securely.
   I guess that I saw this problem coming, back in 1994, when I attempted a
description of the grammar.  And it looks as if it's time to revive such
thoughts (V1.3 sent to Glosalist).

    If your system prevents the reception of "Attachments" but you want
this file, I will find a way of getting it to you.

   SBG V1.3 is simply a description of how Glosa is supposed to work,
syntactically.  I have added a few items that are not official "Richmond"
rulings.  However, because the Glosa authors have shied away from
publishing a Grammar-Book, the SBG.GLS is something that I had to compile
from distributed data in the Glosa publications and from personal experience.

   Re Old Glosa: The authors introduced a number of features , which have
since been discontinued.  Two, that I am loathe to see go, are the 'logical
"that"' ~ke~, and the Past Perfect tense particle [= had] ~pra~.  On

    I have download the "v1.3" grammar document to my own system and
can hash it over on a time-available basis.  In the meantime, I will
respond to one paragraph.

    I am not at all clear by what you mean by a "logical" 'that'.  In
English, 'that' has a multitude of uses.  Which one or ones are you
talking about?  Most frequently when I have seen you use it, you were
using the equivalent of a 'that' which introduces an English noun
clause.  However, in the example which came up the other day, 'that'
was used very differently and in such a way that I think an entirely
other construct should be used in Glosa.  'That' is about as slippery
as 'get', and idiosyncratic English usages should -not- be ported over
with all their confusions into an auxlang.

    As for 'pra', why does Glosa have to ape the confusing English
tense structure, which also tends to confuse tense and aspect.  Just
listen to a lot of Russian adult learners of English and their
dfifficulties with English tense structure.  Russian, to the best of my
knowledge, differentiates much more clearly than does English between
tense and aspect.  The English past perfect tense tends to blend a
perfective aspect and a past tense.  I am -not- in favor of 'pra'.  Are
you letting yourself be unduly influenced by English again?

This gets into ambiguous modifiers ...
The infamous "pretty little girl".
Then: "a pretty little girl school".
It can get even worse in German.

I suppose the answer is to use hyphenation plus
genitive particles plus conjunctions. A definite
article might help if there were any, but there
aren't. That's OK with me, one should be able to
use "some" "same" "any" and that sort of more
specific quantifying modifier to much better effect.

I think the result is going to be that any noun
phrase over 3 words long will need a heavy pause
at the end. If we had any French speakers, they
might prefer to use a more theme-rheme style here:
"The pretty little girl school, it is big." ...
versus "The pretty little girl school is big."

Then there is the multiple preposition phrase:
"I saw the man chasing the cat with a broom
in underwear".

Then there's the direct/indirect transition:
"I sent it to him but he gave her something else".

Now one of my favorites, "He was red, she was a Red".
Well, you said no part-of-speach marking allowed ...

(These are just warm-up, practice problems.)

Relative clauses do need to be defined or proscribed;
pidgins often don't have them. Rick Morneau says:
ftp://ftp.eskimo.com/u/r/ram/conlang/Syntax
(and actually, he says it all ...)

I think you are correct, but I don't have a good URL
that describes the near-universal pidgin aspect system.
Glosa's is already more complex than that. Certainly
past and perfect should not be combined in one particle.
Ido, after much resistance, did eventually add both a
passive (like "gene"?) and perfective suffix/particle, IIRC.

I was thinking of accumulating all the comments
in a separate file, like this ...

	BAZAR	CAG	cool
	BDELA	CAG	no way
	BAZAR	RG	keep
	BASANO	RG	too abstruse

But on the web page, the comments would be merged
into the selected set of words, and formatted nicely;
there would be a form at the bottom like so:

	Glosa word(s): .............
	Your comment: .....................
	Your initials: ....

But, too many people don't want to sit around on-line
in the browser. I have unlimited cheap access so
for me the browser is *the* interface of choice.

Maybe the thing to do, then, is just have people
mail Robin directly with their "kill/keep" lists.
It would be nice to list one word per line so
it is easily sortable by the "sort" utility
(which I believe still exists in M$DOS in some form).

    Definitely.

> Ido, after much resistance, did eventually add both a

    However, in Ido they are distinct suffixes, '-ab-' for 
perfective and '-is' for past.  Glosa already has a sort-of 
inmperfective particle, 'du'.  One could, I suppose, use the 
opposition formant 'no-' to create '*no-du' as a perfective 
particle, although I am not overly thrilled about that.  Some 
conIALs use an adverb meaning roughly "already" as a sort of 
quasi-perfective.  Glosa has 'pre-nu' for "already," but the 
'-nu' conveys some meaning of currentness of time, so I wouldn't 
think it would be all that suitable as a perfective.

    I occasionally use a freeware sort for DOS which is much 
more powerful than the clunky sort that comes wiht DOS itself.

But "ja" is aleady taken and has the wrong sound.

    Whenever possible I am in favor of trying to use already existing
resources instead of making words up.  As for the aspect particles
generally, I plan soon to post some comments about Robin's grammar
statement.  I have to give fair warning that I am not gentle with the
overall verb system -description-, not most of the verb system as such,
which I think can be generally workable if concepts are sorted out.  In
fact, I think that a perfective marker is the only major thing lacking
in the Glosa verb system.

    SYNTAX-BASED GRAMMAR  OF  GLOSA        with no Part-of-Speech markers)

{ Strictly speaking, no part-of-speech markers as components of words
{ themselves.  'U(n)/plu' mark substantives.
 _________________________________________________________________________

_____>>>  1. Basic Structure

      A. The phrase is the unit of the language.

{ I thought that words are the units of a language (except in so-called
{ polysynthetic languages in which even the concept of "word" is a
{ little blurry).

         i. There are:- noun phrases
                        verb phrases
                        adverbial phrases &
                        adjectival phrases

        ii. Within a phrase, a word is modified by its precedent, and
             there is a gradual increase in significance, i.e. the
             first word is least significant, with words increasing in
             significance to the last word, which is the most significant.

{ What about the particles 'u(n)/plu'?  They may appear in a multi-word
{ phrase but apply generally to the final word of the phrase, not to the
{ immediately succeeding word.

      B. Phrases combine to form a sentence (major clause) comprising:-

{ In normal terminology, a sentence may consist solely of a major
{ clause, but "sentence" and "major clause" are distinct.  Most
{ importantly, does Glosa even NEED an elaborate clause structure?

               a. one clause (the Major Clause) OR

               b. clauses (Main & Subordinate Clause[s]) (= Major Clause)

{ What is the equal sign referring to here?  Why does "(= Major Clause)"
{ even appear under this item?

         i. Subordinate clauses may be:- adverbial clauses &
                                         adjectival clauses

{ Why no noun clauses?

        ii. Within a clause, the sequence is:- Subject, Verb, [Object].

             A Major Clause comprises:-

               a. Noun Phrase - Verb phrase - Noun Phrase
                                                  - with a transitive verb

{ In some languages, such as English, a noun phrase can follow a
{ verb without being an object: the so-called predicate nominative,
{ which complements the verb but refers to the subject without being
{ an object of the verb.

               b. Noun Phrase - Verb Phrase
                   OR   Noun Phrase - Verb Phrase - Dependent Phrase
                                            (usually an Adverbial Phr.)
                                               - with an intransitive verb

{ Could be an adjectival phrase as a predicate adjective:  "The house
{ next door appears red to me."  "U para-domi feno es rubi per u vide."
{ "Red"/'rubi' is a single-word predicate adjectival phrase as a
{ predicate modifier of the subject.  (In these instances I will agree
{ that 'u' is appropriate.)

      C. Phrases and clauses can be combined to form a Major Clause.

         i. An Adverbial Clause follows immediately after the verb or Verb
             Phrase it modifies, with a colon (:) marking the start of the
             clause, and a comma(,) indicating its completion.

{ This is the first time I recall seeing use of a colon in this context.
{ The whole issue of punctuation in Glosa may need to be revisited.
{ The written form of a language is a crystallization, so to speak, of
{ speech.  Lojban has "verbal punctuation," but I don't know how to
{ speak some of this punctuation in Glosa.}

        ii. An Adjectival Clause follows immediately after the noun or Noun
             Phrase it qualifies, with a semi-colon (;) marking the start
             of the clause, and a comma (,) indicating its completion.

{ See above for predicate adjectival phrases.

       iii. Clauses and phrases, if elided (with function words omitted),
             are still treated as the full phrase or clause .. for purposes
             of syntax analysis .. and the necessary punctuation is used.

_____>>>  2. Precedence
              RULE: A word or phrase is modified by its precedent.

{ This is merely a duplication of 1.A.ii above.

      D. i. In the Major Clause, there is a tendency for the first noun
             phrase (subject) to modify the verb phrase, and then the verb
             phrase modifies the second noun phrase (object).

{ I have never heard of subjects "modifying" verbs, nor of verbs
{ "modifying" objects.

        ii. In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-
             determinant - number - quantity - modifier(s) - noun
              Note. the concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

{ Incidentally, concept and word are NOT the same thing.  Using them
{ interchangeably just contributes to the notion that the presentation
{ of Glosa is sloppy.  And a sloppy presentation will cause a lot of
{ people not to take the language seriously -- and not just professional
{ linguists, either.

       iii. In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
             tense particle - negative - modifier - auxiliary verb -
                                              verb OR verboid + amplifier

{ Why not negative before tense particle?  As for "verboid," I have
{ never encountered this term outside of Interglossa and Glosa.  It
{ seems not to be well definded.

              Again. the concept/word used as a verb is the only element
              of a verb phrase that is essential.

_____>>>  3. Function Words
              These introduce clauses, give logical relationships between
               clauses; negatives, interrogatives and conjunctions.

{ What about 'u(n)/plu', which in recent discussions have been referred
{ to as function words?  The terminology needs to be tightened up some
{ here.

      E. Clauses that follow the words they qualify:-

         i. An adverbial clause following a verb (: ke).  [[Old Glosa]]

{ I have also seen, as best I recall, 'ke' introducing a noun clause
{ in the Gaskell-Glosa dialect.  And again, I have never encountered
{ this use of the colon before.

        ii. A relative pronoun after a noun introduces an adjectival
             clauses (; qi).

      F. Adverbial clauses can start with a range of function words:-

         i. Logical comparatives e.g. anti-co.

        ii. Time words e.g. kron.

       iii. Location words e.g. topo.

        iv. Conjunctions e.g. te.

         v. Spatial relationship words e.g. dia.

      G. Interrogatives

         i. Simple question: "qe" followed by positive statement (Qe, -.)

        ii. `What' questions use "qod" (Qod es .. ).

       iii. Specific questions e.g. Qo-lo habe u .. .

      H. Negation

         i. Negating a verb place "ne" before it.

        ii. No thing or none of a substantive (nuli).

       iii. Negative statement (No!)

        iv. Opposition (anti)

{ Normally 'no-' forms opposites: 'ne-frigi' "not cold (but not
{ necessarily hot"; 'no-frigi' "hot".

         v. Neither .. nor (ni .. ni)

{ You might want to include "either .. or" for completeness.

        vi. An empty value (zero)

      I. Conjunctions combine equivalent elements of sentences

         i. Phrases e.g. e .

        ii. Clauses e.g. , sed .

{ What about subordinating conjunctions, if they are used at all?
{ They do not combine "equivalent" elements.  Note that I say "if they
{ are used at all."  There might be some rethinking about the whole
{ matter of using clauses in Glosa.  Pidgins could provide some insight
{ here.

      J. Prepositions introduce phrases

{ Some phrases are introduced by prepositions, but some are not.  This
{ statement might erroneously imply that prepositions introduce all
{ phrases.

         i. Noun phrases e.g. de u .. .

        ii. Verb phrases e.g. vice akti .. .

{ In such a case, the verb would probably be functionally equivalent
{ to a gerund or substantival infinitive, in which case we are still
{ talking about a substantive phrase.

      K. Generic terms affixed with a hyphen alter lexical categories

         i. Single term affixed e.g. ergo-ka  (=work room)

        ii. Two or more terms affixed e.g. vora-ru-lo (cutlery drawer)

_____>>>  4. Concept clusters
              For the expression of complex concepts, two or more
               concept/words with equivalent function can be grouped -
               analogous to the forming of complex characters in
               Chinese through the combining of radicals.

{ Combining radicals is an aspect of -written- Chinese, not necessarily
{ the spoken language.  I suggest finding a different analogy.

      L. Equivalent concept/words functioning as substantives

         i. Separated words follow a determinant, with modifiers in an
             accompanying clause e.g. un elektro magneto dina; akti a latu, ..

        ii. Forming a super concept using slashes (/) to join words.

{ How, pray tell, do you speak a slash?  More attention needs to be
{ given to the spoken language and NOT to rely too much on written forms
{ which cannot be spoken (unless you want to adopt Lojbanesque spoken
{ punctuation).

       iii. Three or more grouped words can be bracketted, showing they
             are part of one compex entity, using `pipes' (|.... ....|

{ No.  This is only getting worse.

      M. Words of mixed function forming a single concept

         i. Concept/words and function words hyphenated e.g. mero-de-voka

        ii. Generic terms combined with concept/words e.g. plu akusti-pe

_____>>>  5. Verbs used to convey the equivalent of TO BE
               Many different relationships are conveyed
                using different concept/words and function
                words where they would all be conveyed
                using a form of 'to be'in English.

{ An example of each usage would be helpful.

      N. Being as nature

         i. Is in essence, has the same nature ( es )

        ii. Is equal to, measures ( eqa )

       iii. Has the property of, impersonal quality ( habe )

      O. Becomes - being as process

         i. Is becoming ( gene )

_____>>>  6. Verb Types   [i.e. concept/words functioning as verbs]
               Verbs have different functions depending on whether they
                can stand alone with noun phrases before and after them,
                whether they might take clauses rather than noun phrases,
                or if they are always intransitive.  Also there are verbs
                that qualify other verbs, and those that usually take
                complements to form compund verbs.

      P. Primary verbs that usually take take noun phrases before and after

         i. Verbs of action or affect that sometimes take a clause
             instead of one noun phrase e.g. bate

        ii. Verbs of abstraction and feeling that often take clauses
             before and after them e.g. kogita

      Q. Auxiliary verbs are verbs that usually modify primary verbs

         i. Those that always modify a primary verb, preceding it, but
             following adverbial modifiers e.g. an posi kursi ci

        ii. Those which can stand alone as a verb, but which are
             intransitive when they do so e.g.  Fe pote.  Fe pote akti id.

       iii. Those which when standing alone can take a direct object
              e.g.  Fe hedo id.  Fe hedo fago u vora.

{ In which case they are no longer auxiliaries.

      R. Verboids are words that usually take a complementary word after
          them to create a compound verb

{ Again, the whole notion is "verboid" is amorphous and ill-defined.  I
{ do not find a whole lot of clarification here.  Is the very notion of
{ "verboid" even necessary just because Hogben used the term?  What is
{ the difference between a "verboid" and an auxiliary?  I suggest
{ dropping the term "verboid" altogether.

         i. Verboids that usually take a function word as their complement,
             and are intransitive when used alone   e.g.   An pa ki.
                An pa ki ad an domi.  Fe fu ki ana u monta.

{ If a verboid can be used alone as sole verb, then why is it a verboid
{ rather than a verb?

        ii. Verboids that take noun complements, and are transitive
             when used alone  e.g. An dice u verba.  An pa dice qestio fe.

{ Again.

       iii. Verboids that take a modifier as their complement,and are
             transitive when used alone  e.g.  Geo akti gira id axi.
                Fe pa akti id.

_____>>>  7. Particles
               These are the function words placed at the start of
                Noun Phrases.  [These can be ommitted when the meaning
                is clear from context, but their inclusion is at the
                discretion of the speaker.]

{ "Particle" is used more generally in grammatical discussions than
{ as just markers at the head of noun phrases.

      S. Singular coultables

{ Countables

         i. A, the ( u ) [ u(n) before vowel ]     e.g. u bibli

{ NO!!!  It is a VERY BAD MISTAKE for Clark&Ashby to have rendered
{ 'u(n)' (and 'plu') as "a" and "the."  It is logical nonsense for
{ the same word to represent both indefinite and definite articles.
{ Describe it however you will, but scrap "a/the" as grossly misleading.
{ Glosa does not have articles.

        ii. One, one of ( uno )  e.g. uno-pe

      T. Measurables

         i. Some, a little of ( u pusi de )  e.g. Bibe u pusi de lakti.

        ii. Some of, a piece of  ( u mero de ) e.g.. Habe u mero de pomo.

      U. Plural countables

         i. The (plural), more than one  ( plu )  e.g. plu bibli

{ See above.

        ii. A number of, several  ( plura )      e.g. plura andra

_____>>>  8. Tense of verbs
               Nine short function words, used singly or in
                combination produce all necessary tenses.
                [Absence of a tense particle implies the simple
                present tense.]    A tense table is included in
                the examples.

{ THIS IS A TERRIBLE HASH!!!  It confuses tense, aspect, mood, and
{ voice in a hopeless hodge-podge mistakenly called "tense."  A lot of
{ the difficulty may arise from confusion with that mess called the
{ English verb system.  The English system is -such- a mess that Glosa
{ should -deliberately- avoid trying to mimic it.  The whole description
{ needs to be reworked and not called "tense" willy-nilly.  (Sorry for
{ the strong language, but I honestly do think that both the verb system
{ and its description really do need attention.)

      V. Tense particles

         i. Past events ( pa )

        ii. Future events ( fu )

       iii. Perfect past events ( pra )   [[Old Glosa]]

{ Junk it.  It is a confusion of past tense and perfective aspect.
{ There is no reason in the world why Glosa verbs have to mimic
{ the messiness of the English verb system.  Keep it clean and
{ simple.

        iv. Continuing events ( du )

{ Imperfective aspect, not a tense.  Glosa also needs a perfective
{ aspect particle.  'No-du' might work, although I am not too thrilled
{ by it.  Some auxlangs use an adverb roughly meaning "already" as a
{ quasi-imperfective particle.  Glosa has 'pre-nu' for "already," but
{ to me that seems to convey a bit too much of present time rather than
{ aspect.  However, I am not in favor of inventing a particle if that
{ can be avoided.

         v. Presently-occurring event ( nu )

        vi. Conditional event, would occur .. if ( sio )

{ Mood, not tense.

       vii. Desired event, ought to, or should occur ( debi )

{ Mood, not tense.

      viii. Execution of an event: passive voice ( gene )

{ As I read the documentation, passive voice is rendered 'es ge-X'.
{ This has been discussed before but not, as I recall, resolved.
{ I am not in favor of the redundant 'gene ge-X' as a standard passive
{ form.  And leave "got" out of the picture!  It is not even standard
{ throughout the English-speaking world, apparently.  Do not import
{ yet another mess into Glosa.

        ix. Verb as adjective: participle ( ge- ) e.g. u ge-akuto seka-ru

{ Actually a passive participle.

         x. Verb as noun: gerund [No particle; syntax indicates function.]

{ Here is one instance in which I think 'u(n)/plu' IS suitable.  In
{ my example in 1.B.ii.b (? the outline format is very difficult to
{ follow), I deliberately used 'per U vide' as "by sight," forming a
{ gerund or substantival infinitive by use of the substantive marker
{ 'u' with a word otherwise used as a verb.  (Some languages, such
{ as Interlingua, do not have a gerund form as such.)

      W. Reflexive forms, action affects the subject of the sentence

{ Example?  'Auto' and 'se' have never been well distinguished for me.
{ In some languages, reflexivity is a matter of voice, not tense.  I
{ heartily recommend scrapping the term "tense table" and replacing it
{ with something more like "verb forms."

_____>>>  9. Punctuation
               This indicates the clausal and phrasal structure
                in the written form.  [In uninflected language,
                this is a significant part of the grammar.]

{ Again, the whole issue of punctuation needs to be revisited.

      X. Internationally used forms

{ What is "international" about these usages?.  Some of them seem rather
{ idiosyncratic to Glosa to me.

         i. Separating phrases, if necessary, separating clauses joined
             with a conjunction, and at the conclusion of clauses ( , )

{ Unless, of course, a clause is at the end of a sentence.

        ii. Introducing adjectival clauses, placed before `qi' ( ; )

       iii. Introducing adverbial clauses, placed before `ke' ( : )

        iv. Listing clauses after a major clause ( Xx: xxxx; xxxx; xxxx. )

         v. Questions are terminated with a question mark ( ? )

        vi. Emphatic statements are terminated with an exclamation mark (!)

       vii. Direct speech is surrounded with quotation marks ( "Xxxxxx." )

      viii. Literary references marked with single quotes ( `xx xxx xx' )

        ix. Titles of books and documents marked with underlines ( _xxx_ )

{ Usually with italics in printed works.

         x. Statements in parenthesis either marked with commas or
             brackets ( , xxx,  OR  (xxx) )

{ Parenthetical statement are enclosed in parentheses; appositives
{ are set off by commas in English usage.

        xi. At the completion of a sentence (major clause) or to show
             an abbreviation that finishes on a letter other than the
             terminal one, a point is used ( .  OR  X. )

      Y. Further marking off of phrases, additional information,
          or asides in syntax-based grammar - to assist in the
          understanding of structure

         i. Additional information within a clause is separated off using
             dashes ( xxx - xxx xxxx - xx )

        ii. Additional information at the end of a sentence separated
             using a single dash ( xxx - xxxx xxx. )

{ For these two, some typographical conventions use a double hyphen or,
{ in printed matter, the em dash.

       iii. For emphasis, or to add contrasting information, within a
             sentence, three points are used for separation ( xxx ...
             xx xx ... xxxx )

{ Not good.  Three points usually indicate an ellipsis.

        iv. An alternative means of separating information, that is not
             part of the normal syntactic sentence, is the use of double
             points ( xx xxx .. xx xxx .. xxxx )

      Z. Non-literal language is marked using either one or two
          carats (^), which indicate the word used stylistically, or
          phrase that has been imported from a national language
          [This is especially relevant when the syntax-based
          language is being used as a `pivot' language for
          translation between national languages.]

{ Special written marking of figurative language seems to be a
{ Robingaskellism I have never encountered anywhere else.  Besides,
{ how do you speak a caret?  (A carat is a jeweler's unit weight of
{ 200 milligrams. :-) )  Skip any special marking.

         i. For simple word replacement, such as metaphor, a single
             carat is placed after the word used non-literally
             ( xxx xxxx^ xxxx )

{ Great care should be exercised when using metaphor and simile at all.

        ii. For idiom, carats before and after the usage - that is
             brought in from a national language - separate it, and mark
             it for special treatment ( xx xxx ^xxxx xx xxx^ xxx )

{ ABSOLUTELY NOT!!!  IDIOMS SHOULD BE AVOIDED ALTOGETHER, in which case
{ there is absolutely no need to mark them with punctuation.  I am not
{ the first to remark that idioms should be avoided in an auxlang like
{ the plague.
