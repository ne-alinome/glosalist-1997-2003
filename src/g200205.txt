A "male life" could be "an-vive" (like "fe-bovi" ...).
I am still not convinced and would agree with Syd:
With the order

  <noun phrase marker u(n)/plu> +
  <attributes, also possessive pronouns> +
  ...
  <main concept word, noun>

the noun phrase could be easier acknowledged.

Another argument: appositions.

Wrong (but IMO better) Glosa:
  "Mi ne amo plu vi simi."  - I do not like your apes.
Classical Glosa:
  "Mi ne amo vi plu simi."  - I do not like your apes.
Apposition:
  "Mi ne amo vi, plu simi." - I do not like you apes.

No. In Glosa ~andro~ means "man", and ~an~ means "he"
and includes animal maleness. So "a/the man's life"
would be ~u andro vive~.

Compare ~vi tri simi~ [your three apes] and
~tri vi simi~ [the ape belonging to you three people].

According to GID:
an 1++G          he; him; his; male; masculine
andro 1++G       gentleman; husband; man

So you're saying that ~an~ means male (adj) but not male (n)?  How would I know 
this? Are you saying that ~andro~ cannot mean male (adj), masculine (adj)?

"man" = "male human" or ~un andro~ = ~un an homi~

But there are male animals, which are also "males".

So "male" does not equal "man". 

My Granny's budgie is a male, but not a man!

I would think without a clue from context that     
~un andro equs~ was a half-man-half-horse creature 
out of mythology, or possibly, "the man's horse".

Yes, it's an interesting preposition. I believe
Russian has one like it, to mark the thing owned.

Is is possible in Glo to invert the sentence
~U bibli es de mi~ [The book belongs to me] and
get ~Mi es sa u bibli~ [I am the owner of the book]?

SA (~sa~) is a Glo (not Glosa) word. In Glo (not Glosa):

~u parenta zoa~ = a parent animal (animal that is a parent)
~u parenta sa zoa~ = a parent's animal

The first sentence is ambiguous in Glosa.

18 Steps and the Glosa Basic Reference list ~Sinior~ for mister (abbreviated 
~Sr.~), and they list ~Siniora~ and ~Siniorina~ for miss/mrs/ms, all abbreviated 
as ~Sa.~ The GID shifts these to ~senior~ and ~seniora~

Of course, distinguishing the marital status and perhaps youthfulness of women 
but not men is a pointless, sexist cultural artifact, and should not be carried 
into Glosa.

There is a suggestion in 18 steps (presumably added by Marcel?) that proposes 
~Civi~, ~An-civi~, and ~Fe-civi~ as better honorific terms.

Glo (not Glosa) currently has ~an~ for mr. and ~fe~ for miss/ms/mrs. For 
example: ~mi pa dona plu sito ad fe Brown.~ I'm not sure if Glo will keep these 
or shift to something else. As a member of a "younger generation" and a resident 
of a very casual culture, I'm not big on honorifics.

As for "steep", I assume you mean "sharply inclined", and not "allowing tea to 
strengthen". The GID has ~fo-klina~ as a core word for steep.

Here's the (current) entry point for Glo:

http://qualitycode.com/html/glo-intro.eng.html

It's still very much a moving target. I would guess that the vocabulary is 90% 
locked down, and the rules are probably 80% solid. But it's still young enough 
that anything can change. For example, I recently removed ~uno~ (because it is 
redundant with ~u~), and renamed ~ze~ back to ~zero~ (to be more like Glosa and 
to have as few one-syllable non-particles as possible).

Chris Byrd is well known to former AUXLANG subscribers.
Anyone can check those archives for his famous exploit,
where he accidentally emailed to that list the details
of his plot to lie and suppress embarassing information
about his favorite IAL. A back-stabbing contest would

While playing around with the BNF model for Glo, I realized that adverbs in 
Glosa seem to be all over the place. I would like to restrict them to a single 
location in Glo. My definition of "adverb" here is: any word or phrase that 
modifies the verb.

Here's what I see in Glosa right now:

~mi pa tako gresi.~
~mi pa mite u nota ad tu.~ (~ad tu~ is the adverb)
~pre nu, mi pa gresi.~ (~pre nu~ is the adverb)
~qo mode, mi pa gresi?~ (~qo mode~ is like an adverb)

It seems that every possible structure of English has been allowed into Glosa, 
which makes things much more complex than they need to be.

Following the rule that modifiers precede head words, we would have something 
like:

~mi pa tako gresi.~
~mi pa, ad tu, gresi.~
~mi pa pre-nu gresi.~
~mi pa qo mode gresi?~

Perhaps it's reasonable to say that if the "adverb" begins with a preposition, 
it can follow the verb, since we already have that rule for nouns. But does it 
go before or after the object?

~mi pa mite u nota ad tu~
~mi pa mite ad tu u nota~

The first is more comfortable for me, but I'm not sure it is any more logical or 
clear. Why not: ~mi pa ad tu mite u nota~, or even ~ad tu, mi pa mite u nota.~

I'm sure some of you feel that this flexibility is crucial to the success of 
Glosa, because without it authors will feel too constrained. Even if that were 
true (and I disagree), I believe that there should be just one "recommended" or 
"standard" form.

I'm going to go off and read Rick Morneau's pages, but I thought I would toss 
this question out to the list to see what people think.

There are at least 4 types of "adverbs" as far as I know:
you left out sentence modifiers (like "hopefully, ...")
and adjective modifiers (like "VERY wet"). Your definition
would include adverbial phrases (like "in a pig's eye")
and regular verb modifiers (like "he NEVER saw it").

> It seems that every possible structure of English has been allowed into Glosa,

English has complex syntax, completely unsuitable for an IAL.

Any phrase can be topicalized by placing it first in the sentence.
The direct object usually has the closest tie to the verb and so
should immediately follow it; I think it should take a special
preposition (perhaps "em"?) whenever it strays from normal position,
just as the agentive subject does (using "per" or "ex" or "ab").

> I'm sure some of you feel that this flexibility is crucial

Flexibility competes with simplicity. All languages are compromises ...
except Lisp.

in a SVO sentence, an adjective should be close to the N it modifies or there 
would be confusion. An adverb can be more or less anywhere as there is only 
one V in the clause. I rather like the idea that, as V, S and O have intro 
particles, so could adjective and adverb phrases, further I should like to be 
able to use particles that define S and O(like "em")
Prepositions to some extent can do that .......

Saluta!
I had too many porblems and events in my life, so I approx. didn't use
internet and was not active in Glosa. Adverbs is my favourite theme, so it's
good for begin.
I have to make a trip from Moscow for 2 or 3 days, and after that, I hope,
I'll send all the letter that wait to be posted to Charles, Marcel and
others!

This seems to mean
I was walking in the manner of yesterday.
There there is an "adverb2", wich definition maybe "the word or group of
words that modiefs the whole phrase".
I suppose: pre-nu, mi pa gresi.
If you will have combined both verbal adverbs, this will be great for Glosa,
not only for Glo.

Perhaps, is would be better to dispite the "indirect object" from the
adverb. But it's interesting how similliar they are in this case! However,
for Glosa it will be better to save the Hogben's view on the IO.
And of course I agree that we MUST systemize the using of adverb.

Verbal adverb modifies the verb or the verbal phrase. It precedes the thing
it modiefs.
If it's necessary, it's despited by commas, or connects with verb by the
hyphen.

Alex.

Syd said:

So a noun phrase gets a pseudo-BNF description something like:
"NP = preposition + determininers + adjectives + noun + NPs"
.. i.e., NPs are recursive. In some languages the noun's
modifiers can be scattered all across the sentence randomly,
but Glosa is extremely order-dependent.

> An adverb can be more or less anywhere as there is only
> one V in the clause.

Not precisely so, because it can be unclear what it attaches to.
Even a proper "adverbial" phrase that wanders can be ambiguous:
"He chased the dog WITH a broomstick IN his underwhere."

> I rather like the idea that, as V, S and O have intro
> particles, so could adjective and adverb phrases

Me too. But the positions of those phrases should be constrained.
English is unusual in its high degree of syntactic ambiguity,
and this should not be imported to Glosa.

> further I should like to be
> able to use particles that define S and O

I agree. Whenever sentence phrase order is unusual, use of
prepositions removes the unclarity. We already have "per"
and "ex", only the direct object lacks one. (I think "de"
might be used immediately following the verb, but that's
not what we need here.) Otto Jesperson proposed "em",
and in Ido they use "na", IIRC.

    Yes, in English the text book location for adverbs is AFTER the verb.
 EG  He ran quickly to work.
    But, quite pragmatically, if the Verb Phrase is going to become
awkwardly overloaded through the addition of excessive adverbs, then some
of the adverbs get shunted to the front, or the tail, of the sentence as
much-elided Adverbial Clauses.
         EG  While still eating breakfast, he ran quickly to work, heavily
overloaded.
         If RAN is the action,
                QUICKLY,
                WHILE STILL EATING BREAKFAST, and
                HEAVILY OVERLOADED
all modify this action.

   Can Glosa also spread its 'adverbial' modifiers around in a similar
fashion?  I cannot see why not!
   If we rigidify Glosa's structure (or try to), thus making it 'inhuman',
we might get something equvalent to,
  EG  He ran quickly, while still eating breakfast and heavily overloaded,
to work.

  In Glosa, modifiers precede the word they modify ('adjectives' before
'nouns'; and 'adverbs' before 'verbs'): note, there being no Part-of-Speech
markers in Glosa, ~celero~ is used to translate both "fast" and "quickly." 

  IE  An pa kurso celero, tem du fago an prima vora, e fero excesi masi, ad
an ergo-lo.   [Adverb content AFTER the verb as in English]

Or putting modifiers, where they should be in Glosa, BEFORE the 'verb',
      An celero, tem du fago an prima vora, e fero excesi masi, pa kurso ad
an ergo-lo.  

  But it might be kinder to the listener to break up the Adverbial element
to give him, or her, psychological time to absorb the various modifications
to the action.

  IE  Du fago an prima vora, e du fero excesi masi, an pa celero kurso, ad
an ergo-lo.

   I would hate to say that the BNF model, being only artificially
intelligent, could possibly suffer from an excessive need for
standardisation.  And it might be Politically Incorrect to suggest that
good Glosa, being planned to make sense, ultimately, to human beings,
possibly will not fit a rigidified structure.  However, I do venture such
thoughts.

              A = to, towards (AD is used before words whose intial letter
is a vowel).
              From the above non-contextual sentence, I have surmised the
one person attempted to send the contents of a book over the Internet to
another, FOR practice at transmission through the Net. 
              In Glosa (and in English) the above examples would have
meaning differences - on as far as the emphasis: the most important, and
most emphasised, phrase come first; the least emphasised, and possibly most
assumed, phrase comes last.

  I would rearrange the sentence - according to my preferred emphasis - thus:-

 ~ 5)  Pro praxi, mi pa mite u bibli a tu.

But practical too. A few years ago I wrote a web CGI translation
assistant for Glosa-to-English. Instead of attempting the impossible,
it simply takes a paragraph of Glosa text and generates a *glossary*.
The output side can be adapted very easily to any other language.
And the input side works with Ido and similar IALs.

I think you are attempting to reinvent the sentence parse tree,
or maybe a part-of-speech tagger, or both. These are inherently
difficult and complicated though interesting as tools of analysis.
If a program could input one natural language and output another,
it would be done already, and there'd be no need for an IAL.

one which starts 'relative clauses'; but the other one is harder to pin
down.  In English, I notice that I seem to use it more than most.  That I
seem to use it more than most, is noticable, in my use of English.
    This second use appears to be associated with the verb, rather than
with a noun.  And the "that" is used somewhat as a mathematical
"therefore."  When I use Glosa, I wish to be similarly specific; thus, I
have not yet been convinced that the Old Glosa ~ke~ is useless, and must go.

a mark of punctuation with a 'pausal factor' somewhere between that of the

it is necessary to do so necessary, most of us would use the          comma
to separate phrases.  Because clauses have greater significance, the
authors chose to mark them with a divider of greater power than that of the
simple comma.  So, I will not mention the semicolon again, I shall simply
continue to use it the way the Glosa authors thought appropriate.

  "An pa dice de an anas es pato."*

An pa dice de an anas; qi habe pato. OR An pa dice de an anas; habe pato.

in its achievment, from different directions.  The ''whatever'' example is
confusing: with usage, things go from whiteness to blackness, not the other
way around.  The functional location in which you placed the "qod", is that
of a Relative Pronoun - defined in Glosa as ~qi~.  So, the ~ke~, which
relates to verbs, not nouns, would not have been used in this situation.

    When Rick Morneau and I were both on Conlang, we did exchange ideas on
syntax, sometimes differing on points of usage: I will happily read his

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary
From: Charles{at}xxxxx{dot}Com
Date: Sat, 18 May 2002 13:24:20 -0700

I've further refined the word selection "technology" ...
and thought of some objective measures to apply to results.

For instance, the combined official Glosa dictionaries
contain approximately 8468 unique G-words that yield
7906 unique English equivalents. However, this requires
12681 entries in total, which indicates the overlap
of the much-decried excess of synonyms in the GED.
Any manual word selection process tends to produce
this effect, but by algorithm I am getting more like
6318, 5743, 6318; in other words, much less overlap,
implying better coverage of semantic space.

Also, it appears that automatic handling of the
"false friends" problem is possible by use of a
clever/dirty heuristic trick. Inevitably there
will be troublesome entries like this:

farin  FLOUR    fre farine, ita farina, por farinha
farin  floury   ita farinaceo
farin  meal     fre farine, por farinha
farin  PHARYNX  eng pharynx, ita faringe, spa faringe

The current algorithm resolves this by selecting the
"farin = flour" possibility and forgetting "pharynx".
It also makes for a neater reverse-sorted listing,
and remaining synonyms are glaringly apparent:

Result    ENGLISH      Multilingual sources
--------  ===========  --------------------
fable     fable        eng fable, fre fable
fabul     fable        por fábula, spa fábula
fabric    fabricate    eng fabricate, fre fabriquer, ita fabbricare, por fabrique, spa fabricar
face      face         eng face, fre face
cara      face         por cara, spa cara
facet     facet        eng facet, fre facette, spa faceta
facial    facial       eng facial, spa facial
facil     facile       eng facile, fre facile, ita facile, por fácil, spa fácil
facsim    facsimile    eng facsimile, spa facsímil

I think using a better Italian dictionary could resolve
many of the ties, like cara/face and fable/fabul ...
but this is only intended as a proof-of-concept anyway.

>
*  Yes Folks,
   I had a look at Rick's essay, and BNF is a computer technology way of
spelling out the syntax used in a computer programming language.
   Now, Rick is a great guy, but he writes in a rather dry style.  So,
should you check out this essay, be prepared to do quite a lot of hard
thinking ... some of it 'between the lines.'

   Although I am only half-way through it so far, I would venture a
progress report:-
  . Sorry, there is no ready explanation of what BNF stands for.   
  . The BNF system successively analyses sentence structure into its
smaller parts, so that the syntactic definition of a sentence might take
five, or more, lines (layers of ever-deeper analysis) to tease it out.
  . Rick does give examples, but leaves the reader to link the parts of the
example with the actual theory, as stated in the essay.
  . From the limited existing evidence of changes in the gross syntax of
languages, Rick says the conclusion is that languages fluctuate between SOV
and VSO order, with neither being the ultimate form; and he states very
clearly that the SVO expression of a language is considered to be a
transitional stage between these two 'polar' forms.  English and Glosa, it
seems, are both in 'transitional' mode. 
  . Quite clearly, he gives the word, "that" two distinct syntactic
function when it is operating in ''relative'' mode: in the normal one,
"that" is a 'relative pronoun' starting an Adjectival Clause modifying the
Noun, which it follows - usually immediately; and the less described "that"
he calls a Conjunction ('and', 'but', 'or' class) and shows that it
modifies the Verb, starting a Noun Clause when at the beginning of the
sentence, or an Adverbial Clause if it comes after the Verb it modifies.

   So, relating this to the subject of this List, Rick defines the two
syntactic function that the English "that" translates into, when the
''relative'' concept is used in Glosa:
    A. "The cow, that is in the milking shed, needs to be let out."
   In this example we have the normal ~qi~ usage with its controversial,
preceding ";" to indicate the start of an Adjectival Clause.
       ~U vaka; qi habe loka intra u mulge-do, nece gene lase ab.~

    B. "He ran so quickly that he arrived first."
       "She said, that we must walk slowly."
       "That it is going to rain, is quite clear from looking at the sky." 
   In these sentences, the "that," which Rick describes as a Conjunction,
relates directly to the action, and starts an Adverbial Clause or a Noun
Clause.  I suggest, that in his essay, Rick has clearly pin-pointed a valid
syntactic difference in the uses of "that" when it starts subordinate
clauses in English; and, I consider that such a difference also exists in
Glosa when employing the ''relative'' concept, and that the two forms ~qi~
and ~ke~(O.G.)
amply, and beneficially, embody this difference.
       ~An pa kursi ta celero, ke an veni prima.~   ------- a.
       ~Fe pa dice: ke na debi lento gresi.~    ----------- b.
   OR  ~Fe pa dice: na debi lento gresi.~    -------------- b'.    
       ~Ke il fu pluvi, habe fo evide ex u ciela.~   ------ c.
   OR  ~Ke il fu pluvi, na klari vide ex skope u ciela.~ -- c'. 

... to be continued, after I read the second half of Rick's gripping work.  

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S.  It's an interesting essay: I suggest that all read it.  R.

True. Here's one BNF "tutorial" that answers your question...and many questions 
you weren't asking. Stop as soon as you get bored, because your answer is right 
up front. It's just the first google hit, so I don't pretend it's the best

I completely agree with you that the ~qi~ and ~ke~ concepts exactly match to the 
two forms of "that". 

Personally, I prefer a comma before ~qi~ and a semi-colon before ~ke~. For ~ke~, 
it's because I can (hopefully) please both the semi-colon fans and the ~ke~ 
fans, with no ambiguity. For ~qi~, I guess it doesn't feel like it needs such a 
big pause, but I could be persuaded otherwise.

*  Thanks for the support, Kevin,
   I was totally blown away by this part of Rick's essay, and will send an
extract from the essay to Wendy .. requesting that she reconsider her
earlier statement on the undesirability of ~ke~.
   Also, it really doesn't matter whether we use a colon, semi-colon, comma
or nothing ... when introducing supplementary clauses.  When the reader is
engrossed in the exploits of Cinerala, he/she is not going to stop reading
or become confused by the absence or over-use of punctuation, which is only
supposed to be an aid to humanisation of the text, simulating the
writer/speaker's pauses and intonation.
   Rather than worry about it, I would suggest that Glosa writers do, in
fact, use the punctuation of their choice, when writing stories, and
calling on this ''relative'' function.  This is similar to the suggestion
Ron Clark made, in relation to the 'terminal vowel': allowing it to
"float."  Needless to say, that "floating" of the vowel did cause a lot of
havoc, and gained little benefit; however, allowing the punctuation before
~qi~ and ~ke~ to 'float' should do far less damage, and might do some good.

   What really will do harm is if Glosa-pe do NOT write stories in Glosa -
whichever punctuation they might plan to use!!!

Saluta,

Robin

Well, I said earlier that "parse trees" might be more
to your liking. But *any* analysis will be tedious.
All sentences of normal complexity, 10 to 20 words,
require a systematic method for proper analysis.

Your plea contains 2 subclauses, a fancy genitive,
a free compound, and coordination sans conjunction,
5 nouns 4 verbs 3 adjs 3 determs 2 preps 2 pronouns
(but no adverbs of any variety, a great relief).

The simple teenage souls are presently out evolving
some sort of hyper-encoded acronymic chat language
tailored to their text-messaging toys.

    Though Sid might not be listening, I would like to amplify his comment
by adding that the two words are "proscribed" and "natural."
    I feel that the Morneau pattern would see the 'ideal' auxilliary
language as following a reasonably well-defined formula, while Sid and I
would be more in the inspirational, intuitional camp.
    What the BNP analysis does, is suggest that there ought to be a
proscribed set of rules bounding the newly forming language so that it is
quite regularised; and, Rick does support this with the idea of the
"machine handling" of language.  However, I think that, in the ultimate
situation, language can only be meaningful inside the minds of humans, so I
opt for the more "naturalised" form of the 'ideal' AL.

There are languages that use only one particle for sub-clauses.
Europeans use "que" "quel" and "qui", Glosa lacks the "que":

QUE/THAT ..... "I know KE the world is flat."
QUI/WHO ...... "Columbus is the guy QI is wrong."
QUEL/WHICH ... "Round is the shape QOD is impossible."

I'd rather eject QI and QOD and keep KE, because easier:
"the guy KE is wrong", "the shape KE is impossible".
We can do that in English (THAT=KE) in most cases too,
though there are too many THATs altogether ... and often,
a THAT can be elided as in "I know the world is flat".

> This is similar to the suggestion

I think he was right to let it float.

*   Drat,
    I did a beautiful reply, but must have been so sleepy I hit the wrong
button, and lost it.
  . How does the machine think?
  . Can a hand sort of GID produce a 7000 odd list?
  . I would keep the "1++" entries and a few rare (G) & (L) synonyms.
  . Two years ago I used a word processing macro to 'reverse' the GLOSA
6000 list from Glosa-->Eng to Eng-->Glosa; I could do the opposite, and
take the GID Eng->Glosa and 'reverse' it to Glosa->Eng.
  . I might call the streamlined GID list GID(s) or GID.S; the final
result, with English-language synonyms collapsed into single items per
Glosa word, ought to come down to around 7000 odd words.
  . This is a job for a rainy weekend, or maybe for my holiday, which comes
in September.
  . Meanwhile, before that is attempted, I would need to co-ordinate with
Marcel to get the synonyms finalised, so they slotted into the GID neatly.
  . What takes the time is agonising over whether, or not, a word should be
included in a dictionary; this would be the case with making up a Starter
Glosa Dictionary of 2500 words, but should not be a consideration, in this
case, where the GID is being simplified, not pruned.

   Sorry Charles, I am not yet convinced that the concept is proven.
However, I must admit that such a mechanical simplification, which I think
you are talking about - overcoming the problem of excessive dictionary
entries - could be achieved a lot quicker by machine processing than by the
hand/eye method I describe.  Can you convince me that the quality of the
job would be as good as that of one involving a suitably primed human mind?

Saluta,

Arbitrariness of the person hand-sorting is precisely
what led to the inadequacy of Glosa's lexicon.

I let the algorithm do that. Only a team of professional linguists
would be qualified to do what you are proposing -- the first time
this was tried, the result was Ido; the second time, Gode's Interlingua.
I don't consider either to be sufficient, practical, modern, or esthetic.

I'm just a techie, not a salesman. I do know that the dictionaries
produced for Novial and Occidental are in 95% agreement and beat
Glosa by a wide margin, and I can reproduce their word selections
by algorithm from impartial up-to-date bilingual public-domain sources.

Subject: [glosalist] dictionary of IAL roots
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Mon, 27 May 2002 20:04:08 -0700

I've been experimenting with word-selection algorithms,
now importing the Glosa and Ido vocabularies. They can
mix well with the Romance languages, unsurprisingly.
Glosa closely resembles Italian, as was suspected.
Anyway, here is an illustrative example, taking all
resulting NOV- items from the raw data, and assuming
the format to be obvious enough ...

nov    new        4  fre nouveau, ido nov, ita nuovo, por novo
nov    nine       2  ita nove, por nove
nov    nova       2  eng nova, spa nova
nov    novel      3  fre nouveau, ita nuovo, por novo
nov    tidings    2  glo nova, ita nuova
novam  again      2  ita nuovamente, por novamente
novel  novel      4  eng novel, glo noveli, por novela, spa novela
novel  novelette  2  eng novelette, ido novel
novel  novelist   2  eng novelist, spa novelista
novel  novelly    2  eng novelly, fre nouvel
novem  november   3  eng november, glo novembro, ido novembr
noven  ninety     2  por noventa, spa noventa
noven  novena     2  eng novena, spa novena
novic  novice     3  eng novice, fre novice, ido novic

First, there seem to be 7 distinct and useful meanings
among the lot, most of them overloading "nov" to the extent
that it cannot rationally serve as a root unaided. The trick
of using terminal vowels to differentiate them is inadequate.
This also happens with most other simple 3- or 4-letter roots.
I conclude that longer CVCVC roots are needed for the base
international vocabulary G's authors call "Mega-Glosa".

Second, there has been a great shift and development from
Greco-Latin to the modern languages; NOVEL today brings
to mind a lurid daytime tv series for housewives, a NOVA
is an exploding star, NOVEM is the 11th month (not 9th).
It would be worse to deny the modern meanings, confusing
99% of the potential audience for an IAL, than to select
totally new and arbitrary meanings, as did Loglan/Lojban.

Third, there is no way to prevent overlap of meanings.
NOVEL will usually mean "a long story", more or less,
but it will also mean "new and unusual", unless people
stretch NOVIC to mean both "someone new to something"
and "a thing that is new to the observer".

So, accepting the algorithm's choice of roots and merging
meanings for NOVEN and NOVIC and NOVEL, and allowing those
troublesome terminal vowels to just float away ...

novam = again
novel = novel, new
novem = november
noven = novena, nine
novic = novice, new

Of course I cheated on "nine", a notorious case.
Maybe adding a few more vocabs would resolve that.
I'm certainly non-accepting of NON = "nine" ...

glo  enea   nine
glo  nona   nine
ido  non    nine
fre  neuf   nine
ita  nove   nine
por  nove   nine
spa  nueve  nine

This is effectively what the Glosa authors are 
saying, except they chose ~qi~.

~qi~ = that (relative), who, which
 (as in "the guy; QI is wrong", 
    "the shape; QI is impossible")

that (conjunction)  always elided


and ~qod~ = what = that which
   (as in I know what you are thinking)

Yes. This is a good solution, provided 
the one word = one concept monoseme 
principle is going to be abandoned.

It looks to me (but it's difficult to ascertain) they meant
QI to be animate and QOD inanimate, or else QI as nominative
and QOD objective. I think just one particle could cover all.
The authors clearly put the semicolon in the wrong position,
at the beginning of the sub-clause; which is already marked by
the relative particle. Sic! I suppose they want to distinguish
attributive from restrictive clauses, but why bother?

About the floating gender vowels ... English speakers don't
realize we have the same 2 grammatical genders as the French,
a feminine in -e and a masculine in -(null), e.g. bat/bate,
hat/hate, mat/mate, ad inf.

there is some semantic functionality in the alphabet: I have been working
on this assumption, for ages.

*   Amazingly, I'd have picked Charles as one who would call for greater,
rather than less, discrimination in language.  However, I wish to add
that, as in English, these different 'clause markers' might introduce
different sorts of clauses, similarly - but not identically - I believe
them to have such a function in Glosa.

    My reading of the Glosa literature, both explanatary (in English),
and the corpus (in Glosa), leads me to shed the word-for-word translaion
idea for these particles: there is <bold>not</bold>, as Charles suggests
a

   QUE/THAT / KE 

   QUI/WHO / QI

   QUEL/WHICH / QOD

                         relationship.


   In English, many have trouble with the THAT and WHICH introducing
Adjectival Clauses, modifying Nouns.  There is little to discriminate
between them: it is tedious, but I will answer questions if
non-native-speakers-of-English ask; in this situation they have identical
syntactic function.

   Meanwhile, THAT in English, can be an Identifier, an Adjectival Clause
marker, and an Adverbial Clause marker: these usages all have different
syntactic funtions:-

    He wore THAT hat.        ................................Id.

    He wore the hat THAT is now hanging on the third peg. ...Adj.

    He wore the hat THAT way.      ..........................Adv.

    He wore it THAT all would know he was king.   ...........Adv.

    They all knew THAT he was king, because of the crown (THAT) he 
wore.

              ^   Adv.                               ^    Adj.

              |_ [..............]                    |__ [............]


   And WHO(M), THAT and WHICH, different though they might look, can all
have the same syntactic function ... of introducing an Adjectival Clause,
with of course, the WHO or WHOM introducing a clause that modifies a
personal Proper Noun, collective noun describing people, or a personal
pronoun.  This could all be shown to be so, using examples; however, to
return to Glosa, it seems that the one word, QI, introduces 

<bold>all </bold>Adjectival Clauses.

    An habe tri feli; qi fago mega qantita de sito.    [... WHICH ...]

    An es un andra; qi habe tri mega feli.             [... WHO ...]

    An habe u manu; qi pa don u fatali impakti.        [... THAT ...]

    An; qi holo vi ski, fu tosto ki ex ci.             [... WHOM ...]


  As I have said before, English is a "bastard language" having had not
one, but many, illegitemate fatherings.  Glosa, on the other hand, the
sole issue of Ron and Wendy, had the chance of getting a well-defined
pedigree.  Breeding such a 'pedigreed' language, the authors sought to
eliminate most of the ^mongrel^ elements of English and those of most
Euro-languages - to produce a language, in which the Synax was pure.


  So, we come to a divide: prior to Glosa, words were concrete things
whose meanings were solid object connected to the categories of things
they symbolised; crossing the 'Bridge of Abstraction,' Glosa moved into
the land, where words symbolised concepts; and the ordering of these
symbols determined which function the concept would manifest ...
<italic>thing, action </italic>or <italic>description. 

  </italic>Back from the somewhat Celtic, fairy-tale story, above,
becoming more grounded and materialistic, I would say that we need to see
the syntactic function, within Glosa, as of paramount importance.<italic>
 </italic>Still, being human, and hearing words in our heads .. as well
as 'feeling' ideas .. the Glosa syntactic abstractions need to be able to
be grounded in the more concrete national languages, that we have used as
thinking tools, heretofore.


  QI  =   Adjectival Clause flag [that ; which; who; whom]

  KE  =   Ad    ial Clause flag  (of reason) [that; so]

  TE  =      "         "     "   (of intention) [in order to]

  LO  =      "         "     "   (of place) [where]  

  TEM =      "         "     "   (of time) [when]  

  KA  =      "         "     "   (of cause) [because]


   These are the Glosa particle that deal with most daily events, and I
would stress, again, that they are not related on a word-to-word basis
with National language words, but <bold>are </bold>related directly to
the syntactic/semantic function of the concepts conveyed.  In terms of
"Language Universals," the various Adverbial Clausic Markers will all
occur in the same position(s) in relation to the position of the verb, IE
they are positionally inter-replaceable .. because they all have the same
syntactic function.


>> This is similar to the suggestion

>> Ron Clark made, in relation to the 'terminal vowel': allowing it to
"float."

>

>I think he was right to let it float.

>

*   Can't recall my actual quote here, but, yes, and no: the floating of
the final vowel was a research ploy, not a final word on the language.

    Ron hoped that some pattern of "natural" use would emerge if he
encouraged "Glossa" users to allow intuition to aid them in the choice of
final vowels for the concept-words they used - noting that they were not
(necessarily) specific for different Parts of Speech.  The result of the
experiment could have had permanently 'floating' final vowels; some
vowels preferred for certain Parts of Speech; or a final decision, on the
final setting of terminal vowels for each word, determined on a
word-by-word basis.  Well, there has been a strong majority of
Glosalist-pe in favour of setting the final vowel for each word, such
that children might be taught the <bold>correct</bold> spelling for each
word .. with an unchanging final vowel.

    The GID is a step along the way for settling these finals.  With a
little more tweaking, the GID can be pushed to being a GD, such that for
most English words there was one Glosa word; with, for a small number of
words, a second Glosa word, representing the single synonym.

*   I have tried 'parse trees' and as helpful as they might have seemed,
originally, I now tend to think that they could have been one of Chomsky's
mistakes.  They are so awkward and space-consuming, that the Chomsky brain
should have come up with 'parse bushes' or 'parse herbs' as a simplification.
    So, I will mention here that throughout history, some thinkers have
tried to symbolise the syntactic elements of sentences.  And, naturally
enough, simply because Glosa is a language with "Syntax-based Grammar," I
decided to have another look at the possibility of doing so.  (GAS is
attached)

 At noon, he ran across the road, which was very busy.

 _@ .  ' \!  @ .   (\! %>)_                 .............(GAS)

Tem midi, an pa kurso tran u via; qi pa habe fo aktivi.

 _@ .  ' \!  @ .   (\! %.)_                 .............(GAS)

  Note there is little between the syntactic codings for the English and
Glosa versions.
  While it does no harm to ^blow ones own trumpet^, so far, it has done no
good, either.  One day, I will publish the GAS system as a monograph;
anyone, who, after reading the attachment, is interested in helping refine
this syntactic analysis, and in adding their name to the author line,
should contact me.

*  I suspect that the sort of analysis - resulting in a list of categories
- done by Charles is not very helpful.  By contrast, the GAS is economical
on space, and does maintain the locations of the words, phrases and clauses
symbolised .. using space(s) as part of the analysis.  Also, the GAS
provides both visual and literal dimensions to the analysis.

Romance langs botched it horribly by confusing the question words
with relatives (QUE QUI QUEL), but English did better distinguishing
its WH from TH words (WHAT vs. THAT). It is a well-known mistake in
IAL design to follow that Romantic error. Of course Rick Morneau has
addressed the use of TH deictic words, as we've discussed before.
The so-called "correlatives" of Esperanto are a good example.

You underestimate my laziness. An easier IAL is a better one.

Well, that would solve that. Let's jettison the useless and ugly QOD.
Still, KE would be nicer than QI, which looks more Chinese than Greek.
And why not fuhnetisaiz Q to KU, anyway?

DNA testing reveals that QOD (and much besides) was Hogben's.

An IAL is for adults, not children. And adults in the real world will
never memorize arbitrary terminal vowels.

That would be horrible, but if you want to relex English it has been done
very systematically already in "Classical Yiklamu", somewhere on the web.
It comes with a nice grammar and appears to be complete, usable, and cute.

A lot has been learned about typography and easy legibility.
It's necessary to emphasize breaks between long sentences,
and the substructures within them.

So the first thing I'd do (besides breaking the long block into
smaller paragraphs) would be to either: 1) use the international
convention of starting all sentences with a capitalized word,
and this would be especially easy in Glosa because a capitalized
particle (like U) would not be mistaken for a proper noun;
and/or, 2) leave extra space between sentences, or even invent
a new bizarre bit of punctuation like "double-period" for what
most Europeans call the "full stop". Before and after:

Intra u mo kam eko mero ko u frigi plus no-juve aero, qi nu es
no-facili de u spira, u andro, ge-vesti per u somni kam tegu
vesti, qi pa es ge-denti ex plu poli poda zoa, nu sedi.

Pan proxi an, nu es plu skoria de plu ge-uti fumi ra e plu vasa,
mero ge-vora flu.  Ante de an, nu es u lami stru ko plu zero
dina gono e qi nu feno posi kade.

An nu tenta trovi u loka pro u litera meka inter plu grega
de plu meso-puri papira lami.  An nu zero pote bali ab plu lami,
kausa u skoria vasa pre nu habe sati e plus.

E plus-co, inter plu zero ge-reakti nota e place, posi, nu es

..

As for the Glosa style, within each sentence I find it no-facil
for several reasons, mainly the fault is in Glosa itself, but
also the structure is too disjointed, like a typical idiomatic
run-on sentence in English, even adding commas doesn't help,
but a strict adherance to SVO + prepositional phrases would.
An auxlang should maximize the reader's comfort by using simple
standard patterns with a much higher frequency than would a
natlang. Especially one that relies so heavily on syntax.

I don't think the use of disconnected "ra" is legal in Glosa,
that's one of the special suffixes (all of which I dislike)
that need to be hyphened to their roots for clarity. BTW, if
Glosa used noun-adjective word order (as it probably should)
then the particles like U PLU etc would best hyphenate too.
One feels this especially when a line break intervenes.
Some people hate Glosa's hyphens, but I like them ...
