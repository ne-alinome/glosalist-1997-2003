Karo plu Glosa-pe,

Some interesting NPs from "Language Planning" to
analyse.

~English mero de mikro English - French marsu lexiko~

~U logika ge-face verba-lista~

~u nu ma de sati verba semani lauda alo no-lauda~

~u mo-kilo verba limita~


Grammatical Errors?

A prima vista posi id feno u no-spe ergo de face u
verba-lista; qi fu sati panto nece volu de
interkomunika; sed inklude ne ma de, posi, u kilo basi
verba. 

I guess ~u kilo basi verba~ is not a valid NP, 
as ~verba~ is plural here.

Should it be ~mo kilo basi verba~ or just
~kilo basi verba~?
Would ~plu kilo basi verba~ mean 
"several thousand basic words"?


~Kron na vide u difere inter "thread - twine - cord -
string - rope - tow"; na solo kumu nima epi nima pro
qo es, a fini, u metri-difere.~

Shouldn't this be ~pro qod es~?
[~qod~ = "that which~]

Saluta,
Nick

*  This is, I believe, the nub of the problem!
   For reasons of Glosa's:-
      lack of P-o-S markers on the actual words,
      lack of inbuilt "redundancy,"
      optionality of Noun-Marker particles and Verb-Marker particles, 
I consider that it is not simply good sense to edit, and possibly revise,
Glosa prose, but nigh on a necessity.
   Needless to say, such post-writing editing ought to be preceded by the
pre-writing re-think.  This very first stage of Glosa communication
involves running the phrases, of the intended sentence, through the mind
prior to committing them to type/sound.

N.B.  This is the missing phase: were we learning a pre-existing language,
we would allow ourselves to be inundated by cassette recordings of the
SPOKEN language, and would thus receive conditioning that automatically
caused us to use the common syntax of the language.
      However, we have only articles from PGN plus a few children's stories
to act as examples of Glosa prose, and there are a few mis-usages even
within this meagre corpus; as well as that, we must make up for the lack of
childhood learning of Glosa, and need to do .. consciously .. what children
unconsciously do, when learning a language. 
      So, in running our Glosa phrases through our heads before sending
them to this List, we are mentally checking them for all of the things that
children take years, of trial and error, to achieve.
      Worse than that, it would seem that Glosa's syntax options are not,
as yet, ^set in concrete.^  So, in writing Glosa, we are still part of the
'research process.'

*   1. Yes, we can make unwarranted assumptions about the reader's ability
to follow our train of thought.
    2. The acronym PoS (or P-o-S) was invented, originally, to cover the
'part of speech' markers that are attached to words, such as -LY, -ED, -S
in English, terminal vowels in Esperanto, and possibly Verb inflections and
Noun suffixes, in general.  
     The PoS acronym could, by general consent, be extended to include the
u/plu\pa/nu/fu particles, but I suspect that this would be building a
confusion into the already well-packed concept.
     My preference is to keep the concept of PoS markers as describing what
Glosa has NOT got, while using the NP/VP marker labels to cover the concept
of Noun Phrase and Verb Phrase markers, which Glosa HAS.
     And while I am convinced that U/PLU often has no semantic meaning -
and all they do is denote the start of NP - I am not yet convinced that
tense/aspect particles, which do change the timing of the action of a
sentence, can accurately be described as VP markers: although they do, in
effect, indicate the start of a VP, 
this is not their prime function.

*  A. In simple sentences it would represent an unwanted redundancy to use
both a pronoun and U/PLU.
  EG  Mi feli pa bibe u lakti.
      U feli pa bibe u lakti.
      U mi feli pa bibe u lakti.*
      Mi u feli pa bibe u lakti.*
   B. Yes, despite Ron Clark's original dictate that any word can function
as any part of speech, we have had to add the moderating phrase, 'within
reason', to make the statement rational.
 IE  Any word can function, within  reason, as any part of speech.
   C. In Old Glosa, the ES was 'extended' to ESO to create the lexicon
entry,  ESO = essence.  While ~eso~ is neater than the G.I.D. ~esentia~,
the new word overcame the criticism that a P-o-S marker had been introduced
to change the 'verb' to a 'noun'.

    We could put the question to Wendy.
    Please note, I will use the 'man-in-the-street' logic here,
and will take a guess that yer average pedestrian will not bother to put in
an extra word for which he can see no functional purpose.
So, I too, will ^vote with my feet^ and always elide the ~u~ when talking
about "my book."

>Compare - ~epi u tabla~ = ~epi tabla~.

>
*   Well, ~epi tabla~ is telegrammtic, and possibly a 'North country' style
of Glosa;  ~epi u tabla~ could probably be called "educated Glosa."
    The  ~mi mo bibli~ [my one book]  example shows that in this case
English and Glosa syntax and semantics are identical.
    There is one book, and one of me: I can, if the situation demands it,
stress that it is my only book; alternatively, if it is just a book, but it
is mine, I can simply say so.

     Mi mo bibli   =  My one book
     Mi bibli      =  My book       BUT
     Mi u bibli   --- My the book   make little sense in either language.

    I suspect that we are getting caught up with the concept of "agreement."  
    In French, the determinant agrees in number and gender with the noun.
Even in English, we have a sort of 'agreement' 
  "Three books"  vs  "One book"  ...and even
  "He goes"    while   "They go"
   In both French and English we can interpret the situation as a form of
"redundancy," with one bit of the sentence backing up info in another part
of the sentence.
   There is NO AGREEMENT in Glosa: plurality in one word is not shown in
another.
  ~Tri bibli~   vs   ~Mo bibli  ... Number is NOT shown in ~bibli.~
  ~An ki~ and  ~Mu ki~   ... The ~KI~ gives NO idea of the Subject.

   I admit that Glosa's lack of agreement could be seen as a Linguistic
weakness.  In plain terms, this means that the 'number' attached to a
possessive pronoun refers ONLY to the person(s) it replaces, and NOT to the
quantity of the objects the person(s) own.

>That ~mi~ is "singular", doesn't seem to be relevant.
>As ~na~ is "plural", what does ~na bibli~ mean?
>
*   ~mi~ is singular, and relates to the PERSON only: it give no
information about the number of things belonging to that one person; there
is no agreement.
     ~mi bibli~ as in English both words carry singularity:
              = one book + one person
     ~mi plu bibli~ as in English the presence of more the one book forces
us to raise the object from the ^resting state^ ~bibli~
which can be read as ~(u) bibli~  to the plural state - denoted with the
additional "-S" in English, and indicated with the additional particle
~PLU~ in Glosa.  In Glosa the number of books and the number of books DO
NOT get mixed together: they are quite separate pluralities:-
             |        Books              |
             |___________________________|
             | one      |   two or more  |
_____________|__________|________________|
        one  | mi bibli |  mi plu bibli  |
People  _____|__________|________________|
        two  | na bibli |  na plu bibli  |
_____________|__________|________________|

*   This is a shrewd observation.
    Yes ~bibli~ on its own can be little other than singular, but whether
one telegramicises the sentences to omit further use of ~u~
is probably a matter of style and/or expediency.
    On the other hand, eliding subsequent use of ~plu~, once plurality had
been established could be more tricky: the object could appear to keep
changing its state of number, so it might be prudent to continue to add the
plural particle.

   In context, the others would do, but are open to ambiguity, as Charles
points out.Yes, tense particles and NP indicators are nice, but by
repeating the pronoun, ~an~, both of the disputed sentences, above, would
have been disambiguated:-

   ~An don auxi a mi.~    --->    ~An don an auxi a mi.~

   ~An don a mi auxi.~    --->    ~An don a mi an auxi.~

Saluta,

Robin
  P.S. I disagree over semantics: I do not see it as a weak excuse; but I
do see it as a significant, but missing, part of the Glosa story.  My guess
is that Auxlangers question its relevance because they put it in the ^too
hard basket^.    R.G.

*  This info is not what I would have given you.  I would have said the

(GE-) to form the Past Participle.
  EG  Po nona hora u meteo gene frigi.
      After nine O'clock it gets cold.

      Tem meso-nokta, an pa habe dificili ko an plu ge-frigi digita.
      At midnight, he had dificulty with his frozen fingers.

   Regarding DU, this is an abbreviation of DURA [to continue], and is
usually found as a tense particle giving continuous aspect.  However, as
Charles points out, it should also be the prefix for the Present
Participle, preferably hyphenated (DU-).
  EG  Intra u parka, an du kursi peri u dendra.
      In the park, he is running around the tree.

      Plu du-vola mari-avi pa voka ad an.
      The flying sea-birds called to him.

   Glosa DU gives 'verbs' continuous aspect [= -ing], and DU- converts
words to the Present Participle [= -ing] having the function of an
adjective.  GE- [= -ed] converts words into the Past Participle.

Which would imply that Glosa is, for any speaker that has
not already heard/read reams of Glosa prose, inappropriate
for spoken speech. This does not affect my primary Glo/sa
purpose, which is distributing information via web
(written) information. However, it does raise concerns
about use as a complete IAL.

I am trying to remember to use the NP/VP terminology
instead of PoS.

I increasingly wonder if we don't need an explicit VP
marker for use where you don't wish to use a tense word or
where the tense word wouldn't come first.

Back to my original sentence: ~mi volu auxi~ (I want to
help). It seems that it is nearly _impossible_ to use auxi
as a verb, because it will be interpreted as a noun.
Instead, you must say ~mi volu dona auxi~. It bothers me
somewhat to have a word that could perfectly legitimately
mean "to help" unusuable in that role.

Meno tri, na pa visita un urba Ronda(); qi es kali e fo stimula.

e=and, es=is, fo=very, stimula=interesting, kali=beautiful, meno=month, 
na=we, qi=which(conjunction), tri=3, visita=visit, un=a, urba=town. 

Punctuation:-
Punctation separates. We separate "tri" and "na" slightly because we expect S 
first , the comma tells us that S is not where we would expect. The "." 
separates the sentence definitely from what follows. In my sentence, I want 
the S V and O to flow smoothly and without interuption, "qi ....... 
intereste" is part of O being a post modifier of "Ronda", the conjunction 
"qi" joins the clauses however the ";" separates them! The "qi" and the ";" 
contradict each other!

so:-
Meno tri, na pa visita un urba Ronda() qi es kali e fo stimula.

> However, it does raise concerns about use as a complete IAL.

It's always necessary to revise/edit/polish writing.
And spoken fluency requires constant daily practice.
Can't have a language without a speech community,
but the reverse is true also, which is a problem.
So the duty of the Datuval (language designer) is
to provide people a very solid and simple grammar
plus starter vocabulary ... then let go (release).
Glosa hasn't evolved that far yet.

> I am trying to remember to use the NP/VP terminology
> instead of PoS.

I think of POS as also standing for "piece of s#!t" because it
represents the outmoded grammar-school grammar. But, Glosa
really does have the bare theoretical minimum of 2 word classes:
full lexical words, versus grammatical particles. Some of them
straddle the fuzzy middle, so I suggested that all particles
be shorter (3 letters or less) than all full-words (4 or more).

> I increasingly wonder if we don't need an explicit VP
> marker for use where you don't wish to use a tense word or
> where the tense word wouldn't come first.

The particle "i" is used in Tok Pisin, though disappearing
from common use. In Glosa any of several "auxiliary" verbs
indicate the start of the verb phrase; similarly for NPs.
But not if those particles (e.g. DU and GE) are also
used as derivational affixes (e.g., as participles).
With poor design, good implementation is impossible.

> Back to my original sentence: ~mi volu auxi~ (I want to

Verbs in every language are created by noun incorporation,
that is their essential nature. Only auxiliary particles
can carry verbiness (can't say "verbosity" here). So the
natural solution is "mi vol auxi" where VOL is some sort
of verbal mood particle. For fun or extra discredit:
How about a vocabulary of 100% bisyllabic natural roots,
particles created by elision of the cosmetic final vowel?
Hmm, could reserve -a for verbs, -e for nouns, ...

if reasonable references and contexts to language segments are given:-

all Glosalist postings;

situaltion quoted in Glosa segments;

   + There is a fine line between "to(towards)" and "at" in English: we can
physically feel the difference between 'running to the door' and 'running
at the door'; one hurts, the other doesn't.  In this case is it "At first
view .. " or "Towards first view ... "?  The GID carries   at   =   topo, to.
     TO is the abbreviation of TOPO, and most suitably translates the
English language meanings of 
                             at(place)  =   to

  = To spell it out in six words, not four, is not a gabble, but a kindness

  = I'd say this is another case of "agreement" confusion.  It is NOT ~u
verbi~ but ~u kilo~; needless to say it is badly chosen usage to have,
here, the Glosa NP indicator instead of the suitable numeral.
  = with the numeral replacing the NP Particle, all is clear, and the
phrase cascades suitably from start to end, with each word adding to the

Thanks for your email on this which has been forwarded to me since I was
secretary at the time. As far as I can recall, the translator was indeed
Wendy Ashby. About ten years ago now she wrote to us about Glosa. We asked
if she'd translate something in Glosa and she did. When the internet came
along we decided to put it on our website.
If it was her no wonder the Glosa is perfect!

Hi Sid,
  Glad you found all the lost items again.
  I'd put it down to the 'organic' way Spanish architecture works, and I
might guess the street-plans in medieval towns were constructed as mazes.
  At least you've been there, and have lived to tell the tale.

Happy Travelling,

Robin

Interestingly, earlier today I updated my Glo lists to
distinguish between ~ad~ (toward [direction]) and ~to~ (at
[position]). I realized that the "at" in ~ad~ is like in
"the ball came at me quickly", not like in "I am at my
office".

I would have thought that ~kron~ would be "at a time",
rather than ~tem~. If you're talking about one specific
moment in time, anyway.

~tem meso noktu~ = around midnight (literally, during the
middle part of the night)

~kron meso noktu~ = at midnight

Ja?

Kevin

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 6 Apr 2002 22:19:23 -0800 (PST)

I have tentatively added my first non-Glosa word to Glo:
~susta~, meaning: sustain, support, prop (support), hold up
(support)

Unfortunately, the only GID word even close to this concept
is ~tena~, and ~tena~ is overloaded with too many meanings:

1. clutch; grip; hold (1); restrain (1)
2a. hold (2), keep; contain; stock (store); preserve (1);
2b. conservation; maintain; retain; preserve (2); 
3. restrain (2); 
4. support; sustain; uphold

[I've listed words twice when their intended meaning is
ambiguous]

Also, ~tena~ is very close to the spanish 'tener', which is
to hold. I would prefer to avoid using this "false friend"
for sustain.

I'm open to other ideas, but I haven't found any reasonable
alternative to ~susta~. I am especially interested in any
alternatives that might be closer to Greek or Latin.

Side Question: How do you (the collective group) feel about
me posting Glo messages to this Glosa list?
1. Appropriate and/or interesting
2. Irrelevant and/or boring, but acceptable
3. Annoying and/or inappropriate

Kevin

I think this is to do with the semantics of ~volu~, which
has the implication of wanting to receive something,
rather than to the syntax.

~Mi volu aqa.~ [I want (some) water.]
~Mi volu auxi.~ [I want (some) help.]
~Mi volu bibe.~ [I want to drink.]
~Mi volu dona auxi.~ [I want to help.]

Compare ~tende~

~Mi tende bibe.~ [I intend to drink.]
~Mi tende auxi.~ [I intend to help.]
~Mi tende gene auxi.~ [I intend to be helped.]

continue the Interglossa trend, but then decided to ^go back to the

like trying to stand on quicksand.  The whole of the Eighties was an
uncomfortable decade for Glosa supporters.

    Yes, Nick has put it into a nutshell.
    There is only one snag: before we look at the corpus of written Glosa,
to analyse it academically, we should also have tried to get the 'feel' of
the language - from the inside - by attempting to write Glosa prose.
    This is one skill that I exhort Glosa-pe to practise and develop -
prior to making pronouncements on how they think the language ought to be.
    Even if some of us spell it ~verbi~ and others ~verba~, such
idiosyncracies need not stop us from working on the where the word for
"word" goes in a phrase, and what the Glosa-user can do with the "word"
concept.
    Here I ^lay a Joker on the table.^  Ever since Ron declared Glosa to be
a "concept language", and I absorbed this idea, there have been continual
criticisms of the idea - in that many have said a language cannot be
decribed as a 'concept language, like Chinese.'  This barrage of criticism
has not stopped me from thinking of lexical items in Glosa as
"concept/words."  So, I resurrect this idea for the consideration of those
who have not heard it before.
    There are solid objects and less tangible qualities in this world; and
there are written/spoken words, which have been set up as symbols for us to
use to manipulate the ideas related to to these real-world events and objects.
    Some languages imply a fairly concrete relatioship between the
tangibles and intangibles of our experience, and the symbols used to
describe them.  Other languages suggest that their symbols can be taken as
more abstract representations of the real-world, and are, hence, more fluid
in their relationships between experiential things and the symbols that
represent them.  If such a spectrum of languages, from concrete to abstact,
does, in fact, exist, then Glosa is at the extreme 'abstract' end 
of this spectrum.
     For those who are offended by the Abstract/concrete Spectrum theory, I
duly ^remove my Joker from the table.^  For others, I invite you to look at
languages with which you are familiar, and to see if you percieve any 
differentiation between them in the degree to which they have the quality
of 'abstraction' built into their structures.

     I suspect that a consideration of the quality of the symbolism
inherent in words is critical to our activities in attempting to place
these word/symbols into some syntactic order.

*   I hope that there is a sentence structure paradigm just waiting at the
next corner, ready to jump out at Kevin, and grab him!
    Glosa is not supposed to be as confusing as Kevin finds it, and nor,
from my experience, is it.  Having met Ron Clark in 1977, and maintained
contact with the authors ever since, I would certainly  soon have given up
Glosa, and taken up another hobby, had my experience been as Kevin's.
    I suppose that a love of language, or even a knowlege of good phrase
and clause formation in English, would make all the difference.  It is my
belief that idealised Glosa has classic phrase structure and clause
structure.  Ron did select elements of language from different linguistic
sources to meld them into a 'language of best fit', and this is what Glosa
is now supposed to be: best sounding, most recognisable vocabulary, with
most rational spelling, and the best sentence structure, all capped by the
simplest of grammatical forms. 
    Getting back to "best sentence structure", which is where we came in,
this was perceived as being that of English.  I hasten to add that English
sentence structure was not chosen for Glosa because of Ron and Wendy's
nationality, but because, on objective grounds, the structure of sentences
in English comes out as being the most logical.
    I must add that all vernacular English does not have logically written
sentences.  However, in well written English, it is possible to use the
sentence structure to convey all nuances of meaning.
    
    Being curious about this, I asked myself could any mechanism have been
at work, to cause the present language of the British Isles to become more
logical than the host of other national languages.  On reflection, I mused
that the successive waves of invaders into Britain had resulted in the
imposition of many language tradition on the people of England.  After
thinking about it I percieved an evolutionary mechanism at work:-
   . With Briton, Germanic, Norse, Roman, and subsequent, colonial inputs,
the vocabulary was greatly enriched, while the population experienced a
number of grammatical systems;
   . By a process of natural selection operating at levels of both
vocabulary and grammar, the people ultimately decided which vocabulary and
grammar they would retain;
   . On a mutual exclusion principle, not all words introduced to England
would be retained, and similarly the remaining grammar would be a blend of
the best of the structures that had been introduced;
   . In this evolutionary story, "best" means most comfortable and most
useful.
   & Whether anyone can say that, because of the great number of linguistic
inputs into Britain, English is one of the most evolved languages in the
world, I do not know.  But it looks that way to me.

  DANGER: For reasons of not wanting to hurt any culture's national pride,
it is Politically Incorrect to say that any language can be BETTER than any
other language.  Publicly, we can say neither that English is more evolved,
nor better, in any way, than any other language.
 
  But, to return to the theme, Ron Clark was intent on forming a language
that melded the BEST characteristics found in the various national
languages; and it just so happened that he noticed the sentence structure
of English was better than that of other  languages.  An ancient text book
on 'Parsing and Analysis' would clarify the picture.

*   This is true.  However most people use English within well-established
syntactic guidelines; and we will quickly recognise it if someone's word
order is at fault.

not' variety.
    I might dispute this claim that Glosa is not natural - and so might
Ron, if he were still here.  While Glosa did not get formed "naturally",
the authors planned it to be in conformity with the functioning of the
human brain, and, thus, naturalistic!
    Ron's reason for not writing a Glosa Grammar was two-fold: firstly, he
did not wish to impose an intellectually-derived set of rule on Glosa
learners; and, secondly, he felt that such a guide was unnecessary, because
Glosa was designed to be in tune with the way people spoke 'naturally,'
anyway.

  People should use the amount of marker words that makes them feel
comfortable; and if they write telegrammatically, but no-one reads their
prose, then they should add more small function words.

Central Glosa says, "An amusing and happy coincidence is
that the Passive Past Participle GE- happens to coincide
delightfully with the German as in, for example, GE-brochen,
broken."

I think I figured out what's wrong. Volu and Tenta (and
others) actually have two meanings. English happens to use
them in two ways, and Glosa has inherited that "feature".
Perhaps Romance languages do as well--I haven't checked.

Anyway, in an analytical language, I think it is important
to have different words for:

I want to go home
I want pickles

I will try to help you
I will try the grapes

If we know that ~volu~ means "want to" then we know to
expect a verb to follow. On the other hand, if ~volu~ means
just "want", then we would expect a noun. Same for tenta.

In Glo, I suspect I am going to split any ambiguous verbs
like these, to help make it easier to write clear
sentences.

I know there are several folks out there with more
linguistic experience than I have. Am I on to something
here?

Kevin

VOLU can mean "to want/desire" (verb) or "a/the want/desire" (noun).
It would be shortened to VOL if used as an auxiliary verb often enough.
The main verb would normally appear in infinitive form; Romance langs
use infinitive suffixes -R or -RE, English uses prepositions TO and FOR.
(In Occidental it's like, "Yo vole auxiliar" or "Yo vole assister".
That way the end of the verb phrase is certainly clear enough ...)

There seems to be two different cases here.
Try replacing with an English synonym.

I desire to go home
I desire pickles
I will endeavour to help you

but

* I will endeavour the grapes

So "try" has two meanings and "want" only one.

Nick

Good point, although I'll have to think about it more to
see if I agree. 

After I sent my message, I realized that "I want grapes" is
actually ambiguous. Do I want to _have_ grapes, _eat_
grapes, _get_ grapes, _see_ grapes, or something else? It
seems that in English we are eliding a verb because it can
be inferred by context.

"Try" seems to fit the same pattern: trying a grape might
be trying to _eat_ it, or _look at_ it, or _wear_ it.

So, perhaps ~volu~, ~tenta~, and other words with a similar
pattern MUST be followed by a substantive that is acting as
a verb. It seems like an odd exception, though, and hard to
enforce. So I did some research, and found that...

This whole discussion seems related to the "Modals"
category in the Glosa Basic Reference. But I'm not sure if
it is exactly the same. 

And the real problem seems to be with English, where
certain words can be used as modals _or_ verbs. I think
Glosa wants each word to be just one or the other.
Otherwise, how can we know whether the following word is a
verb or a noun? The word itself isn't decorated. The only
other indication would be to _require_ an NP marker at that
point. But that means that the _absence_ of a marker is
itself critical, which seems risky.

As you can tell, this is currently a big stumbling block
for me.

Kevin

There is an article about to(po) and lo(ko/ka) in
PGN No. 71, March 1995, p. 4:
"to(po)" is a place, which is only a point without dimension,
"lo(ka)" is an extended place, an area.
I hope, I have made it clear in the last dictionary update.

I think, that "to" means only a location and not a time.
"Point in time" would be "kron", a longer time "tem".

Subject: [glosalist] styles in Glosa
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Tue, 9 Apr 2002 06:35:22 EDT

Tried to assemble some sort of syntax from sentences in PGN.
Found it very difficult. It looks as though there are several different 
styles of people's Glosa that vary markedly.
Basically, X(extra) S V O O X seems set in some sort of rather gooey stone 
(not all used each time of course) but the phrases can be very fuzzy edged 
and decidedly vague. A good thing to have this variety perhaps .......
There is poetry (I prefer to call some of them "word pictures") with no 
syntax, Some are in "English Style" where the syntax is that of English and 
the English words exchanged for Glosa ones, I have used both of these styles. 
What we seem to lack is a mundane, perhaps dull, tight, clear and precise 
style that would have helped me to find my errant camera.
Shall try but just now, must collect my brushes and wander off to the local 
art club.

It is pretty simple in concept, just an alternation of verb and noun phrases.
Phrases are precised to whatever degree desired via tense/number/etc particles.
The problem lately is that several people insist they can elide as many
grammatical particles as they please, despite excessive ambiguity.

And what if those goals were not reached but are still attainable?

No, from my own direct experience and study I know that French and Spanish
are just as logical in sentence structure as English. Such linguistically
naive (and insulting) opinions will not be well-received in the world.

> After thinking about it I percieved an evolutionary mechanism at work

All langs evolve over time, as will Glosa after its inventors are gone.
(I assume that there will be another attempt to revive Lingua Franca.)
Inflecting langs tend to go analytic/isolating (Latin -> French -> English).
But the process continues beyond that; Egyptian went several times around
the typological loop (because it was long undisturbed by foreign influence).
For more-logical grammar, see Quichua and Turkish and Ido (agglutination).

Some languages are much easier to learn than others. Some are more expressive.
Some are prettier in sound. Some are more logical in structure. There are
more dimensions I forget at the moment, and all languages can and do vary,
though over time they tend to drift back toward the center of each "scale".
Overall, there is no detectable difference between the major world langs.
A well-designed artificial language can maximize some desired traits,
but it's impossible for untrained monoglot amateurs to accomplish.

> Publicly, we can say

I just say what I mean and mean what I say. Some big companies are in
big trouble here because they "kept two sets of books" (Americal idiom).

Better in some ways. I like the Glosa "analytical" ideal, but there are
some drawbacks. French and Spanish speakers (and about half of all others)
strongly prefer adjectives to follow nouns. Chinese (and half the rest)
are accustomed to the relative clause preceding the noun. Turkish and
Japanese (and etc) want the verb phrase to be last in the sentence.
Glosa cannot accomodate them, Esperanto can (with its free word order),
and English speakers already have English. I can write a computer program
to relex English into nice-sounding nicely-spelled short CVCV words,
but that doesn't make a great world auxiliary language.

Upon further reflection, I realize that if we ALWAYS mark
direct objects with u or plu, the whole problem goes away.
Simple. No exceptions to remember or fret about.

No more stumbling. Glo will require u/plu at the beginning
of any direct object NP, even if the NP starts with ~mi~,
~mo~, etc. Similarly, Glo will require nu/du/pa at the
beginning of every VP, even if the VP starts with ~es~,
~habe~, etc.

One simple hard rule is simpler than several guidelines
with various exceptions.

Of course, I will apply the same rule to my Glosa writing.
Obviously I am in no position to coerce anyone else to do
so.

Kevin

So then, I didn't convince you that ~mi u bibli~ 
is the *underlying* Glosa form, paralleling the 
already excepted ~mi plu bibli~!!

And conventional Glosa would certainly put
~ne~ in front of ~nu~, ~du~ and ~pa~ in VPs.

e=and, es=is, fo=very, stimula=interesting, kali=beautiful, meno=month, 
na=we, qi=which(conjunction), tri=3, visita=visit, un=a, urba=town. 

Punctuation:-
Punctation separates. We separate "tri" and "na" slightly because we expect S 
first , the comma tells us that S is not where we would expect. The "." 
separates the sentence definitely from what follows. In my sentence, I want 
the S V and O to flow smoothly and without interuption, "qi ....... 
intereste" is part of O being a post modifier of "Ronda", the conjunction 
"qi" joins the clauses however the ";" separates them! The "qi" and the ";" 
contradict each other!

so:-
Meno tri, na pa visita un urba Ronda(37n5u) qi es kali e fo stimula.

don't like it much ....
Meno tri, na pa visita un urba ko nima Ronda a 35 gradu  nord e 5 uest. U co

~urba Ronda~ and ~nima Ronda~ are both using the same
syntactic pattern. How about ~un urba ge-nima Ronda~?

~co~ would refer to the whole of the previous
sentence. Maybe you mean ~U ci urba~?

*  There is conversational English, and there is a corresponding
'conversational Glosa.'  However, we have all met people who write as they
speak - using English - and we usually suffer from their prose until we get
the 'lilt' of their "voice" in it.  I believe there is good Glosa prose,
and that people can learn to write such .. ^on the trot.^  However, I do
believe that there is even greater scope for sloppiness in hastily,
ill-considered Glosa than there is in hastily and ill-considered English.

     "I want to help."  is the brief form of "I want to help you."

    Where the phrases end ( or merge ) is uncertain in English:-

       I want    to help you.      OR    I want to help    you.     

    It is easier to think of "to help" as part of the compound VP:
  'want to help'.  Then we have our classical  Subj-Verb-Object  structure
.. even though it might only be so, in appearance.  But it stops anyone
from reading the 'help' as a NOUN.
    So, is  ~Mi vo auxi tu.~  unambiguous - as well as being unelided?
 
    But pushing the "unelision" story even further, we could derive,
          ~Mi vo don auxi a tu.~     
    Perhaps the concept, HELP, tends towards 'nouniness.'
    Then,  ~Mi vo auxi tu te akti id.~  leaves us in no doubt that the
concept wears its 'verby' garb.

Robin

*  Sid, Mate,
   Don't get you 'plu frasa' in a twist.  We do what we can with what we've
got.
   And, as you have noticed, Wendy, the remaining original Glosa author,
"cleaned up" you letter prior to publishing it in PGN.
   Well, mate, we, at the "List" end of Glosa might be somewhat
'experimental' in our approach to auxilliary language, including Glosa, but
Wendy might not.

   The 'mass action effect' is the only hope for those of us who value the
presence of what I call the 'logical "that"' in a language.  I feel that
trying to 'kill' a word - especially one for which there is a felt need,
and one for which there is no suitable alternative - is an error.  On the
question of a %punctuational% alternative to using a word in place of the
English "that" in Glosa, I have found that a full colon, ":", satisfies me,
but the semi-colon, ";", does not.  Meanwhile, of course, we do have the
semicolon as an 'abbreviation' for ~; qi~, but that is a different "that."
 EG  His story was that he was sick.    ~An histori pa es ke an pa habe pato.~
    
      His story was: he was sick.       ~An histori pa es: an pa habe pato.~


      His hat, which is red, is enormous.  

      An kefa-ve; qi habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

      An kefa-ve; habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

   It does seem a bit against the grain to elevate all of your non-capitals
to capitals - especially in a written item, which has the non-use of
capitals as its theme.  HOWEVER, i MUST ADD THAT, IN MY OPINION, YOU WILL
FIND LESS MASS ACTION SUPPORTING YOU IN THIS 'MODERN' PUSH TOWARDS USING
ALL LOWER CASE.

   Concerning your impassioned plea:
      ""Nu-pa, mi pa grafo uno English e pa translati id a "Orthodox" 
Glosa ko plu mega litera e plu ";". Mi pa verifi; plu pan verba es in
u "Central Glosa" lexiko.
Nu, mi gene dice; plu ";" es falsi e pluso plu de verba ex "Central 
Glosa"! Mi no pote vikto!""
   I can make no comment without actual examples.  Please share these with
us on the List.

   On the question of translating English to Glosa, I try to avoid this as
much as possible.  I much rather call suitable Glosa words to mind, and
then ^roll them around^ together.  I call this "thinking in Glosa."
   I suggest that this method produces better Glosa prose, than trying to
convert English sentences into Glosa ones; because, otherwise, the English
metaphors and idioms casn often get transferred across the language barrier.

Hang In There, Sid,

Robin Gaskell

*  I understand your desire for 'flow', but I also see the need for 
clause(start) markers, as well.  For those whose prose is not as neat, or
well-thought-out as yours, the use of punctuational sign-posts is a
valuable, and free, indicator of sentence structure.

   On the question of sentence dynamics, I do believe that there is a case
for sometimes slowing down a sentence - through addition of punctuation -
and othertimes, maintaining the flow by avoiding punctuation marks that
might seem suitable, but which would, if present, break the flow of thought.
   So it is a question of  ~ ...; qi ... ~ and its dynamics.

     ~ ...; ... ~      definitely creates a stop.
     ~ ... qi ... ~    runs clauses together, when the casual reader might
not notice.
     ~ ...; qi ... ~   combines the stop with a strong flow .. producing a
pause, which, in my opinion, like Little Bear's porridge, is just right.

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sun, 14 Apr 2002 13:21:40 EDT

I feel considerably more at ease with Glosa after looking at Robin's seminars 
so here is a lump of a sid seminar ......
He uses the NP "the 3 fast loud red cars", I shall add a little:- " Mu pa es 
plu tri celere fo-sono rubi vagona" and see how I get on with reading it.
 1) the VP. I need to know where it starts, where it ends and the head word. 
It starts with the intro-word "pa" and  after the subject NP which is a 
pronoun. It ends just before the object NP which starts with the intro-word 
"plu", its head is "es". easy!
2) The subject NP, because it is a pronoun, starts and ends with its 
head-word. also easy
3) The object NP starts with "plu" and ends with the full stop/period. The 
last word in the phrase is the head as words' importance grows as its 
position moes further on.
So I have "mu" + "pa es" + "plu ..... vagona".
All very easy and clear even for me.
The confusion starts with the pre modifiers "tri celere fo-sono rubi"
Both Robin and Marcel have given the impression the a pre modifier modifies 
the following word. "rubi (Mods) vagona" OK.
"fo-sono (Mods) rubi" I suppose bright red could be described as loud ......
"celere (Mods) fo-sono" a quick sound ??
"tri (Mods) celere)" ?????
A "very long haired man" could be OK
very long + long hairs + hairy man
Sorry Robin, I think you need "plu tri e celere e fo-sono e rubi vagona" 
tri, celere, fo-sono e rubi all have equal status and all modify "vagona"
"a tall and very long haired man" ........
"u alti e fo longi triki andro"
It might be a matter of style whether you use "e" repeatedly or use the 
English comma "a, b, c, and d" but spaces will signal a chain of modifiers 
modifying each other.

sid, I have to agree that what you are saying 
is perfectly correct, according to the description
of Glosa grammar given in the seminars. And,
in fact ~plu~ is also modifying ~vagona~, so it
would be 

~ plu e tri e celere e fo-sono e rubi vagona~
     or
~plu, tri, celere, fo-sono e rubi vagona~

(But for me, the ~plu~ is redundant given
the ~tri~.)

And I wonder if the PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
rules are not an over-simplification.

In English, we only co-ordinate the adjectives, 
when they belong to the same semantic class.

For example- three or four red cars, 
three red and blue wooden cars,
three red chrome and glass cars.

I overlooked the "tri" and "plu" in the heat of the chase. My view is that 
"u", "plu" and a number can introduce a NP so both are not needed together.
What I have been trying to point out at times is that G seems to be aimed at 
Eoropeans especially English. The rules should be basically as simple and 
regular as possible to encourage newcomers and beginners. From there a writer 
can bend the rules depending on whom s/he is talking to.
For instance, I suggested dropping the capitals because some languages, ie 
Hindi, do not use them. If anyone likes them they could use them but 
remembering that they might confuse  other people and even discourage them to 
continue.
I would have dropped English like a hot brick before getting far with it's 
spelling, I haven't continued with French because of it's irrational (to me) 
genders. In spite of the genders, I enjoyed Hindi because it seemed so 
regular. Glosa has probably lost quite a few followers because it still seems 
to hang on to odds and ends  like capitals, x=ks, q=kw and so on. G appears 
to be heading in the right direction but .......

the roses are very good, they are almost blue and almost light.

the very good roses with almost blue colour and almost light tone.
post mods need preposition

the break in the clause's flow (,) indicates that roses is the head of the

This seems a good plan to me, but I would suggest
a semicolon; in line with the authors preference; 
and view almost blue as elided from 
which are almost blue.

Robins seminars also seem to me to push 
the head final idea too far, as there are a number
of occasions when the head is
qualified/post-modified.

For example -
Days and months: ~di bi~, ~meno tri~, etc
Other ordinals: ~u bibli penta~ [the 5th book]
Postpostions : ~u bileta ab~ [a single ticket],
                ~u bileta versi~ [a return ticket]
Prepositional phrases: 
              ~u-la mega domi proxi religio-do~ 
                 [that big house near the church]
Adjectival Clauses: ~Un andro; tu pa vide pa
setimana;~
                    ~U gina; qi ki peri gono;~
Past participles: ~u bibli ge-grafo ex G B Shaw~ 
                    [a book written by GBS]
Present participles:
        ~plu verba semani lauda alo no-lauda~
       [vocables denoting approval or disapproval]

we normally need to know where the next phrase starts before we can tell 
which is the head of the current phrase. If we use post modifiers, it might 
be as well if they started with a preposition so that we know we are still in 
a phrase. Post modifiers then, would allow us to spread the modifiers about 
so that they don't get jumbled up .The tall,thin, long haired white man  was

Perhaps then, for clarity, only numbers, 
prepostions/postpostions and semicolons 
should be allowed after the head word 
in a noun phrase.

(Ive remembered another example 
~bi anua retro~ [two years ago])

Relative clauses are a difficult problem for the language designer to
solve. It requires a lot of study of actual world languages to do right.
I've already recommended that everyone study Rick Morneau's site,
especially his essay on "Syntax"; Glosa relies almost entirely on syntax,
and the current semicolonic mishmash is probably the single most glaring
error in its grammar, yet is so easy to fix ...

[re-formatted examples follow:]

> His story was that he was sick.
> An histori pa es ke an pa habe pato.

How about using the officially blessed CO and QOD or even just DE?

"An pa dice de an pato." -- "He spoke of his (own) sickness."
"An pa dice de an anas es pato." -- "He talked about his duck being sick."
"An es pato, (u-)co an pa dice." -- "He (is/was) sick, that's what he said."

> His hat, which is red, is enormous.
> An kefa-ve; qi habe rubi kolori, habe enormo metri.

"An kefa tegu qod pa es melano nu es polio." -- whatever.

QOD is ok, but KE is not? GMAFB.

This happened to trigger a concern about Glosa that I've been pondering 
recently:

I'm beginning to doubt whether posessives should (or can) be treated as simple 
adjectives. In this particular case, how do I know whether we are talking about 
"his hat" or a "masculine hat"? If we have "an feli" is that "his cat" or a 
"male cat", and why?

I, too, mistrust "possessives" in Glosa. Possessives along with
numbers and other "determiners" are different from attributive
adjectives in several important ways. At least English can
distinguish "her cat" from "she-cat" ... Anyway, I recommend
once again the creation of a neat paradigm showing where each
particle fits. There should be one for verbal, another for
nominal phrases. A consistent set of terms would be needed
for the classes of words, such as: articles, pronouns, nouns,
determiners, attributives, participles, etc.

But if somebody wants a true Saxon/Chinese genitive,
then I suggest the particle "SU" as a sort of anti-"DE".
Then you'd have like "John SU cat = cat DE John", with
no more confusion about she-cats: "FE cat != fe SU cat".
It's very useful; Chinese have one particle for genitives
that also serves as their only relativizer ("KE").
Drives the French-speakers crazy, though.

Tell me more. I don't like "feli de an" because it is FAR too vague, and DE 
already has too many meanings. How would SU fit into a complex NP?

an su mega, ami feli pa vora.
u paleo, alti, kali an su mega, ami feli pa salta epi u tabla.

?

It _feels_ almost like a verb to me. It's as if it meant "owns", except that it 
actually leaves the focus (subject?) on the word(s) before it, whereas "owns" 
would not do that. I guess my English mind could get used to thinking of it as 
"'s", like John's cat. Hmmm.

If I were looking for a new word to replace DE in a genitive role, do you have 
any suggestions?

    People were getting their wires crossed with all sorts of
"inflections," and it became necessary to distinguish the particular
inflections that had been invented, or had evolved, to specify a word's
function as a particular part of speech.

*   Frankly, I go with the 'natural' order, whereby frequently used
"function-words" are shorter, and the words symbolising concepts are
longer.  So, Glosa particles and a number of function words (conjunctions,
prepositions, verb auxilliaries, negatives, pronouns) are short, and
usually below Charles' suggested cut-off, of three letters.  But some
verboids and very common verbs are also short, for obvios reasons: we don't
want to stumble over unnecessarily long less-important words while getting
to the nub of the story's concepts. (es, ki, vo)  
    My feeling is that a rigid number coding of language is in the realms
of, "Ve haf vays of making you talk."

*   In spoken Glosa, one will need to employ a forced glottal stop, a
cough, or an "er"; but in written, or typed, text, the sky's the limit.  I
have always thought a URL's use of the 'double slash' (//) was very
attractive, and distinctive.  You might try:
     'The cat // sat // on the mat.'
 
    However in sentences with multiple VPs we might find it necessary to
denote both the starts and the endings of such VPs.
    This could be shown:
     Blah blah blah / VP \ blah blah blah blah / VP \ blah blah  etc.
OR
     Blah blah blah < VP > blah blah blah blah < VP > blah blah  etc.

   For most sentences the double-slash should suffice. EG

   Tem an // veni // ad an oficia, an // pa vide // un oficia feli // du
rapidi e alti salta // in un aero.

*  I say, why don't we work on improving this poor design - with examples!?
 First we must decide where the poor performance of Glosa, as a language,
stems from: how much is in the design of Glosa's grammar, and how much is
in poorly thought-out sentences? 
   The sloppiness of the majority of English is quite acceptable - to its
native speakers - because people get used to its funny little ways.
However, English CAN be used unequivocally, and well.
   I suspect that there is a parallel between English and Glosa, here, but
Glosa-users lack the years of childhood ear-training, and Glosa is supposed
to be used at the internationally unequivocal level all the time.
   On top of that, people learning the language assume that the level of
sloppiness acceptable in English should also be available in Glosa.  It is
not.  I might add, that, as in most things, where people are expected to
think before acting, in speaking good Glosa people are expected to consider
the knowlege of their listeners or readers and to qualify their sentences
accordingly.  
   Ron Clark was always using the word, "context," and suggesting that the
speaker's intent would be bourne along by the surrounding situation.
Perhaps he overdid it a bit.
   However, linguists quoting context-free snippets of information are
always going to run into semantic trouble.  And frankly, this could be a
large waste of time: our mate Zamenhoff awarded Esperanto writers a title
for completing an original written work in that language; perhaps he was
trying to encourage his learning community to apply the new language to a
real-world situation, and to do so consistently for a number of pages.
Let's see,
    Robin Gaskell, Grafo-pe
    Is that sufficient reward for writing a few children's stories in
Glosa?   It could be shortened to 'R. Gaskell, G-p.'

   One of the original 'selling points' of Glosa was that, like Italian,
which has terminal vowels facilitating flow, Glosa would also _sound nice_
because it, too, would have vowel terminals.

*  One way of working at this level of language design is to try the
various words out in a number of situations: this is best done through
incorporating ideas of time into written works; and as a result of
variously rolling the alternatives around in your head, and in your mouth,
one seems to feel better, and/or sound better, than the other.  When the
finished sentence is read aloud one usage feels better than the other.  
   The feel of the words in the mouth (probably where language started)
also plays a part in the decision.  Sorry about the "noble savage", but in
my book,  when it comes to language formation, he wins over the clinically
precise mathematician - any day.

*   We do need words to convey the various concepts of time, and a range
has been suggested for use in Glosa:
   nu
   durante
   kron
   tem
   to
 I suspect that there is something going on, psychologically, about 'time',
and that concepts of movement, seqencing, discrete points of time, broader
durations, and approximations all come into it.  The academic linguist
wants a clear-cut concept to fit the words of his lexicon, BUT ... concepts
are seldom clear-cut.  Sometimes we have to let our innate nature speak
directly - without first pasteurising the words by passing them through our
consciousness. 
   For me, ~kron~ always seems to have a question mark attached to it,
in line with,  
    "I did it when I was ready."
    "When?"
whereas ~tem~ seems a softer, unchallenging measure of time.
   I know that this might sound like psychological clap trap, but the
challenge is laid: "Jack and the Beanstalk", "Sleeping Beauty and the Seven
Dwarves", "Rumplestiltskin" and quite a few more are still awaiting
rendition in Glosa.  See how you think about the 'feel' of words after
retelling a children's story in Glosa.

Saluta,

Robin

About DE, it is supposed to be the vaguest preposition; replace with
a more specific "ex" or "ad" or "in" etc as in French, or if one
likes participles (DU and GE?) one could be very precise as in ...
"u-la feli ge/du proprie de/ex/ad John".

Yes, that's the Saxon genitive exactly. Chinese take it a step
further, using it for relative clauses as well.

> any suggestions?

Glosa needs to keep its syntax as simple as possible, so adding
a 2nd genitive can't be a serious possibility especially since
Spanish/French would absolutely hate it and I can't imagine any IAL
succeeding without their support. But it does help to learn how some
other languages such as Chinese/Turkish/Quechua handle genitives,
and basically they do it backwards from Glosa's DE particle.
Glosa is unsophisticated. Its authors knew nothing of linguistics
or history of IALs. Unconsciously they were resusitating Lingua Franca
(good idea!) except for using English adjective-noun order.

I think we're stuck with the DE genitive (and KE relativizer,
despite what Wendy said) but we can safely ignore/abandon the
possessive pronouns, which cause lots of trouble for no benefit.
Sometimes I just can't resist that illegal SU trick, though.

I'm just a civilian. Wendy is the Grand Datuval of Glosa.

Because it is not in our power to revise Glosa. Anyway, what I said
seems simple enough: one particle cannot serve as both verb phrase
*and* participle marker -- these are mutually exclusive uses.

> our mate Zamenhoff awarded Esperanto writers a title
> for completing an original written work in that language

He imitated Schleyer in that. In contrast, others have turned over
control of their languages to committees, encouraging the further
reform and "amelioration" and evolution thereof.

I don't seriously advocate POS final vowels anymore; 5 isn't enough.
So the particles must energize the grammar and determine whether
words are nouns or act verby, etc.

Good idea, badly implemented. Fixable.

Subject: [glosalist] Glo(sa) Sentence Structure
From: Kevin Smith <kevins{at}qualitycode{dot}com>
Date: Mon, 22 Apr 2002 20:58:13 -0700

My Russian Glosa-ami Andrey asked if I had tried creating a BNF model for Glosa 
sentences. I hadn't, but it sounded interesting enough to try. Below, you will 
find my first attempt. I've probably misused and abused some linguistic terms, 
and would appreciate feedback in that area. I've probably also mangled the BNF 
syntax quite a bit, but it seems usable to me.

Note that it is actually a Glo model, but should apply to my own Glosa writing 
with just a couple changes. First, Glosa does not have ~he~ for imperatives, 
~ca~ as a non-tense verb phrase start marker, and ~sa~ as a genitive 
preposition. Second, Glo has slightly different pronouns and "titles", and uses 
~zero~ instead of ~ne~. Third, Glo omits dashes in some places, such as 
~anti-co~ and ~qo-mode~. Those are the only differences I can think of between 
this model and one specifically for (my accent of) Glosa.

I got a few things out of this. First, it is more complex than I would like, but 
I'm not sure it can really become simpler. Second, I think Glo helps in some 
areas by making the rules tighter (e.g. requiring a tense marker or ~ca~), but 
helps in other ways by having the rules be looser (e.g. allowing VerbModifiers 
in any order).

Enjoy!

Kevin

> My Russian Glosa-ami Andrey asked if I had tried creating a BNF model for Glosa

I've raised that issue here before and pointed out Rick Morneau's essay "Syntax"
which walks through the construction of a BNF subset of English -- and I agree
that, especially for a syntax-heavy grammar like Glosa's, this is needed.

> I've probably misused and abused some linguistic terms,

Every natural language stretches or breaks those definitions. I wanted to
mention anyway: http://www.library.utoronto.ca/utel/language/Grammar.htm

Also, on ALT.LANGUAGE.ARTIFICIAL it looks like Ch. Thompson is building
an analytic Glosa-esque language, using some ideas I found interesting.

The main thing about BNF is that it is the first step before generating
a parser. And you can run it in reverse to generate test sentences.
Why remain in the 19th century with Zamenhoff? We can do better now.

Standard Glosa numbers, as I understand them, would be

www.glosa.org now has got a French section, too.


  http://www.glosa.org/brevi/francais.htm

provides the Glosa introduction from the book "Francais-Glosa 1000".
Of course - in the tradition of GEO publishing - it was cruel material
again.  Many thanks to the help of Frans Medaer, Belgium, who
reported 100 (!) (French) mistakes to me, which are now corrected.


>From the same book, there is also a sample text available:

  http://www.glosa.org/brevi/frdaudet.htm .

The funny story about alcoholism is one of the longest Glosa texts at
all.

Syd ponders:

> NPs and VPs have intro particles, What about Adjective phrases?

Adjectives are just components of noun phrases. Many languages
do not even have "adjectives" as a full-fledged part-of-speech.
But what you're probably concerned with are prepositional and
participial phrases modifying nouns. And possibly things like
"a country rich in oil" as described by Rick Morneau. They're
just specialized noun and verb phrases introduced by appropriate
particles (auxiliaries/modals, articles/prepositions). Anything
that uses pre-positioned particles can be handled by simple
Glosa syntax, but participles are currently ill-defined, AFAIK.

My incomplete theory of Glosa grammar is something like this:
There are 2 major classes of words, the regular semantic ones
versus the 100 or so grammatical particles. Any regular word
can be coerced into acting like what are commonly called verbs,
nouns, adjectives, and some adverbs; this is achieved by
pre-posing a grammatical particle of some sort, and sorting
the head word down to the end of phrase. The result is that
one can summarize G grammar by concocting a few paradigms,
chiefly those for the verbal and nominal phrases.

*   Hi Kevin and all,
    Well, there's quite a nest of "holding" words throughout the Latin
dictionary:-
   sus-  indicates "upwards" and is related no doubt to the French `sur`
[on], which seems to come directly from Latin, too.  ~sur~ is Old Glosa for
what is now rendered ~epi~ [on].
   sustineo   = "to hold up, keep up, support, sustain"
   "sustain"  -  sustineo; sustento
   "hold"     -  teneo
   tendo, tentum  =   to stretch, stretch out, make tense,
                       distend, extend  
   sustento   =  "hold up, keep upright sustain; to maitain, 
                       preserve, sustain with food           
 
    So, yes, there is a case for another word, or two, around this area, to
cover the various was of 'holding' and 'sustaining'.
    The brief ~susta~ is adequate for Glo, whilst I might prefer, for
Glosa, something a little longer, indication the derivation, such as -
   ~sustene~
             Also, here, again, I might put in a plug for my theory that
the brain needs time to process the sounds it inputs, and so, the
three-vowel word wins over the apparently more efficient (on a
meaning/letter basis) two-vowel, ~susta.~
    As well, ~sustene~ looks like a different word from ~tena~, whereas
~sustena~ might look like a compound.
    Further, the concept, "to sustain" does include a longer 'time' factor
than that of 'to hold', and often, in the second word,it is only implied.
So there is a case for a Glosa addition - as well as a Glo one.
    I have not researched Roget's Thesaurus in this area, but there could
even be another couple of concepts, not currently covered by Glosa words,
wanting renditions into Glosa.

*   Wendy's comment, in a letter to me, was that Basic English, of approx
850, words proved awkward, and inadequate for higher-level discussion.  She
doubted the viability of Glo.
    In my understanding, as long as there are not too many different forms,
learning Glo, and then moving to Glosa, could possibly be likened to
learning to read and write using the Initial Teaching Alphabet (ITA), and
then, moving on, to using the standard alphabet.

Saluta,

Robin
  P.S. There probably is no other location for Glo; starting up a Mailing
List can be a very slow process - especially when your topic is rather
arcane, as auxiliary languages tend to be.   R.

        qi ge-uti in plu Palaeo Lingua.
      [which used in N(pl) old language]
     , which used in the Old Languages. 

    If ~ge-uti~ means "gets used", then it's OK, but would this usage imply
that the ~ge-~ is used double: giving BOTH the "gets" and the "-ed"?
    I would also feel that the vocal inflection associated with the ~alo
ma~ should be shadowed, in text, by the use of commas.
    And semantically, I am having a little trouble with separating the
numbers for Glosa and for Old Language usage.
 
    So I might turn it around, thus:-
   vice tri alo ma verba, qi ge-uti in plu Palaeo Lingua.
BECOMES
 vice plu tri, alo ma, verba; ge-nece pro un uti de plu Palaeo Lingua.
                              needed for the use of the Old Langs.

*   Good idea, but Glo's vocab is likely to grow far beyond th 500-word

    Your use of ~plus~ as a Verb is quite correct - according to Glosa
rules - but still feels funny.  Am I an old fuddy, Anglophile, or do other
also feel that ~inklude ... in~ or ~adi ... a~ would be more apt?
    IE "include ... in" or "add ... to" rather than "also ... to".
     
    The sentence goes on without stopping: though it is understandable, it
might have a semicolon to introduce the new clause; plus a ~plu~ to neaten
off the plurality; and, for good measure, a word-change from ~idea.~ 
IE
  idea a mi lista de plu koncepa; qi Glo fu nece klu.
 [idea to my list of N(pl) concept, that Glo will need to include] 
  idea to my list of concepts, that Glo will need to include.

*  First to consider this clause:-
     pan na fu   ma   boni   na  Glosa logi
    [all us will more good our Glosa understand]
     all of us will better understand our Glosa

   I suggest that the object of this clause has been placed incorrectly
within the VP.  Re-ordering the clause to ensure proper S-V-O structure it
might look like this:-
     pan na fu ma boni logi na Glosa 
 OR
     pan na // fu ma boni logi // na Glosa  (marking heavily the VP)
           /                    \
           will better understand
     tense part.         'verb'
              comparative  

   Then here is a sentiment which is clear to all:-
      e posi     na fu   akorda de    plu Glosa lega
     [& possibly we will agree  about the Glosa laws]
    and possibly we will agree about the Glosa rules

   Were this my own writing, and I was editing it, I would tease it out a
bit, nouning ~akorda~, and softening ~lega~ to ~regula ~ :-
  e posi, na fu gene akorda koncerne plu regula de Glosa gramatika 
Structure:
   conj. |    prime clause  |    phrase         |     phrase      |

               get agreement
               become agreed
             reach agreement

    So,by portioning out the separate ideas into supplementary phrases, we
can avoid the pressure of pushing too many ideas into a limited space.
Using a non-Linguistic term, I would call it "shoe-horning."
    Also I take the opportunity here to demonstrate the way Glosa words do
not necessarily translate, hard and fast, the exact meanings of English
words: rightly or wrongly, I intuit that Glosa works closer to the deep
structure of language than does English.
While English has mellowed greatly, and is fairly close, in its
psychological structures, to the subconscious language of thought, this has
come about through people (especially children) taking the words and the
grammatical structures, and 'bending' them into more psychologically
comfortable shapes.  Were I to coin a phrase, I might describe English as
"the eternal creole."
    Ron Clark did recognise this creolisation process, and its trend
towards a language that was intuitive and concept based; he tried, with
Glosa, to push the structure of language towards the conclusion of this
intuitional process.  Experience on Glosalist makes me wonder if the human
race is ready, yet, for this stage of language development.

  Ci es u responde ex mi e-posta ad u 'Socialist 
 [here is the response from my e-mail to the 'Socialist]

  In English, the 'phrasal verb' "to respond to" has seeped into our bones.
 Were we to choose another Glosa word to form a 'Glosa phrasal verb' what
would it be: pro, a, de?
  In my sentence, the ~ex~ is NOT attached to ~responde~, as "to" is to
"respond" in English.

  Again, I have teased the ideas out using associated phrases following a
prime clause:-

  |   Clause       |   Phrase    |   Phrase
  Ci es u responde ex mi e-posta ad u 'Socialist 
  | | |           |
  |S|V|    O      |  

>> Party of Great Britain.'
>>   Ja, u Glosa versio de u Socialisti info pa gene

>
*   And here's a meaning for ~ex~, not in _Glosa 6000_: "by".

    On the question of EX vs PRO, it seems clear to me that EX is
'backward-looking' and always refers to something that has 'past'
associations; PRO, on the other hand seems 'progressive' and
'forward-looking'.  Perhaps this reference is to the little-know linguistic
quality, "flavour."

  I get the impression that you have said to yourself, "Aha, that
translates a particular English word, or phrase, thus I can use it in
Glosa, anytime I want to translate that particular bit of English."
           SE  - maybe a separate word in Glo, but was incorporated into
Glosa to give 'the reflexive,' and to be attached to the 'verb' it
reflexes.    EG   U bomba pa explode-se.
                  [the bomb did explode - to itself]
                     The bomb exploded itself.

            CO  - likewise in Glosa this does not occur as a separate
particle ( -CO = the just said).  Where it comes from, I do not know, but
it was added to Glosa not long before the 1992 dictionary was printed (p57
_Glosa 6000_), and was intended to be always part of a compound, EG ko-co,
anti-co.

            ;  - generally suggested for use as a signpost to mark the
start of a phrase, but the special use was in preceding the ~qi~ of an Ad

a big part in the use of a language with "Syntax-based Grammar."
    Here ~tende~ plays the part of a VERBOID, but ~volu~ does not seem to
bend so easily to the Verboid function.
    While some of us wish to use this concept as a Verboid, we might, while
it is still in the GID, use the abbreviated form ~vo~ for this purpose.
   EG   Ka mi vo auxi an, mi pa ki ad an domi. 
   Because I wished to help him, I went to his house.

    I imagine ~vo~ might be  =  wish, would( will-do).

"where" as a conjunction is really ~qi-lo~ [which place].

Yes, I was saying that it is ~qo-lo~ for "where" question and ~qi-lo~ for
"where" conjuction.

I agree with the view of Glosa as a euro-creole. So did the speakers
of the Lingua Franca for over 800 years. And according to Bickerton,
creoles are closer to the human "proto-language". The compiler of
Occidental also believed that Europeans generally are evolving their
languages toward analytic syntax.

SE is a reflexive particle in many euro-langs, except, it has really
become more of a passive than a reflexive, which is very confusing.
I think that in Glosa the passive is maybe GE or ES rather than SE.

>> I have tentatively added my first non-Glosa word to Glo:

We're back to those Roman "super-productive" morphemes again ...
SUB + STARE = English "to sustain" = (poetic) "hold up from below".
I once counted something like 20 productive prefixes that combine
with 200 or so stems to produce thousands of latinate words from
amazingly few elements. That's a good derivational system.

> The brief ~susta~ is adequate for Glo, whilst I might prefer, for

TEN- forms a different word-family in Latin. But I agree that
the usual CVCV pattern is inadequate for super-productives.
In fact, experimentation shows that CVCVC (3 separate consonant
clusters) are needed to disambiguate most of the euro-vocab.
However STA is exceptional and I find SUSTA not bad actually ...

> I might put in a plug for my theory that

I kinda agree with that theory (so maybe you should reconsider it).
Longer content words and shorter particles, for smoother digestion.

> As well, ~sustene~ looks like a different word from ~tena~, whereas
> ~sustena~ might look like a compound.

Follow the Latin spellings rather than false phoneticity and then
suSTA beats susTEN. Better to go completely apriori than to disguise
the well-known roots of our shared Greco-Latin culture. I mean,
adoption of euro-vocab is good but mangling it is counter-mnemonic.

*   The question of optionality comes in here: is the N(sing/pl) marker a
space-filler that is called upon to indicate the NP's start in the absence
of any meaningful NP indicator (assuming that disambiguation is necessary),
or is the N(sing/pl) always assumed to be there and ready to pop through,
no matter how redundant it might be?
    My guess is that this moves over to the realms of the computer handling
of language.  If we are going to raise Glosa to the level of a 'Query
Language' then this "grammar" will be somewhat different from the
Humanly-usable, Glosa Grammar; and, the former will carry the coded
instruction that the suitable NOUN(Singular/Plural) particle must be
inserted at the start of any Noun Phrase, when no alternative NP Indicator
is present.

Saluta,

In my mind, qo can *only* be used for a question, and never for a conjunction in 
a non-question sentence.

18 Steps only uses qo in one sentence that does not end with a question mark, 
and I would argue that a question mark should have been present.

The point was that I think the intended meaning was -
"All of us will improve our understanding of Glosa"!!

~an vive~  =  ~u vive de an~ [the life of him]
~an~ can start a noun phrase as well as be 
a pronoun and be followed by a verb. 

~u an vive~ would mean "the male life".

 I was aiming to convey the idea "find for herself" 
(implying meet and form a new partner 
relationship with) instead of just noticing 
another man exists.

Or "a/the man's life", which is certainly close to "his life".

This is why Glo now has SA to indicate posession. Also, currently, Glo splits 
he/him (AN) from man/male/masculine (ANDRO). So, in Glo:
~an sa vive~ = his life
~u andro sa vive~ = a/the man's life
~u andro vive~ = a/the masculine life

SA has been a surprisingly pleasant and powerful addition to Glo, and I have 
very quickly embraced it both as a writer and as a reader. I heartily recommend 
that Glosa adopt something similar.
