Sometimes we have to 'drop' into another national language for clarification.
    I would like to see subsscribers to Glosalist come up with an inspired
way of interleaving the odd natlang example, without upsetting the flow of
the general argument.
    In this case, English is the missing natlang; I would need something
solid against which to compare the Glosa, that has been translated from
German.  I am not speaking here of the actual words, because, in a poem,
such as _The Wolf_, what needs to be captured is the poet's implied
feeling: this is hard to capture when attempting to "reverse engineer'
other people's Glosa, which has arrived via German.

    I have found in the past that square brackets are generally acceptible
for this sort of thing, EG ['skirted' in Eng. Ver.], or if only one
alternative language is being mentioned, simply [skirted].

**   I must say that it worries me that such a range of possible
translations is possible .. with Glosa.
   In the case of translating potry, however, I veer towards attempting to
maintain the rhythm, and economy of words, of the original.  The pleasant
metaphoric use of English-language prepositions, is unfortunately, I fear,
lost on Glosa, in which the use of non-literal language is to be avoided:-
   "on one side" 
       is not ~epi mo latu~,
       while ~u latu~ seems to lack some specificity.
       I feel that it is not Glosa usage, and ~mo latu~ suffices. 
   "in big drops"
       is neither ~intra plu mega guta~ nor ~in plu mega guta~,
       but, ~per plu mega guta~ [BY big dropS] seems apt.
   Meanwhile, from the forgoing mention of a 'continuous flow', the
'dropping of blood' is already in the plural - from context, and so, the
~plu~ seems redundant.

   On a point of grammar, however, I would suggest that Nick's rendition is
missing a word, leaving the Relative Clause [Adj. Cl.] a little incomplete:- 
  ~ ... hema; qi no-muta-ratio ki kata plu mega guto.~
  [ .. blood, which steadily  fell down big drops.] 

   For me, to make this clause work, I would have to make ~abdomina~ the
NOUN, which was modified; also, I would need to add an ~ex~.
  ~Plu maluka, de hema, pa marka mo latu, de an leuko-iso abdomina; ex 
    [drops    of blood   marked one side of his  whitish   belly,  from

********

The Wolf - Hermann Hesse (1907)

Never had there been so cruelly cold and long a winter in the French
mountains. For weeks the air had been clear, crisp and cold. By day the
great slanting snowfields lay dull-white and endless under the glaring
blue sky; by night the moon passed over them, a small, clear, angry
frosty moon, and on the snow its yellowish glare turned a dull blue that
seemed the very essence of coldness. The roads and trails were deserted,
especially the higher ones, and the people sat lazy and grumbling in
the village huts. At night the windows glowed smoky red in the blue
moonlight, and before long they were dark.

It was a hard time for the animals of the region. Many of the smaller
ones, and birds as well, froze to death, and their gaunt corpses fell
prey to the hawks and wolves. But they too suffered cruelly from cold
and hunger. There were only a few wolf families in the region, and their
distress led them to band more closely together. By day they went out
singly. Here and there one of them would dart through the snow, lean,
hungry, and alert, as soundless and furtive as a ghost, his narrow
shadow gliding beside him in the whiteness. He would turn his pointed
muzzle into the wind and sniff, and from time to time let out a dry,
tortured howl. But at night they would all go out together and the
villages would be surrounded by their plaintive howling. Cattle and
poultry were carefully shut up, and guns lay in readiness behind sturdy
shutters. Only seldom were the wolves able to pounce on a dog or other
small prey, and two of the pack had already been shot.

The cold went on and on. Often the wolves huddled together for warmth
and lay still and brooding, listening woefully to the dead countryside
around them, until one of them, tortured by hunger, suddenly jumped up
with a bloodcurdling roar. Then all the others turned their muzzles
toward him and trembled; and all together burst into a terrible,
menacing, dismal howl.

Finally a small part of the pack decided to move. Early in the morning
they left their holes, gathered together, and sniffed anxiously and
excitedly at the frosty air. Then they started off at a quick, even
trot. Those who were staying behind looked after them with wide glassy
eyes, trotted a few steps in their wake, stopped, stood still for a
moment in indecision, and went slowly back to their empty dens.

At noon the traveling party split in two. Three of the wolves turned
eastward toward the Swiss Jura, the others continued southward. The
three were fine strong animals, but dreadfully emaciated. Their indrawn
light-colored bellies were as narrow as straps, their ribs stood
out pitifully on their chests, their mouths were dry and their eyes
distended and desperate. They went deep into the Jura. The second day
they killed a sheep, the third a dog and a foal. On all sides the
infuriated country people began to hunt them. Fear of the unaccustomed
intruders spread through the towns and villages of the region. The mail
sleighs went out armed, no one went from one village to another without
a gun.

After such good pickings, the three wolves felt at once contented and
uncertain in the strange surroundings. Becoming more foolhardy than they
had ever been at home, they broke into a cow barn in broad daylight. The
warm little building was filled with the bellowing of cows, the crashing
of wooden bars, the thudding of hooves, and the hot, hungry breath of
the wolves. But this time people stepped in. A price had been set on the
wolves, and that redoubled the peasants' courage. They killed one with
a gunshot through the neck, the second with an ax. The third escaped
and ran until he fell half-dead in the snow. He was the youngest and
most beautiful of the wolves, a proud beast, strong and graceful. For a
long time he lay panting. Blood-red circles whirled before his eyes, and
at times a painful, wheezing moan escaped him. A hurled ax had struck
him in the back. But he recovered and managed to stand up. Only then
did he see how far he had run. Far and wide there were neither people
nor houses. Ahead of him lay an enormous snow-covered mountain, the
Chasseral. He decided to go around it. Tortured by thirst, he took a few
bites of the frozen hard snow crust.

On the other side of the mountain he spied a village. It was getting
on toward nightfall. He waited in a dense clump of fir trees. Then
he crept cautiously past the garden fences, following the smell of
warm barns. There was no one in the street. Hungrily but fearfully, he
peered between the houses. A shot rang out. He threw his head back and
was about to run when a second shot came. He was hit. On one side his
whitish belly was spotted with blood, which fell steadily in big drops.
In spite of his wound he broke into a bounding run and managed to reach
the wooded mountain. There he stopped for a moment to listen, and heard
voices and steps in the distance. Terror-stricken, he looked up at the
mountainside. It was steep, densely wooded, and hard to climb. But he
had no choice. Panting, he made his way up the steep wall, while below
him a confusion of curses, commands, and lantern lights skirted the
mountain. Trembling, the wounded wolf climbed through the woods in the
half-light, while slowly the brown blood trickled down his flank.

The cold had let up. The sky in the west was hazy, giving promise of snow.

At last the exhausted beast reached the top. He was at the edge of a
large, slightly inclined snowfield not far from Mont Crosin, high above
the village from which he had escaped. He felt no hunger, but a dull
persistent pain from his wound. A low sick bark came from his drooping
jaws, his heart beat heavily and painfully; the hand of death weighed
on it like a heavy load. A lone fir tree with spreading branches lured
him; there he sat down and stared forlornly into the snow-gray night.
Half an hour passed. Then a red, strangely muted light fell on the snow.
With a groan the wolf stood up and turned his beautiful head toward the
light. It was the moon, which, gigantic and blood-red, had risen in the
southeast and was slowly climbing higher in the misty sky. For many
weeks it had not been so big and red. Sadly, the dying wolf's eyes clung
to the hazy disk, and again a faint howl rattled painfully through the
night.

Then came lights and steps. Peasants in thick coats, hunters and boys
in fur caps and clumsy leggings came tramping through the snow. A
triumphant cry went up. They had sighted the dying wolf, two shots were
quickly fired. Both missed. Then they saw that he was already dying and
fell upon him with sticks and clubs. He felt nothing more.

Having broken his bones, they dragged him down to Saint-Immer. They
laughed, they boasted, they sang, they cursed; they were looking forward
to brandy and coffee. None of them saw the beauty of the snow-covered
forest, or the radiance of the high plateau, or the red moon which
hovered over the Chasseral, and whose faint light shimmered on their
rifle barrels, on the crystalline snow, and on the blurred eyes of the
dead wolf.

*   I have this odd idea that a ~Glosa-pe~ and a ~Glosape~ are two
different things.
    How many of the rest of humanity can recognise the "hyphen" concept?  I
know that Paul Bartlett hates it, and says that people cannot HEAR a hyphen.

    Were I to utter a discrete hyphen, no-one woulld hear it, unless we
forced it to carry a "schwa."  Using English-language pronunciation, the
"a-pe" would sound very different from an "ape" spelling.
    However, using Glosa syntax and pronunciation rules, the Glosa hyphen
can be '''heard''' by the butting together of two words (or word and
affixed particle): there is an audible 'gap' between the two parts!

    With Glosa stress on the penultimate syllable (or last syllable, if the
word/particle comprises only a single), then, using capital letters to show
the stressed syllable, we contrast:-
   GLOsa-PE   cf   gloSApe
   LAna-TEgu  cf   lanaTEgu

    Do people hate the terminal category affixes?
    They seem to go in English, though with no hyphen, EG
   fast     faster    fasten
   bake     baker     baked  
   post     postman   postbox
   water    waterway  waterwash

    So, although you have a case, in keeping the words and particles
discrete .. by banning hyphens, I feel that they are a handy, and
humanly-acceptable device for separating lexical units within a semantic
whole.

    I will agree that the ~ge-~ prefix is a little bit forced, even though
the authors refer us to the use of something very similar in German.
Actually, at the start, the Glosa authors decreed that all Glosa utterances
would be in the Active Voice.  So the Passive Voice, in Glosa is a recent
addition to the language.  The syntactic model is from English, with the
~ge-~ equivalent to the "ed" or "en."

   He is hit(ted) by Fred.      Fred hits him.
   An gene ge-bate ex Fred.   Fred bate an.

   It was taken from the room.        Someone took it from the room.

*   I will agree that the invisible joining of words .. to form compounds
or particle additions .. is un-Glosa, But I still feel that compounds whose
parts are separated by hyphens, are an acceptible form, in which the parts
can be immediately determined by inspection.  Again, in spoken Glosa, the
use of stress readily informs us of the number of parts in a compound.
    I could be shouted down by Linguists, who say that particles attached
by hyphens are affixes; and words compounded using hyphens are simply cases
of morphological change to 'the' word.  However, if the hyphen exists, and
hyphenation has linguistic meaning, then why not use it .. if people can
recognise its existence (visually and through spoken stress), and are happy
with its use.

*   Yes, the question of vocab selection gets back to the foundation of the
language .. and Dictionary production.  I almost feel that to alter a
significant proportion of Glosa's vocabulary, one would be creating
virtually a different language.
    And this comes down to the question of the user-base: who has the
present dictionaries of the language, and what would be involved in
physically replacing these with upgraded versions, IE a Glosa Ver3.

    While, theoretically, a better-designed language could result from
lexical reform, what would be the criteria for the selection of a superior
vocabulasry, and who would choose these criteria.  Were such a project to
be embarked upon, it would take at least another five years - even with the
aid of computers and database programs - and who would do the work?  The
resulting product would probably have to have a distinctive and unique
name: I favour "Lex."  It would not be Glosa, though it might be described
as another derivation of Hogben's Interglossa.
     I cannot volunteer to lead such a project for a number of reasons:
 . age (63),
 . more pressing interests (anti-globalisation, post-capitalism, 2012),
 . loyalty to the Glosa authors,
 . exhaustion at the thought of attempting to work up a user-base - again,
 . a need to concentrate on my survival in retirement.

     However, there is still the thought of the Glosa 2500 project, which I
could be reactivated into - without conflict with any of the above points.
I must ask Bill Patterson where he is up to in Glosa vocabulary reform
process.  The Glosa 2.5K lexicon was supposed to be a streamlined vocab
with virtually no synonyms, additional words - oversights from the original
list, and the selection of the most suitable words where a range of
alternatives had found their way into Glosa.

*   Since I expect the English speaking cultures to dominate, economically,
any ultimate selection of an IAL, I feel that these comments are likely to
point to Glosa's being sidelined in such a bunrush (or is it bun-rush?).

*  This is a distinct possibility, but I feel still only relevant at the
IAL level.  Now, were China, the Asians and Africa to dominate the world
stage, we might be onto something.  I must ask a Chinese speaker how they
see the Glosa compounding - in comparison with the Way that the Chinese
language puts characters together, sometimes side by side, and sometimes
one inside another.

Juncture and tone are both present in most/all languages.
The hyphen is a very good typographical convention
(whereas the Glosa semicolon is insupportable).

If the Greek style of compounding is used (e.g. hydro-plane)
then I see no need for any suffixes in Glosa. The whole idea was
to rid the IAL of confusing morphology, as in pidgin/creoles.

One must distinguish the "inflectional" from the "derivational".
The fast-en suffix is inflectional/grammatical, whereas
the water-way compound is derivational/semantic. I would
reject the one (in Glosa) and accept the other. Then you can
say "Glosa has no morphology, and the easiest grammar".

Interesting. Well, 2 voices seem reasonable.
Plus the "self" pronoun/particle for reflexive.

I think you are right and Paul was wrong on this point - er, dash.

>     I could be shouted down by Linguists,

Who cares about pedants?  Linguists love all languages equally
and say none are better or worse, which is plain silly: I've made
lots of provably worse conlangs myself. So some are better.
Glosa could be made a far better IAL than it is now.

A new vocabulary would be Latin-based, most likely.
I think the current Glosa fans prefer Greek.
So instead of a new language, a better approach
might be to evolve the current one by simply adding
whatever Greek roots seem necessary, using as much
as possible of the current "inadequate" set.

I would avoid the -pe affixes and use only root compounding
via the infamous hyphen. Added roots should use the CVCV pattern,
and be recognizable (unmangled) to those who know a little Greek.
As for the terminal vowel, I guess it doesn't matter, especially
since it is unstressed.

Great idea. I suggest using anything else but M$ Outlook
as an email reader, lest a virus hits again ...
I've run Linux since 1996 and never a crash or loss yet.

I worry about politics, but never concede defeat to it ...
Make a better language and it can help save the world.
Now, how does the Glosa vocabulary handle this semantic field?

Chinese has relative clauses on the opposite side,
but otherwise fits English/Glosa syntax pretty well.
Anyway, the goal is to overcome such dominance ...
