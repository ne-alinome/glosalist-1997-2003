    However, it would seem that in its present state, Glosa can mark
the imperfect with 'du' and has nothing to mark the perfect explicitly.
Ought we to say that if the imperfect is not marked, the perfect is
implied?  Then how do we convey unmarkedness for aspect?

    As a combination of both past tense and perfective aspect?  In
which case the issue arises, as you quoted me below, of why merely this
combination?  Why not every conceivable combination under the sun
of tense and aspect having its own distinct particle?  Why not have
just a very few particles marking things separately, so that one can
make one's own combination at need?

    Glosa has some difficulty with its phonological structure based on
its history which would seem to militate against your preference here.
Following its basis in Hogben's Interglossa, Glosa attempts to maintain
some at least vague recognizability of Greco-Latin roots.  This works
-against- strict CV, VCV, and CVCV words consistently.  It appears that
we can't have it both ways (approximate recognizability versus simple
phonological word structure).

    If you want more CVCV word structure, you might take a look at
Barnett Russell's Suma, in which the words are more or less ad hoc but
strongly CVCV (and related).  At one time I was impressed enough with
the general idea of Suma that I thought about trying to work out a
couple of the kinks and generating a new vocabulary (Russell's is
sketchy in spots).  I even wrote a few simple computer programs to
generate and maintain wordlists (and generated 7200 CV, VCV, CVV, and
CVCV possible words based on criteria).

    It might be a sort of Suma-like phonological structure with a
frater2-like grammar.  Suma's (and my) vocabulary would certainly be
"neutral," in that the words are not taken from -any- natlang (barring
accidental coincidences) and therefore would be equally easy or
difficult for just about everyone.  (One problem with this sort of word
structure is delimiting word boundaries, even if one does not go as far
as Lojban, say, with its allegedly self-segregating morphemes.)

    Thank you.  However, even if I ever did complete a working
vocabulary, I would have no illusions about it taking the IAL world
by storm. :-)

    As I have said on AUXLANG, in my exchanges with James Chandler,
there can be competing values involved in a conIAL design which may
not always be entirely compatible, so that something has to give.
That is why I do not accept what I call the Jespersen Criterion as
a trump card over everything else.

    I don't follow sci.lang any more, but I am familiar with some of

    I agree personally that Esperanto is not as easy as some of its
proponents make it out to be.  I have tried several times and have
never really mastered it.  For passive reading, I find Ido to be much
easier, for whatever reason, about the same ease or difficulty as
Interlingua.

    This is slightly off topic, but not entirely so, I would think.  In
my last post (responding to Charles) I mentioned Barnett Russell's
Suma.  I did not mention that he had a somehat ingenious mnemonic
device to assist learning vocabulary, in that vowel alternations partly
indicated part of speech and partly paired (or tripled) off words with
somewhat associated meanings.  But this sort of device simply is not
available to a language like Glosa if it is to keep to its principle
of maintaining some recognizability of Greco-Latin-derived toots.

    But, what does a field look like?
    Is a field a group of related physical objects, viz animals, clothing,
or or is a field an area of human thought, similar to the categories of the
Roget Thesaurus?
    I have had one thought on this, regarding specialised lexicons.  These
are more 'fields of interest' than 'thing fields or 'thought fields'.
    While everyone can write letters home, about their holiday, using
_Glosa 6000_, if that holiday took in attendance at a conference for
Geneticists, then a couple of additional lexicons might be brought into
play.  The letter might use .biology words not in _6000_, and it would use
words from the .genetics lexicon, that are definitely NOT in _6000_.
    This idea, similar to  "import"  in Java programming, suggests that we
'load up' lexicons, additional to the basic, when discussing specialist
interest areas.

    Pease send your definition of a "field".

    My only thought on it was years ago, when I started asking people what
it would take to produce a Glosa "parser."  What you are suggesting sounds
like an extremely simplified parser: is it?  Is the word, "parser" still in
use, or has something replaced it, now?

    And yes, it always was my understanding that Glosa's style of grammar
set it up for streamlined 'parsing'.  This thinking leads into other
"Middle Language" ideas: that Glosa would make an ideal MetaLanguage for
the interaction of people with 'intelligent machines' in international
settings; and, that Glosa, in its most standardised incarnation, already
comprises a 'meaning representation system' that would hold meaning as a
readable 'Intermediate Language' in machine translation.

*   There are distinct parallels, and in Glosa these are closer, in form,
than they are in English.  But aren't you pushing it a bit too far to
suggest 'verbs' are 'nouns'?
    Though you might have discovered a hidden truth: the brain processes
*things*, and the phrases attached to them, in much the same way that it
processes *actions* and their associated phrases.

>The blank prep means subject (no other prep can be elided, not even

*   So, you are suggesting that a preposition to start a phrase is the
norm, and that a tense particle can be seen as a variant of this
preposition.  Hmm!  It sounds like a good theory, but one which must be
tested against the practice of language.  In Glosa no tense particle is
needed for actions in the present, with ~nu~ only needed to stress the
immediate present.

*   Yes, I have tried hard to propose ways of telling the time and date
that give discrimination in both written and spoken forms.  EG
Q.  Qod es u horo?  [What is the time?]
      OR
    Qe, u horo nu es?  [What time is it now?]

A.  Mo horo.  [One.]
      OR
    Id es Mo horo.  [It is One.]
      OR
    Nu es Mo ho'kron.  [It is now One O'clock.]

   In the above sequence, there is no possible confusion - whichever form
of the question and answer is used.  In a 'context-neutral' auditory
situation, such as on radio, people would give the hour its 'label', and
say, ~Id es nu Mo ho'kron.~.  No-one would hear the capitalisation - which
denotes hour, not date - but all listeners would know that it was an hour
of the day, and not a day of the month, because they would hear the
~ho'kron~, which is a contraction of HORO KRON .. intended to flag the ~mo~
as an 'hour in measured time.'
   All we need to do now is work out if Glosa's measured time is in
twenty-four chunks, or if the archaic "Before, and After, Mid-day" system
is to persist.  I think the Twenty-four Hour Clock is in, for us global
moderns: what does the group think?
   Of course, now with a Networked world and e-commerce, we ought to know
that the actual time, specified by a person in one part of the world, is
understood to be the same moment, by a reciever in any another location.
My daughter's suggestion is that, in Cyberspace, we will use GMT.

   Glosa must pass the "Telephone Test".  Unlike the "Turing Test", in
which we must try to determine if we are speaking to a machine or person on
the other end of the line, in the 'Telephone Test' we know we are talking
to a human, but we want to be sure that we really can ^picture^ what they
are saying.  EG
  [Ring-ring]
  B. Bil ci; Carli, es tu?
  C. Ja, mi es Carli.
  B. Qe, na enkontro qod horo, datu, e loka?
  C. Ah!
  B. Ja, kron e lo?
  C. Na fu unio to Mo-bi ho'kron, datu tri-mo u-ci meno, infra u horo-me
      intra Centra Parka.

   So, Carli and Bil make their arangements, unequivocally, by phone.
   I hope that you can follow their conversation without referring to the
dictionary.  If however, there are any questions in your mind, please
submit your translation: prizes might be distributed for correct entries.

   On the other side of town, Maria and Beti are arranging a meeting for
some months hence,  EG

  M. ...... so tu habe id, ne enkontro bi meno po nu: homo loka, homo horo,
datu tri, Meno tetra.
  B. Ja mi ski: ci, u-ci horo, u Tri de Meno-tet.

   Again, what Maria and Beti say passes the Telephone Test.

This is hardly a confusion in Glosa, even if, in English, they might all
ret down to "that".
    This is more a confusion of English not Glosa!  I will agree that one
cannot hear the semicolon, and this is my reason for wishing to rediscover
the Old Glosa ~ke~, which can be heard.  Whilst experimenting with this
situation, which in my mind is still the "LOGICAL THAT", I attempted to use
~ xxx: ~ when the authors consigned ~ke~ to the linguistic dustbin, and I
feel that it did give more of the right feeling than the semi-colon.  But
this experimental use is 'Robin Glosa' and though logically better, is
neither Kosher, nor audible.
    As in the English-language usage of "that" {third line up, third word
back}, no punctuation was used, nor seemed necessary, viz ".. feel that it
..", I was probably introducing a Noun Clause.  What is a Noun Clause
marker in Glosa, apart from the semicolon, which the authors have chosen to
be the generic clause marker?
    Some time back, still using ~ke~ - before it was relegated - I found
that some times it felt right to use a semicolon (or colon) before it and
other times it did not.  Possibly, it was when starting an Adverbial
Clause, that I felt no need for punctuation; and, before the Noun Clause, a
colon seemed apt.
Present Situation in Glosa:-

u-la   EG  Mi gina pa don a mi u-la kamisa. [My wife gave me that shirt.]
; qi   EG  Mi fu vesti auto in u kamisa; qi habe kloro kroma. [I will
   wear a|the shirt which|that is green.] AdjC
;      EG  Mi dice; na nece ki a domi. [I say that we must go home.] NC
           Id habe ta tristi; mi plora. [It is so sad, that I weep.] AdvC

Possible Future Situation Re Glosa Rendition of "that"

u-la
; qi
: ke  EG  Mi kogita: ke na pote akti id. [I think that we can do it.] NC
ke    EG  An pa ridi ta forti ke an plora. [He laughed so hard that he
   cried.]

    Admittedly, this does bring in two usages of the out-dated ~ke~
differentiated, in text, by the presence or absence of the colon, and, in
speech, by vocal inflection.
    I think the authors 'borrowed' the idea of KE from Esperanto, but then
subsequently felt embarrassed about this, and decided no clause marker
particle was needed, after all, for Adverbial and Noun Clauses.

    I invite other Glosalistas to suggest ammendments to either of these
lists: present or possible.

in Glosa.
    QI, KE, U-LA  ---> "that"
    ES, GENE, EQA, HABE ---> "is"

   I feel that Paul is blaming Glosa for copying the confusions of English,

*   If English has achieved a "logical" quality, then it might carry a few
distinctions that are not present in other natlangs: I trust that Glosa
aquires the 'logicalities' from English, while avoiding adoption of the
semantic overloading that accompanies some of these "logic" words.  I try
to suggest that in Glosa we seek function without equivocation.

    Indeed.  And such natlang confusion should not be smuggled into a

"that" bears in English.

    Vocal inflection is very, very, very, very problematic in an
auxlang which will have many diverse adult learners.  Based on their
native tongues, what seems like a "natural" vocal inflection to one
may seem confusing or even bizarre to another.  I recommend that we
do not depend on vocal inflections to make ourselves clear.

    This has been my point all along.

    You gave an example yourself above, using 'ke' in one instance to
introduce a noun clause and in another to introduce an adverbial
clause.  As charles has pointed out, clause marking is rather vague
(my term) in Glosa.  Why should two types of clauses be marked the same
way merely because they are sometimes so marked in English?  It's too
bad that we don't have some non-native-Anglophones (preferably those
who are even native speakers of non-Indo-European tongues) among us.

    Like most natlangs, English teems with illogicalities.

    Yes, and one aspect of that is to avoid semantic overloading.

>>> "that" has numerous uses which are not at all the same.

The idea of semicolon for relative pronoun is a failure.  If the language is a
real language, and the original "authors"  are *just* authors now, the semicolon
usage can be dropped.

The use of commas to indicate pauses in speech, especially to mark the
boundaries of phrases, is so obvious as to need no justification.  The use of
"KE" should be as "U" in that the speaker may use it or elide it as seems most
appropriate.  Most clear would be to use both, together.

Actually, I don't understand the difference between "QI" and "KE".

The way the web page would work, there would be a fixed format "form", and when
"submitted" a Perl script would run and generate some kind of translated text
results, and send that back as a generated web page. The actual Perl script
could also run stand-alone on one's PC. I think there is a Perl for Micro$soft
win95 and possibly even win3.1 ... The script could be translated into C, I
suppose, but I just don't bother with C anymore.

Yes, but simple and intuitive, useful to a beginner. Colors, animals, plants;
qualities and abstractions; "verboids" and other common actions or relations;
places and directions and body parts; all prepositions and grammatical words.
The trick is to NOT try to partition words so they are in only one category.

My theory on organizing a lexicon is to make ALL grammatical particles 2
letters, consonant-vowel; ALL common base vocabulary words 4 letters, CVCV; and
ALL extended vocabulary 6 or more letters, CVCVCV ... New learners and machine
parsers would be eternally grateful.

    However, I opine that such a language would no longer be Glosa, as
it would involve too much further deformation of roots.  Somewhere
along the line, Ashby & Clark changed Interglossa so much that it was
no longer Interglossa but a different language, Glosa.  At some point,
enough deformation would result in yet another language.  That does not
make the attempt wrong.  (As I mentioned, I kind of like Russell's CV,
CVV, and CVCV language Suma.)  But it would be another auxlang, just as
Ido is another auxlang, no matter how much its advocates try --
unwisely, in my opinion -- to call it "reformed Esperanto."

    'Qi' is unambiguously (?) either a relative or interrrogative
pronoun.  "Ke' is who-knows-what at this point, but I am not aware
that it has ever been intended as a relative in the same manner.

Well, you would be right. So I only advocate applying the "theory" to Glosa to
the extent of making no changes further away from this direction; as it is,
Glosa follows it 90%, which is pretty good. It is too late to change the
relatively few grammatical particles that are non-CV, but new specialized
vocabularies could still adhere to the CVCV... pattern.

    Hope I can negotiate the unzipping.  I will need to print out the file,
or, perhaps, put it on the now moribund 386.
    Mystified about the _Glosa 1000_ words not in the G-E version: they
might have been from other '1000' lists; I laboriously collapsed all of the
Glosa words in the two lists in the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary into one
composite list.
    Will probably allocate time to browse your site, Bill, on Sunday.

Saluta,

Date: Sat, 13 Feb 99 02:3

Hello Friends,
   Apologies for my absence from the cyberways, but I have been
concentrating hard on refining down the _Glosa 6000_ to something more
Nettable.  So far, I am mostway through on my second pass: in the first, I
separated out obvious duplications and abstruse forms; in this pass, I am
restricting the vocabulary even more - in the search for that elusive
optimum Net-Dic.

  Which reminds me of a piece of Glosa Lore.  Once, while talking to Ron
Clark, I said, "I know how hard you have been working - deriving the
vocabulary."  Ron replied immediately: "No you don't."
  Feeling put out, as well as mystified, I asked him to give me some idea
of how hard he had been working .. so he told me the following story.
Once, while sitting at his desk compiling the vocabulary, with about six
national language dictionaries arranged, fan-like around him, and
concentrating hard on finding the commonality among them, a knock came at
the door.  He opened the door, heard the visitor announce himself, and then
attempted to answer.  No meaningful sentence came: what emerged was just a
meaningless string of words and sounds from the compilation work he had
been doing.  I did observe that very few people pushed their brains to that
extent of concentration, and agreed that I had not been fully aware of how
hard he had been working on dictionary formation.

   I am not working as hard as that on the Net Dictionary: if I really
screw up my mind, and concentrate hard, I might approach about one
hundredth of this mind-blowing level of concentration.  But, I've been
doing my best.
   Thinking co-operatively, I have decided to concentrate my efforts on
cutting down Glosa, which I do know, while inviting others, who have better
knowledge of other languages, such as Ido, Esperanto and Interlingua, to
help by checking my work against existing "Lite" versions of these other
languages .. noting glaring omissions in the double filtered version of
'Glosa Lite' that I come up with.

   My criteria during the filtration process have been very simple - I
trust that a third pass through the list, culling even harder, is not
necessary.
 - savagely cutting out synonyms, leaving only one as the selected version,
 - deciding on close concepts, where two different, but close, words seem
warrented,
 - providing a working vocabulary with which people can write passable
letters in Glosa,
 - mainly giving people all the various nuts and bolts of Glosa so they can
experiment with all of the different Glosa forms, as a training vocabulary,
 - trying hard to ensure that there was a token content of substantives to
cover daily activities like eating, dressing, shopping, and taking the dog
for a walk.

   I might ship the list to the Glosalist with a side listing of
near-misses.  I had to be very hard on myself in this culling process, and
moved possible selections to the side, so that I could consider them for a
while, before deleting them from view.  I was thinking of two distinctly
different target populations, while deciding whether, or not, to leave
words or delete them: urbane Neticens and pristine Third Worlders.  This
might explain some uneven-ness in the Glosa Lite I will be posting in a
couple of days.

   Will post this, now.  Writing this has provided a necessary unwinding
for me .. during the process of vocab selection: if I tried too hard, and
ended up spouting nonsense sylables, there is a danger that, at my age, I
might not be able to click back.

   Also, will read and reply to recent posts that have piled up while I've
been at it, a.s.a.p.

Saluta,
 Robin

  NOTES:
  1. I made up ~lo-iso~ for "whereas".  ~iso~ on its own, seemed inadequate.
  2. ~no-alien-abili~ for "unalienable" might seem a bit far fetched, but
it fits Glosa's derivational rules, IE
    NO - "un-", "non-"
    ALIENA - "strange, estrange"; last A clipped due to following vowel
    ABILI - "ability, able"; used also as an 'abstract noun' category
       post-fix
    >hyphens used for tight compounding of concepts.
Thus,  ~no-alien-abili~  translates to  "un -estrange -able".
  3. ~plu ...... privilegi~  [rights]
  4. The whole statement is pitched at the level of abstracts, so I
grounded it by using the simple substantives: in a normal sentence, I might
not have been happy with ~funda~ for "foundation", but to avoid making the
whole phraseology ^top-heavy^, I avoided using compounds for these abstract
nouns.
  5. In English the second "of" is called for by usage; but it really does
not help the flow of this long-winded and awkward phrasing, so, a
corresponding ~de~ in the Glosa rendition was omitted in the name of
*understanding*.  At the start, I could not seem to gather all of the
concepts, referred to, within one idea; however, when I dropped the second
~de~ the ^conceptual space^ did not seem to be too overloaded.
  6. Such stilted use of language really does look like a confidence trick
to me: it is a string of well-sounding phrases and concepts, which suggest
benefit to people, but which is hardly worth the letters it is written with.
  &&&. I cannot actually say that my rendition, here is a good example of
Glosa; but, at least it works, and I was happy that there were no
difficulties with the vocabulary.

   What does the panel think?

 Robin G.

    Translation is always a difficult and even problematic matter.
In fact, I think there is even an entire Usenet newsgroup dedicated
to the subject (and problems) of translation.

    The problem I see with Robin's effort is the old word-for-word
bugaboo of translation.  I recommend that in order for the result to
be clear and smooth Glosa, something more along the line of a Glosa
paraphrase or gloss may be better than trying to come up with Glosa
equivalents for specific English words, such as 'whereas'.

*   Things are falling into place, briefly here are my disentanglements of
Tense from Aspect in Glosa:-

   Tense Particles: PA [past], FU [future] - no present.

   Aspect Particles: PROTO [start], SIO [condional], DU [continuous],
PARATO or PRAE [perfective], NU [immediate;recent;imanent], and RE- or
ITERA [repetitive].

using the analytical method to understand English, while others see it as a

    As a primary school child - aged ten - I was introduced to Parsing and
analysis,and this has sustained my interest in communication ever since.
    I think that when the IAL is in, we will need to give school pupils
instruction in "good IAL style."  Then people will learn from the start
that IAL equivalents of "have heard" are poetic uses of language, and they
will also learn the mechanics of good communication.
    Last time I fielded this idea on Conlang, I was accused of wanting to
tell people how to think, and accused of being a Fascist.

    From Old Glosa I recall using PARATO [already]: by abstraction
(removing A-TO), we can derive the PRA, which seemed, to you, like the
illegitemate product of an unholy marriage between Tense and Aspect.
    Maybe the uncut PARATO is the missing Perfective Aspect Particle; it
comes directly from Latin, but is no-where in the current Glosa
dictionaries.  Oh, yes, did I mention PRAE [before] is in _Glosa 6000_?

*   I reply to this Post in full, because I am Forwarding it to the Glosa
authors for adjudication, or whatever it is they do, when they lay down a
recommendation.
 ------------------------------------
So, Hello Ron, Wendy & Glosalistas ,
    Have we got the Passive Voice sewn up, and is it  ~es ge-X~ [is Xed],
  as Paul reports?
    And is there now a "Perfective Particle" which tells us that something
   is well and truly done with?

    Perhaps I am still using Old Glosa, with ~gene ge-X~ [gets Xed], and
~id pra acide~ [it had happened]?

    Even though I like GENE ["to get"], while Paul does not, I believe that
there is a very strong case for breaking the "is" complex into the original
four variants - ES, GENE, HABE, EQA - that I learnt about some years ago.
So, for me, when the dog bites the man, the man definitely _gets_ bitten by
the dog!  The substantive operating as a full 'verb' is the GENE, while
participle status is conferred on the substantive MORDA
by the GE- prefix.
    Am I being a recidivist, on this, or just plain logical?

  U kani morda un andra.  [The dog bites the man.]  ..... Active Voice

  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani. [The man gets bitten by the dog.] P.V.

  Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.* [The man IS* bitten by the dog.] ??

   Just because years of usage have extended the "is" to precede the
Passive form, does not make it correct communication: this is one of the
things about English usage that I believe should NOT be generalised into
the IAL!

    On the Perfective, I was very happy with PRA, which seems to have
disappeared from the Glosa word-lists and dictionaries.  I did find PRAE
[before] in _Glosa 6000_, but the perfect Perfective, PRA, appears to have
evaporated.
    Is there an alternative particle to allow us to tell the difference
between the idea that something _has_ begun and the thought that it _had_
begun, or, in Glosa, does this distinction not matter?  EG

  U komiti pa komence id unio. [The committee has begun its meeting.]

  U komiti pra komence id unio, kron M. Peters pa arive te voka an kredi;
un unio pa es no-konstitu.
  [The committee had begun its meeting, when Mr Peters arrived to announce
his belief: the meeting was unconstituional.]

   Old Glosa again?  What is the New Glosa for "had", or is there none?

Saluta,
 Robin G.

*   I thought that Glosa did cover these, though Paul Bartlett has
mentioned his perception of a lack of 'Perfective' particle.

 . Perfective: PRA [had] ... unfortunately this is now Old Glosa, but it
  seemed to work very well.

 . Passive: GENE GE-verb [got VERBed]  ... perhaps a bit unwieldy, but one
gets used to it.  Note that originally Glosa had no Passive Voice.

*   Thank you for telling us what the 'world standard' is.  I have seen the

    One question is whether the Glosa group, if it were to insist on a
YYYY.MM.DD date format, would be in the vanguard of cultural development,
or would be seen to be pushing an, as yet unaccepted, "Standard".

*   If it is "official", and will be in place for the majority of the
coming millenium, then it should be Glosa!
    But, for the 'hard of hearing' I do prefer the "(YY)YY" option: so I
see 2001.01.03 - or 03.01.2001 - as being much more useful in the first
decade of the new period than either 01.01.03 or 03.01.01.


 Other than that, terms MO

  01/01/03

  3 Meno-Mo 2001
  3 Mo 01
  3Mo2001
  2001-Mo-03
  2001-01-03 ............. This one feels like a clear date that is in line
with the International Standard.

   If that day was a Thursday, it could,depending on the context, be:-
    Di-Penta, 2001 Mo 3
    Di5, 2001 Mo 03
    Penta, 2001-01-03
    5, 01-01-03
 or 5, 010103  -----------  using all numerals, and the S.I. sequence in a
                             six-digit block.

   I would, however, psychologically feel happier with the Old Fashioned ...
    Di-Penta, 3 Mo 01 , which is on a rising plane of duration size .

   N.B. All of the above comments relate only to the WRITTEN form of the date.

   What, if anything, does the I.S.O. say about the way we SAY the date -
on the telephone, on radio, on T.V., or simply in conversation?

*   I can follow the chronometer "time" idea trailing off, like long decimals, into digits of insignificance.  But the ancient timekeeping system of "Suns", "Moons" and "Nights" long preceded our decimalisation of time, and might continue for many suns, to come.

    Only computerised equipment ^worries^ about clock-times with xx:xx:xx accuracy; most humans are happy if the get the hour right, let alone the minute, as in "I sent the letter Yesterday".

    Such a point in time, as the one you sign off with, might be conventionalised one day to:  990131:100000 .  Happily I won't be around then.

    I do not suggest that we specify a moment .. starting with its decimalised part of a second, either, EG 000010:310199 .  But I do wonder if the I.S.O. building has been taken over by robots (or computers).


    My guess is that 90% of humanity still counts time by the "Nights/Moons/Suns" system.  I believe that Glosa is for these people, too.

    My feeling, however, is that when specificity fails, descriptiveness
should take over.  How do they compare:-
  Bi-tri miliona mero de un Amp.  ...........  23/1000000 A
  Punkta ze-ze-ze-ze-bi-tri de un Amp.  .....  0.000023 A
  Bi-tri su mo miliona de un Amp.  ..........  23/1000000 A
  Bi-tri para dek ad u dina de minus six.  ..  23 . 10^-6 A
  U bi-tri miliona mero de un Amp.  .........  23 . 1/1000000 A
  Bi-tri mikroAmp.  .........................  23 mikroA

    My dictionary carries all of the prexfixes, symbols and values for
Metric prefixes, from 10^18 to 10^-18, if anyone would like them.

There are only two Tense particles: PA [past], FU [future] - (no present).

There are six Aspect particles: PROTO [start], SIO [condional], DU

and RE- or ITERA [repetitive].

***************************
    Once, in Old Glosa, there was PARATO [already], which is straight from
the Latin.  Through contraction (removal of A-TO), the aforementioned PRA
[had] can be derived from this. EG

  Un unio pa parato komence. [The meeting had already begun.]
   ..... did already begin

  Un unio pra komence.  [The meeting had begun.]

Which is best?  Is ~pra~ an allowable contraction of the Past particle and
Perfective particle into one form, or, for standardisation, would it be
better to resurrect ~parato~ and leave ~pra~ in the O.G. file?  Note that
the two different Glosa sentences above, have the same English-language
meaning.
   Somehow, I suspect that Glosa works, and does so differently from other
languages ... possibly innovatively, and better!  Should the O.G. ~parato~
be revived to become the Perfective Element that we are seeking?
 ##############################
For similar reasons, on the "Repetitive" front, I feel that the separate
particle ITERA [again] is better than the prefix RE- [repeated] which would
add an inconsistency to the pattern.

Some say that Esperanto is sexist because it uses -in- to make a feminine
noun from the masculine/epicene root. I say that *if* it is sexist, it is
so for a quite different reason: men must share the root with women in the
epicene and have no infix to call their own. Why should women enjoy such
preferential treatment?

Yes, that was slightly tongue in cheek.

But why did this come to mind? Well, the situation seems similar to me.
By omitting "mile", do we offend backwards (Shhh. I'm a US citizen, so I
can say that.) countries like the United States? Or would inclusion of
"mile" instead be preferential treatment for the US and such? I think the
latter.

The alternative would require, in fairness, unique words for units of all
systems. Maybe the omission of "mile" in the International Language will
help to drag the US, kicking and screaming, into the 18th century.

Cool! I've been using YYYY.MM.DD for at least a couple of decades now, and
I recently came across that ISO standard on the Web, the only difference
being that they suggest '-' rather than '.'. Looks like they have finally

    Robin, sorry for the seemingly harsh words, but do you understand
the difference between tense and aspect?  You are still asking your
question of "has begun" and "had begun" in terms of the English verb
system, which blends and/or confuses tense and aspect.  "Has begun,"
despite being called (rather mistakenly) a "(present) perfect tense,"
has more of a tense which is both past and present because the aspect
is more or less imperfective (despite the name), inasmuch as the action
can be considered ongoing (it began and is still going on).  "Had
begun" is a past tense with something of a perfective aspect, inasmuch
as with respect to the time reference, the action is no longer
characterized as continuing.  The English verb system is a real mess,
and I think you are letting your native-speaker habits lead you astray.
I have heard adult learners of English as a second language struggle
with the monstrosity of English verbs.

    Conditional is a mood, neither an aspect nor a tense.  Again, our
abominable English verb system (and some of the school teaching that
goes with it) is leading people astray.

    If other verb particles are short, 'parato' would seem to be a bit
long to me.

    In my opinion, no.  Tense and aspect should be marked separately if
they are marked at all.  Why blend only a single combination of tense
and aspect into one particle?  There is no more justification for this
than for inventing hybrid particles for every possible combination of
tense, aspect, mood, and voice.  (Maybe Glosa verbs should have three
voices, as in classical Greek, complete with medial and passive
deponents.)

    Not everyone is yet so optimistic about the present state of the
Glosa verb system, which seems too much to mimic the absurdities of
English.  We really do need Glosa to be worked over by a native speaker
of a non-Indo-European language WHO DOES NOT KNOW ENGLISH.  I fear that
English habits are leading native speakers astray.

Paul,
   Thank you for being so firm about tense and aspect.  Glosa does
indeed have the serious deficit of being supported mainly by English
speakers, especially ones who cannot step outside of it and see the
horrid mess that the English tense system has become in the last several
centuries. I truly wish we had a non-English speaking Russian involved in
it, or a Chinese who would brush the whole thing (pardon the pun) under
the rug!

    I still lean in favour of the language, and suspect that the book is
using an impefect system of analysis.
    But, yes, Glosa should have rules of usage to ensure that the timing of
the action(s) is teased out a bit, and not all in a clump.

    Things would have been easier if the phantom RECENTO [recent(ly)],
that I even remember using, was in the dictionary where I thought it was.
_Glosa 6000_ gives "recently" NU PA.   Perhaps it would be best to locate
such 'adverbs' at the start of the sentence, when they modify a 'verb' with
mixed tense.  EG
         Nu pa, mi pa du ki ad eduka-do.
 glos: recent past, I did continue to go to (the) learning building
      [Recently, I have been going to school.]

Or, to add the extra information that I am still continuing to attend
school, it needs to be spelled out, as Paul does, below.  Otherwise, the
first sentence leaves us in some doubt.  EG
         Nu pa, mi pa du ki ad eduka-do, e mi du ki.
        [Recently, I have been going to school, and am still going.

*   Agreed,
      This is the reason for the Glosa team's working at the applied level
in Third World countries, as well as on the EC reference their translation
costs.
      People in the English-speaking world percieve no serious problem, and
have no 'leverage' to persue global communication at a level higher that
that of English.  But Asia and Africa do have very serious language
problems now; and, effort put into demonstrating Glosa's effectiveness in
these areas will be greatly rewarded.  Hence my .. as yet unsuccessful ..
attempt to find - through the Net - other Affluents who will correspond, in
Glosa, with Third Worlders.

     However, to write to people in Africa or Asia, we need to be using a
stable language: this explains the reason for trying to remove
inconsistencies from the Glosa dictionaries, and for tying to find a
practical way of demonstrating the fundamentals of Glosa grammar.  It also
explains why Paul Bartlett and I are loathe to suggest adding neologisms to
Glosa.

     But "Apologism" for the IAL hypothesis has a very long history, and
although I would like to add my title, "Glosa: A Model for the
International Auxiliary Language", to the list, I am having trouble just
keeping up with e-mail and correspondence with Third Worlders.

     Again, I would urge subscribers to the Glosalist to develop their
skills, of writing Glosa, to the level where they can join the pidgeon post
correspondence network.

    And I still appreciate the "get" used to make the original passive form.

*   Think I've got it: rather than the absence of a particle implying an
opposite, it would be better if the absence just meant that the particular
Tense or Aspect is not intended.  (Does IIUC mean the assumption of the
opposite situation to the one omitted?)
   Example - even in English - do make thing easier for me to follow.

>If nothing better turns up, "pra" is fine wiht me.
*   Recently, I looked hard and found both PRAE and PARATO: though I prefer
the feel of PARATO, it does not satisfy your desire for a one-sylable CV
particle.  Paul doesn't like PRA because it was originally a one-word blend
of Past Tense and Perfective Aspect.
    If it was relegated to Perfective Aspect only, this would give the Past
Perfect as PA PRA, and this feels wrong to me, while PA PARATO rolls off
the tongue satisfyingly.

    Where would we find CV syllables that are derivationally sound and not
already in the lexicon?  Also, if we attempted to abbreviate the last
three, we would lose their etymological basis.
    I actually prefer these longer forms, which sound good on their own, or
with PA or FU; alternatively, if we relegated PRA from being a combined
Tense-Aspect particle [=had] to simply being an Aspect particle
[=previously], then the Past Perfect form would be PA PRA [did previously],
which would sound more like a stutter than two distinct words.

*   Paul does sum up the compromise situation beween form and derivation.

    The triangle of linguistic elements working inside Glosa, as I see it,
is:-
  % Greco-Latin lexical source-words,
  % Pronunciation of these words, close to current usage of derivatives,
  % Spelling that captures both Classical source and present phonetic
pronunciation.

  The best example I can give is ~skience~
 = It looks like the modern English word "science".
 = And is close to the Latin source-word ^scientia^.
 = The Latin ^sciens^ [knowing] was probably pronounced with a hard "C",
and had the "I" and the "E" marked for separate pronunciation.

  This comes down to a pronunciation: skEE'AYn-CHAY

*   We seem to have two main problems in Glosa inherited with the "that"s
from English: there is the form of the word that we use to translate at
least four different usages of "that"; and there is the question of a vocal
inflection that varies with the different "that" functions.
    While I believe that vocal inflection follows clearcut psychological
rules, and that second generation users of an IAL, like Glosa, will develop
the associated inflections, that go with the language, I acknowlege that we
can't rely on the first generation adult learners being taught vocal
inflection.

etymological claim to serve as a clause marker for one of these?
   As it stands, there is only one Glosa equivalent of "that" with double
function: KE.  If a suitable alternative cannot be found for one of these
usages, rather than introduce another odd word, I would feel that such
duplication is bearable.

This is somewhat true. But still, whenever there is a necessity to
coin a new word or even a new grammatical structure, as would happen
if a perfective aspect were added, as it *should* be, then (now) is
a good time to TRY to follow "idealistic meta-principles" such as

1. CV for particles and affixes
2. CVCV or CVCVCV for substantives

Or, as nearly as possible. While I'm at it, ...

3. minimal number of verbs/verboids/auxiliaries
4. topicalized dictionary (grouped semantic fields).

For all peoples universally, CV syllables are easiest.
To maximally distinguish grammatical from content words,
the only method available in modern Glosa is length.

Assuming the language catches on to the extent of having
a speaking community, all rules go out the window anyway.
And it's too late to recast Glosa's existing deviant words.

So once again, I'm recommending aspiration to better principles
whenever possible, but be practical about when to make-do with
what is. Perfection is unattainable, but the opposite is avoidable.

The Graeco-Latin pattern is not untouchable; current Glosa is
far enough from recognizability that a *little* more mangling
wouldn't hurt. In fact, the Frater project, which I regard as
a close, uh, relation to Glosa, has gone much further in that
direction, with no ill effects, i.e. it looks OK and would work.

THAT item #3 just needs a colon excision.

Item #4 is an idiom THAT needs to be banned from usage.
Re-phrase as "then" or "causing".

Commas are very simply and universally *pauses*, and should not
be futzed with. Hogben introduced the weird semicolon and colon,
THAT (qi?) are so ridiculous and unworkable.

    Oh?  Do monoglot speakers of widely divergent languages and
cultures uniformly use vocal inflections the same way?  I do not have
hard data, but I am very, very, very, very skeptical, to say the least.
I am of the opinion that at least in the beginning, a conIAL should
bend over backwards in -not- depending on vocal inflections to convey
-anything-.

    Once again, how do you speak a comma or semicolon?  If you say they
represent some sort of pauses or vocal inflections, then we are back to
the same problem.  At least Lojban has "verbal punctuation" and
attitudinals so that it can be -spoken- in a uniform monotone and still
convey what needs to be said.

    I do not appreciate it at all.  "Get" has so many and such
nefarious uses that I recommend that it be omitted from all further
discussions of the Glosa verb system.  It does not even seem to be used
consistently among various dialects of English (for instance, I do not
seem to use it as Robin does), so how can we even use it to discuss?

    What "rolls off the tongue satisfyingly" is such an individual

    SIO marks a mood, not an aspect, and I thought the discussion was
around only two aspects, not six.

    This is something of the bugaboo with Glosa purporting to have
Greco-Latin roots.

    "Previously" would mark a tense, not an aspect.  Really, we do need
to get this tense/aspect/mood matter straight if we are to be taken
seriously and if Glosa is to be used by non-Indo-European peoples (or
even just non-English-speaking peoples).

> *   It looks as if the Glosa "Tense Table" will need some slight

    I recommend that the phrase/name "Tense Table" be scrapped
entirely.  Refer to it as a "verb table."  Again, confusion arises from
the English verb system and the way it may often be taught to children
(even in the otherwise very good grammar-school education I had in the
midwestern US in the 1950s).

    I think it's a little bit of both.  Because the English verb system

    There is a problem with this scheme parsing word boundaries in a
speech stream.  One could go into details on it, and it is part of the
problem that the Lojban designers faced, even at the expense of CV
alternation.

> Or, as nearly as possible. While I'm at it, ...

    Actually, I foresee a need for so few additional grammatical
function words that I really doubt that the "idealistic
meta-principles" would make much difference in the case of Glosa.

> 3. minimal number of verbs/verboids/auxiliaries

    My opinion is that the current complement is not excessive.
However, I think that the term "verboid" should be dropped as
essentially meaningless, even if Hogben did use it and A&C copied
his usage.

    This is merely a lexicographical matter that could be addressed
with different available word lists.

    Unfortunately, I think that Glosa has done quite a bit of mangling..
I have at least some familiarity with Greco-Latin roots and English
etymology, and I have had trouble with some of Glosa's mangled words.
I am tending to think that Hogben may have had it better within the
assumptions he was working with.

    Are you referring to the original Lingua Sistemfrater of the 1950s?
Actually, it had quite a few consonant clusters and closed syllables,
possibly too many for your taste.  If I had more or less completed
vocabulary for my frater2, my original intention had been to stick
somewhat to the Greco-Latin design of both Interglossa and Frater,
neither of which would meet the CV/CVV/VCV/CVCV criterion.

    As I have mulled it over, I probably would not complete frater2
as it stands.  If I were to do further work, I would probably blend
frater2's grammar with something like Suma's word and vocabulary
structure and scrap so-called recognizabilty (which would make things
more allegdly "neutral" anyway).  Recently I used a program I wrote to
generate words.  However, I have not yet given a lot of consideration
to the word boundary (speech stream parsing) problem that can arise
with certain fixed syllable structures.

    I may being doing less in the auxlang world in coming times.  For
the last six years I have not worked due to ill health, but I may soon
be going back to work, in which case I will have less time for other
pursuits.

*   Not too sure if the "new learners" would all be ecstatic, especially if
they were aware of the original vocabulary from which the *regularised*
lexicon had been extracted.  It sounds more like CyberGlosa than a version
of Glosa, but could catch the popular imagination more than the
linguistically rational, Glosa, has.

    However, being much more suitable for machine handling, such a
CyberGlosa would get a lot further a lot quicker, as a "Meta-language" for
man-machine interfaces using limited lexicons, than has the 'humanistic'
Glosa.

    I will agree that such a parsable ^Nu-type^ language could be what the
world has been waiting for, but I ask about the feasibility of such a
project and the 'lead-time' it would need.  I wonder when the world will be
ready to make use of such a readily machine-handleable communication medium.
    In very practical terms, Clark is over 80, and I top 60; so,
considering that I have got this far with Glosa in twenty years, and that
Clark and Ashby are unlikely to give such a project either time, or their
blessing, how many more years of my life would be needed, if I was to help
CyberGlosa get off the ground?  And considerably more importantly, how many
genuine ACTIVISTS would you need to muster, to gain a critical mass of
developers?

    I imagine that such a project would need its own Mailing List, and
would attract its own coterie of enthusiasts .. who would have different
psychological leanings from the, more 'humanist', Glosa supporters.
Meanwhile,
after clearing the screen of Glosalist postings needing "Reply"s, I move to
the writing desk to answer a letter, in Glosa, from Leonard Sekibaha, in
Tanzania: Leonard is a representative of the vast majority of mankind .. in
the Third World.

    Charles, please post the proposal for a regularised, specifically
machine-handleable derivative of Glosa on this List.
 a. Would you be able to run (moderate) a special Mailing List for it?
 b. Do we know of a suitable Net ISP that would host such a site?
 c. What size of regularised lexicon (which I will subsequently call the
"e-Lex") would such a start-up require to allow functional research?
 d. What would be the guidelines for abstracting an e-Lex from the Clasical
Glosa roots?
 e. How much time would be budgetted for this process, and how much for the
subsequent 'parser' testing of the e-Lex?
 f. Would commercial safeguards be needed, such as copyright and the
payment of royalties - hopefully 0.5% to Richmond, UK - as well as
sponsorship arrangements?
 g. What sort of response, of genuine activists, would you expect from the
Net for such a project: it would possibly need a Net News location and
Website as well as a Mailing List address?

    So far there are two supporters: you and me.  I would definitely have
to make room for the Toshiba luggable at work, if I was to Glosa and
CyberGlosa, as well.  But I could not take a leading role in it: my prime
committment is still to Glosa.

Saluta,
 Robin G.
   P.S. My original proposal for specialist lexicons is still firmly rooted
in the idea of 'humanist', hand-written and spoken language .. but with

Basically the AdjC is inserted in the middle of the Prime Clause:
 The woman (who is going around the corner) is my neighbour.
=The woman, who is going around the corner, is my neighbour.
~U gina; qi du ki peri u gona, es mi para-pe.

>The woman; who is going round the       U gina; qi ki peri gono; es

IE
 The woman, who is going round the       U gina; qi du ki peri u gona,
   corner, is my neighbour.                es mi para-fe.

*   I guess (that) you are 'forcing' a "that" here with the ~ke~.
    Also you are attempting to avoid the ^nesting^ of of the AdjC, but it
is still there in the middle of the sentence, after all; and you are making
the second part of the Prime Clause look like a separate mini-sentence, by
invoking the Personal Pronoun, ~fe~, rather than use the Relative Pronoun,
~qi~.  It does sound more pidgin-like, but does not split the main sentence
into two separate mini-sentences.  Possibly ...

 ~U-la gina ki peri u gona; fe es mi para-fe.~
[That woman goes round the corner; she is my neighbour.]

 ... maintains a "that", but one of a ^different colour^, while giving the
full 'pidgin' flavour of two mini-sentences.

   I reckon the *creole* generation of (Glosa) IAL-speakers would
automatically come up with the ^nested^ structure using the Relative Pronoun.

It should *not* be a huge undertaking though, just an addition to
what is already in Paul's glosaref web page (which he got the idea of
from someone previous). At the SIL site there is a set of
"field study" notes that describes something like this for natlangs:

I think all that is needed is some very *minimal* tweaking,
nothing major as you appear to be thinking here. A consistent use
of existing particles would make machine parsing much easier,
and perhaps a *very few* added particles like "perfective"
would help humans more than machines. Also, the current
dictionary project will be a great help to all.

> Charles, please post the proposal for a regularised, specifically

If I was to get off my butt, I'd write a Glosa chatterbot.
There are several implementation options which need not be exclusive:
1. Pure CGI/Perl on a web page with a type-in form interface
2. Java applet that can run disconnected from the net
3. Standalone Perl program for some software platforms

What would it do? Be a conversational Glosa translator of sorts.
It would have the 2.5k Glosa net dictionary embedded in it,
and ask the user to clarify whatever it could not parse.
And maybe after editing it, optionally upload the message to a
web-page bulletin-board, or just read messages others have left.

That's a somewhat do-able idea, open-ended enough to add some
fun features to maintain interest. Hmm, such an idea must have
been tried before. ???

I see computers as ultimately a counterforce to corporate fascism,

When I approached my ISP, Zeta Internet, about the problem of e-mail

Hello Friends,
  This is Friday 26th Feb, and I resend the GLOSLITE.NET file again, but
this time in six bits .. estimated to be around 20K each .. hoping they are
below the maximum length for emails accepted by Brown University.
 ----------------------------------Ko mi plu digita ge-kruci, Robin------

Friends,  (From original "Bounced" message of two weeks ago.)
   Here, at last, is the working model of the "Glosa Net Dictionary",
which, as a 'work in progress' I have called the GLOSLITE.NET file.
 (1) It is in two columns: only the left column is included in the count,
which, by a pure fluke, was almost exactly <2500>; the words in the right
column are the near misses, or words that might perhaps have been included
in a starter vocabulary, but, for reasons of parsimony, weren't.
 (2) No serious adding of "Omitted" words has occurred; nor have I slowed
down long enough to check out the sorting which has occurred between
similar words and meanings on the Glosalist - apart from what my memory
retained.
 (3) Because this is not yet a refined list, I have not spent time
nit-pickingly removed of the informational ",G."s telling that the words
are of Greek origin.
 (4) Likewise, the white-space within the two parts of a definition have
not been filled (EG.  OPUS a work  -->  OPUS a_work).
 (5) When .. and if .. I get the nod from participants on this list, that
the GLOSLITE.NET file is a suitable 'median' position to work from, in the
formation of a _Glosa Net Dictionary_, aka "GLOSA 2.5K", then I will get on
with the topping and tailing operations: removing  ,G.s  and
putting in the necessary '_' white-space fillers.
 (6) Using the reasonably poweful Macro scripting of Galaxy word processor,
I can "reverse" the lists and generally strip unwanted columns: making each
side of the entries a single string
   EG,  XXXXX_XX_XXXX xx_xxx,xxx(xxx_xx)
 allows better handling of the entries than if spaces are left in them;
I do not know if such form standardisations are helpful to people using
different text-handling methods.  Please send feedback.
 (7) The words on the right hand side can be omitted to keep "GLOSA 2.5K"
within bounds, and Net-pliant.  Please let me know if this GLOSLITE file is
too long for your email program to handle: if members of the Glosalist find
the file does not come through, I will strip the R.H.S. column and resend
as a shorter Attachment, to see if such a reduction makes any significant
difference.

   After this, maybe I can get back to the normal answering of email.

Hurrying to work.

Saluta,
 Robin

&   Thank you for the thoughtful reply.  Part of the problem comes from the authors' amateurism in marketting methods.  Had they tested the water on the statement: GLOSA HAS NO GRAMMAR, they would never have tried this oversimplification of the truth.  They are still using the statement, even though I have asked for it to be removed.

&   I will agree that terminology is a real B*** in linguistics.  I have not heard the terms 'Predicate' and 'Co-ordinator' used in these ways before.  To the average man in the street, and even the average Auxiliary Language enthusiast, I feel that something as painfully simple as 'big' words and 'little' words would be even more meaningful.

    So, I should look up the two words that have used (only because I have heard them used in this way before) to see where I went wrong; and, if possible, I should find suitable "linguistically neutral" terms to describe these two categories, then give my definitions of these new terms.


>>In Glosa a word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.

&   The problem arises when Clark and Ashby repeat the Hogben original, that the language is a concept-language, like Chinese, and that each word is thus a concept centre.  People take violent exception to Chinese being described as a 'concept language'.  However, I am glad that you take no exception to this word-representing-a-concept idea.

&   I have not heard the term "right branching" before, but can guess what it means.  Originally I had though that "Head Final" structure covered the situation, well enough; but then, Mike Farris told me, briefly, what that term meant, and it did not fit either.

    So, we might have to rewrite the grammar book, and come up with all of our own terms to describe Glosa, simply because it does not fit the existing definitions, even though it is (more or less) fully consistent within itself.

    On schools and girls, I imagine that Glosa learners will be taught, at the start, to break up the phrase into two, using prepositions:-

   ~u beli pusi sko-do pro plu ju-fe~  OR

   ~u sko-do de u beli pusi ju-fe~

&   At present the compound is either hyphenated or left as two words: I prefer the use of the hyphen, especially where, as in this example, the two parts of the compound have almost the same semantic weighting.  Though, in a more humanitarian, and less functional way, I believe the 'feminine' element to have the greater value.   By using the hyphen, then, the compound is readily recognised as the 'Head' of the phrase.  From your Esperanto, I judge that only the *lavovirino* contains concatenisation.  And the answer is NO: the words, in Glosa, are supposed to maintain their identity (even for computer recognition, and I guess we can teach the computer the significance of a hyphen); also, the -ino type of "diminutive" does not feature in Glosa, apart from the direct negative where ~no-getili~

is "unkind", but ~andra~ is "man", and ~gina~ is "woman.

    BTW, ~sagaci paleo lava-fe~ covers "wise old washer-woman" in Glosa.

&   You are right.  It is my belief that Hogben was intuitively discovering "Functional Grammar" before Halliday came on the scene.  As such, he tried to name the functions of the words, and used terms which have been replace with others, as the science of linguistics matured.

    I looked into the Cobuild English Grammar, and found:-

  be, have, do as "auxiliaries"  AND

  can, could, may, might, must, ought, shall should, will as "modal verbs" or "modal auxiliaries"


    So, yes the Interglossa/Glosa terminology is archaic, and we ought to decide on wheter to go with the current usage within Functional Grammar, or to hoe our own row, and use "verboids" but define them specifically.

    On the auxiliaries, ES, HABE, and AKTI are used in Glosa much as the English-language equivalents are used, and so warrant the modern terminology, 'auxiliaries'.

    And, while the generic word, 'particles' does cover the small words following 'verbs' in Glosa, as well as in English, I would like to find a distinctive term for these particular particle, to separate them from Glosa's other particles, because these have a more syntactic significance, while the verb particles are more semantic in function.

   Guess I should expand the list to four types of verbs with:

"Substantives" (or a more suitable modern term) e.g. RIDI [laugh],

 Auxiliaries    e.g. HABE [have]

 Modals (or Verboids)   e.g. POTE [can]

 Phrasals       e.g. KI ANA [go up]


   But we definitely do not want to scare people off Glosa by 'over grammaticising' it.

   While "Predicate" is the description you would use for verbs that can stand alone, is there another possible descriptive term that you can think of, for the words that function as 'full verbs' .. while noting that in other sentences, the exact same words could function as nouns or modifiers.

    Still, adding it all up, Hogben went too far into the intricacies of Grammar in "Interlingua", but Clark and Ashby over-reacted by going too far in the opposite direction, trying to avoid giving anygrammar guidelines, which might have been potentially confusing.  Although I feel Hogben's error was the greater, I now wish to find the ^golden mean^ by giving just enough grammatical information to allow learners to use Glosa wisely, while not confusing them.  I would

>>     e.g.   An         pote     ki    ana         u monta.

>>glos.       he         can      go     up         the mountain

>>                    [He can ascend the mountain.]

might not represent the best analysis to be applied to Glosa.

There is no more justification for this

*Haitao in China was the best case of this, but he is an Esperantist, and
did not like Glosa's lack of P-o-S markers and verb inflections.
    So, I am left with intuition as my next best indicator of Universal

    It is safe to go ISO, and part of Bill's way of doing things.  However,
if we allow a range of usages for such things, then, as long as the methods
are self-consistent and unambiguous, then they will make sense, and be
understood.
    I am a bit of an open-planner, and would think that in Glosa we should
avoid the conformism that feels like cultism .. in favour of an
ecumenachism that states we have thought of the problems, and suggest a
range of possible method which are acceptible  - mainly because they allow
unequivocal communication.  If I use a date format of either 27.02.1999 or
1999.02.27 no-one can possibly misunderstand it.

    I have sent my suggestions of the tense and aspect particles in Glosa to the list.  Now its your turn: maybe you have already done so, and I have not caught up with it yet.

    As Paul says, there's tense, aspect, mood and passivity too.

    Perhaps, Paul, if you make a list, using the English language, of the categories of particles, itemising same, that would be in your ideal language, then we will all know what we could be aiming at.


    While algebraically, it would be nice to keep each category of

pre-verb function separate, I imagine that the human mind might not be so neat.  This accounts for contractions, that are combinations of elements from the different categories, popularly used in English.  They might not be neat, but they are warm and cosy, and strangely human:-

  don't  [do not]

  has  [have is]

  had  [have did]

  can't  [can not]

  wasn't  [not did be]

  hadn't  [did not have]  ... are there places where "hadn't" is right,

                and "did not have" is wrong?

               EG  "If I hadn't done it, I'd be dead by now."

  was  [were is]

  seeded  [did seed]

  walking  [walk go] {? continuous}


    I suspect that a Glosa with fully separated particles will look and sound stilted, even though it may be computationally perfect.


    Then there is the odd question about finding suitable separate particles that fit in with Glosa's derivational system: do the sought for particles exist as separate elements in the Classical languages, or can we derive suitable particles from other languages, as I understand Glosa's GE- affix to have been, coming from German?

Similarly, I attemped to do a tricky thing to-day in writing about time which was of a different timescale from usual, and about people who were't actually people ... and all in Glosa, see "Re* Experiment".

    So to-day I used ~parato~ [already, before] twice: once successfully, the other time not so.  And on one occasion I was itching to replace the ~pa parato~ with ~pra~ because it felt a hundred times better and much more meaningful.  But I thought about our discussions, and I stuck to your guns: still I am not convinced ... in the real world of pragmatism and psychology ... that a combined tense/aspect particle is WRONG.


   I would like to see others on the list attempting more Glosa prose.

   It is my belief tha we need to get the right blend of theory and practice with Glosa, but we can only get that when there is more preactice.


Saluta,

 Robin

    I have stated my opinion that all the Glosa verb system really
needs at present is a perfective marker and some uniform way of forming
a passive.  With respect to the latter, I object so much to bringing
'get/got' into the discussion for the simple reason that "get" and
"got" are not even used the same way throughout the English speaking
world!  Robin, speaking Brito-Oz English, uses them differently from
the way we Yankees use them -- or don't use them, frequently.  So using
'get/got' to describe a verb construction just muddies up the water
because of inconsistent usage even among native anglophones.  As for a
perfective marker, I have not yet seen a good candidate and have not
come up with one of my own.

>     As Paul says, there's tense, aspect, mood and passivity too.

    I presume that "passivity" refers to voice, and for the record,
active and passive are not the only voices known.  Classical Greek had
a middle voice.

    By "using the English language" do you mean "providing examples
from English verb forms?  If that in fact is what you mean, I will not
do so, precisely because the English verb system is such a mess that
trying to draw examples from it will shed more obscurity that light.
Really, verbal modalities are so basic that they should not even need
examples for conIAL constructors.  However, my short list is
approximately like so:

Tense: past, present, future; the present could possibly be the
       unmarked form, although this is negotiable in ambiguous cases.

Aspect: imperfective, perfective; the ummarked form is simply unmarked
        for aspect.

Mood: this remains not entirely well worked out, although some
      languages (such as English) often mark mood primarily with
      auxiliaries; the existing Glosa auxiliaries appear to be
      adequate; however, do imperative/jussive and/or optative
      need to be set out better?

Voice: active for the unmarked form; passive needs to be regularized:
      I favor the 'es ge-X' form of G.E.O.; I do NOT like the 'gene
      ge-X' form, considering it rather ugly, redundant, and an
      unnecessary aping of some -- not all! -- dialects of English;
      medial/reflexive voice can be taken care of by pronominal
      constructions, although the appropriate uses of 'se' and 'auto'
      are ambiguous and not well defined.

    Rubbish.  Any particular set of contractions tends to depend on the
particular characteristics of the language in which they occur.  They
seem "warm and cosy, and strangely human" -only- to native speakers.
To non-native speakers, they may simply be baffling.  I never have
figured out the rationale for some French contractions.  They probably
have none, just as English contractions have no rationale other than a
tendency within English phonemics to reduce vowels.  English, as a
structurally Germanic language, does not shy away from consonant
clusters clusters and vowel reductions.  There is nothing particularly
"warm and cosy" about them at all.  I think you are once again being
led astray by your native language habits.

    My opinion is to the contrary.

    No, because Greek and Latin were/are highly inflected languages, so
there were numerous inflected forms doing the work of particles in an
highly isolating language like Glosa.

    I thought that 'ge-' was contracted from 'gene', itself of Greek
origin.

    I am not saying that blending tense and aspect in one construction
is somehow -wrong-.  After all, the horrendous English verb system does
work after a fashion.  I am only saying two things: 1) In a planned
auxiliary language, I see no good reason for not keeping tense and
aspect separate, as is so in some languages and would be easier to
teach (at least to non-Anglophones; many native anglophones are already
warped by their native habits); 2) I see no valid justification for
having a sole particle blending just one specific pair of tense and
aspect in place of a welter of particles combining every conceivable
combination of tense, aspect, mood, and voice.  Why not just have
several dozen such particles and be done with it?

    You are forgetting a fourth dimension: voice.

    I am not convinced one way or the other whether there even is such
a thing as "Universal Grammar."  But that is irrelevant.  Tense,
aspect, mood, and voice are simply empirically validated analytical
descriptors of the way verbs work.

    I am not aware that there is any better analysis of the way verbs
work.  What is the opposition to analytical categories which apply
across languages generally?  What makes Glosa so special and sui
generis?

    What does this even mean?  Languages are all over the map in
"parsimony and elegance," due to both linguistic characteristics and
social factors.  I have no reason to think that some sort of "mental
mechanism" is at work here.  Again and again, we -must- not be misled
into thinking that the comfortable habits of our native language
constitute some sort of mystical "language universals."

    I have addressed this in another post.  The issue is Glosa's verb
system, not English's.

    I tender my opinion that in such matters, intuition is an
unreliable guide, because people of varying backbrounds,
acculturations, and experiences may have vastly different "intuitions"
about the same things.
