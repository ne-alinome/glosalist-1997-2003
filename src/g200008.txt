As a teacher of foreign languages to English
speakers I can truly say that American (or other
wise native English speakers) can and do 
pronounce vowels well enough to be totally
and thoroughly comprehensible to native
speakers of languages that have clear sounding
final vowels. 

And also...

One of the reasons why Spanish is very
comprehensible to Portuguese speakers 
is the clarity of the vowels as opposed to
the other case where Portuguese is hard
for Speakers of Spanish who are not 
used to the long and short vowels of
Portuguese... eg. "casa" as "kah-zuh"
instead of "kah-sah" etc. To many Spanish
speakers the Brazilian variety is a lot more
comprehensible than the Portuguese 
mainland accent or the Azorean accent
one finds in the U.S. on the East Coast
quite often.

To use unstressed vowels in an IAL is
a big mistake in my opinion, since they
add nothing to the recognizability of words
and add a lot to their being hard to master.

Glosa is not Volapuk, and the umlauted
sort of sounds although easy for an Anglo
or German speaker are not so for others.

As to whether English is the most successful
auxiliary language... this is true, but on the
other hand it is also lots of fun to communicate
in something else. "Glosaists have more fun!"
Now if we could come up with a way to 
convince everyone of this we'd have an easy
time wouldn't we?

This is just plain silly. The majority of Spanish common nouns
are combinations of two syllables, having the accent on the
first syllable. This does not imply that the second syllable is
in anyway obscured or made into a schewa sound. Not at all!

Get a new clue on this one Carlitos, :-)))

~panto~ is "all" when there is a group of things being talked about [alle].
~Panto fito nece gene foto.~

~holo~ is "all" when there is one thing and you are talking about the whole
thing [ganz, all]. ~Mi vora (un) holo plaka.~

~singu~ is for when some things are distributed among a number of other
things [jede]. ~Singu manu habe penta digi~

~hekasto~ I guess, is a synonym for ~panto~


I agree that "any" and "some" should not be distinguished, so ~ali~ and
~uno~ can be synonyms

Perhaps, since there is so little time left, he should embrace a
more self-satisfied IAL, one that already has a following that is
just using the damn thing.  You are standing on the edge of the
abyss and the earth is crumbling under your feet, and the people
around you are remarking on the phenomenon, most in Esperanto,
some in Interlingua or Ido.  How important is it that Glosa has
the future potential to be better than any of them, if there will
be no future?

Mailing lists using IALs, unfortunately most in Esperanto, exist
already for such things as global pollution, the extinction of
species, and global economic conspiracies and strategies.

Or perhaps the imminent event is eschatological.

I was thinking about the GEO-leaflet "History behind Glosa", GEO, 
Richmond, 1996. 

Just a wish: 
It would be great if you would speak a Glosa text on a learner's 
cassette some day.  Then Robin could distribute it with his one. The 
existing cassette of Wendy Ashby and Ron Clark ("Introducing 
Euro-Glosa Cassette", GEO, Richmond 1990) has a strong, English 
accent, unacceptable for a learning material.  You as a Spanish 
teacher would be the best speaker we can get.

Funny, Charles, I played around with some statistics, too.  Perhaps 
I was inspired by your previous mails. 

I took out my old school book ("Grund- und Aufbauwortschatz Englisch", 
Klett Vl., Stuttgart 1977).  It goes back to "General Service List of 
English Words" by Michael West, 1953.  Charles, do you know this list? 
Who is "better", West or Kilgariff?  The book contains 
"Grund"-vocabulary 2000 words that should enable a text understanding 
of 85 % and "Aufbau", another 2500 words, should enable to 95 %.  The 
small list "roam ... royal" from "E5000 G1000" contains all of "Grund" 
(except "road" and "ring" (sound)) and most of "Aufbau".  So 
"English 5000 to Glosa 1000" can be estimated near to 90 %.  

Could it be, that ye ole, silly Glosa 1000, so much shouted at by us 
here in Glosalist, is not so bad? 

If so, or nearly so, we could: 
- Take Bill Patterson's dictionary 
    (www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/glosa.htm) and 
- put in "English 5000 to Glosa 1000". 
    (Unfortunately printing quality of the "Central Glosa" book is so 
    bad, that scanning and OCR-text recognition fails.) 
- Make again 3 levels: "Literary" with all words, "Base" without 
    synonyms, but this time prefer Glosa 1000 words (of course 
    without hidri/aqa, kron/tem, hipo/sub ...) and "Core" for 
    the most useful words, chosen with help of Kilgariff or similar.
Then:
- Create missing words, if needed. 
- Fix errors I mentioned 00-07-28.
- Contact Wendy. 
- Solve the bad synonym problem (karo/kara, silva/silvi ...) and other 
    ending vowel problems (krisi (crisis)/ kriso (golden)). 
- Refine the vocabulary by comparison with other Romanic languages, 
    other world languages and other IALs. 
- Discuss the results in Glosalist. 
- Translate the dictionary into French, German, Russian, Spain, ... 
- Test out the vocabulary by practical use: communication, 
    translations, writing literature. 

A long way.  But quickly a status can be reached that is better than 
the current.

The BNC. It is more recent, much larger and more systematic.
There is an honored tradition from Thordike to West and
the Longman's dictionary to the BNC. But, we can use *multiple*
resources, even other auxlang lists such as Ido/Novial/Occidental.

> Could it be, that ye ole, silly Glosa 1000, so much shouted at by us

I think the Glosa-1800 (by my count) is pretty bad,
and the Glosa-6000 not very much better.

Yes!

Yes yes yes.

The bad ones are bali/bale, different words with similar roots.
The ones like silva/silvi, same word spelled slightly different,
are a much easier thing to fix. Yes, we should fix them for the
new list, i.e. not include both bale/bali, and spell silva with -a.

> - Refine the vocabulary by comparison with other Romanic languages,

Yes, that will take some time of course.

> - Discuss the results in Glosalist.

Yes again.

With several or many people helping, it can all be accomplished.

Subject: [glosalist] final vowels
From: "John Schilke" <doc{at}clacknet{dot}com>

Greetings to all on the List!

I have been lurking and plan to continue to do so, since most of the summer
has been taken up with long-overdue travel.  Nonetheless, Ihave been
enjoying saving the recent discussions to re-read them.  In particular, I,
too, have been nonplussed by the problem of remembering the final vowels for
many words.

A suggestion, designed to stimulate comment rather than immediate
acceptance:  why not make the Glosa word really the "root" and leave the
final vowel to be chosen for euphony, personal preference, or even as a way
of demonstrating some attitude the speaker/writer may have towards the
utterance (truthfulness, value, agreement, emotion, etc.)?

Saluta ad panto-pe!

Well, this would be a radical change for
Glosa and it would be a different enough
language to signify a major revision or
a new language project, I would think.

Since,

My guess is that English-speakers will only pronounce
-i -a -o decently. And it won't hurt anything at all.
Pick the most plausible etymological vowel and schwa it.

But the Ido speakers might faithfully carry over their
-a for adjectives, -o for nouns, -e for adverbs. Beware,
they will try -i for plurals too! (I formerly urged the use
of part-of-speech marking for Glosa, but not anymore.)

It could be a lot of fun, actually, to watch it evolve.
Final vowels as fashion accessories?

That is the usual "unmarked" order, where the subject N
is the same as the agent/doer/causer role, and it matches
temporal cause-effect order as well, very useful.

Now, trying to imagine a conversation, ...
"An pa dona avi a qo-pe?" ... "A gina."
The examples in the reference seem to forbid these:
"A GINA an dona un avi." "A GINA un andro dona un avi."
Glosa doesn't invert word order for questions, either.

But not many languages forbid "fronting" for topicalization,
which is almost inevitable. One might try something like this
to emphasize the agent/doer: "PER ANDRO, gina pa gene un avi".

Ido uses "na" as a preposition for the direct object,
Otto Jesperson recommended "em" as an improvement.
With this there's much less need for clumsy passives,
and one annoying/superfluous article can be dropped;
"EM AVI un andro pa dona a gina."

So using PER/AD/EM seems to allow more flexibility and
expressiveness, at the usual cost of complexity. But maybe
removal or avoidance of passives makes it worthwhile?
The idea (originally Syd's, IIRC) seems attractive.

A popular idea in linguistic analysis called "optimality"
describes the tendency of language to balance certain goals
against others; the agent/doer tends to the front/left of the
sentence, competing in vain against a topicalized phrase,
which has higher precedence, but the agent out-competes
objects (unless they get topicalized).

Earlier-in-time is generally front/left-ward of later, so
most (95%) languages are SO rather than OS. Similar forces
lead to either prepositions and VO, or inflections and OV.
The only odd thing about Glosa is its adjective-noun order,
which tends (but not strongly) to go with OV languages.

Anyway, if fronting is to be allowed then we will need "em".

I don't know whether I'm saying anything new to most people here,
but I recently noticed the Radio Australia Tok Pisin service at
http://www.abc.net.au/ra/newsratp/.  A large resource.

Tok Pisin does seem to be a pidgin rather than a
language.  I.e. what you see is English with simplified grammar
assisted by a characteristic idiom that heavily depends on
"bilong" (belong) and "long" (alongside, I think, a legacy, as
Charles suggests, of contact with sailors).  And a simplified
phonetic spelling which largely emulates the pronunciations of
Australian English.

I'm still not persuaded that pidgins are a way forward for an
international language.  One problem is that an opportunistic
dialect cannot be systematic.  Perhaps it is not really true that
the grammar is simple, but rather that it snatches phrases from
the parent language, and the possible phrases in that language are
determined by a grammar which may be complex.

Regards,
Michael Talbot-Wilson

This is true; a random pidgin/creole needs much more
systemizing before it can serve as a global interlanguage.
Perhaps a better example would be Bahasa Indonesia,
which has served as a regional IAL, though still not
(perhaps) systematic enough for global use. But we should
learn what we can from these two examples; Glosa is
the only well-known IAL with a grammar of this type.

An isolating language *can* be as systematic as desired.
I think Glosa can be improved "merely" by reforming its
vocabulary, whereas other IALs are not so easily reformed,
judging by past history. I do believe that less grammar
is for the best, and there is hope for this approach.
>From what I have seen on other lists, other grammars

We need something much simpler for a real-world IAL.

But I'd like to hear more about what would constitute
"systematic", specifically. The Ido suffixes are not
so scientific as claimed, and certainly agglutination
is not going to win over the masses of the world.
I have several ideas on this, but nothing definitive.
The key is that vocabulary is flexible, grammar is stiff.

A somewhat daring claim, since "other grammars" are used
exclusively in their mailing lists (though admittedly, perhaps, by
the enthusiatic few), when that can't be said for Glosa.  Ido, you
say?  No-one writes in English to the Ido list.  If they did, they
would not be understood by several people who freely engage in
discussions there, especially the French and the Russians.

It's probably true of Ido, though, as of anything else, that many
people don't "fully" master it.  But people who have been learning
it for a day *say* things.

> But I'd like to hear more about what would constitute

Hmm...  Don't know how scientific they are claimed to be.  The
language strikes me as (as it were) a kind of compromise arrived
at by a very gifted committee.  I sense a kind of moderation, as
though principles, good in themselves, had not been pushed to
extremes.  It may well be that it is therefore unscientific.  
Perhaps it is artistic.

However, this is a Glosa list.  What I (instant expert) suggested
about Tok Pisin is that it is undefined, that it perpetually
shadows English.  (In part that is an unfair comparison.  English
is also undefined.  But it has been satisfactorily described, and
the description is autonomous.)

Being systematic, perhaps, means having an autonomous grammar.  
When talking about IALs, being systematic also means that the
grammar is well-defined, and perhaps completely defined.  Even if
it supposedly has no grammar, there is a predefined way, for
example, to signify number.  But that's not totally satisfactory.  
There is a prefined way (with "wanpela") to do that in Tok Pisin.

So don't press me too far on "systematic".  I mean something, or
it means something to me, but I'll leave it at that.

Regards,
Michael Talbot-Wilson

What I meant by Tok Pisin (and presumably pidgins in general)
being unsystematic was that, if it takes a phrase from the parent
language opportunistically, the phraseology is not derived from
any system within the language.  

For example, when the Australian media are blathering at length
about (Fiji) "coup leader George Speight", and then we see "ku
lida George Speight" on the Tok Pisin site, does the phrase "ku
lida" conform to the pattern of the language, and did its separate
words even exist in the language (the pidgin) prior to this story
making the news?  I don't claim to certainly know the answer, I'm
just using this example to trigger some guesses.

Could "ku lida" be generated within Tok Pisin, or could it only
arise because that expression became newsworthy in English?  In
the event that an independent Tok Pisin site had been first to
market with the news of the coup d'état, could the expression "ku
lida George Speight" have been used by it from the first?

I'm suggesting that if the language is imitative to a high degree,
the phrase does not arise in accordance with any system within it.

    It is possible to find that in both English and Glosa, the story
snowballs from the first word of the sentence to the last.  All along the
line, words in front modify the next, and so on.

    The Greek alphabet causes me to bog down every time: there is no direct
transliteration between the Roman alphabet and the Greek!

    I'm sure that a small number of 'rules of thumb' could be devised to
source the Greek dictionary for suitable roots to add to the Glosa lexicon,
but I would bet that there is no formula.

    What Ron Clark liked about the Greek lexicon was iits flexibility: the
words were redily compounded to form more complex concepts.

*   There is an answer to this question, and it is fairly simple: most of
us speak normal English, and if that was what we used on the Glosalist,
then we could have a majority of news and ideas in Glosa.
    But there IS a 'language about language' and this is what Linguists
speak.  And many on the Glosalist want to talk Linguistically about Glosa:
such discussions do not work in the everyday language of pedestrians.

*   Glosa was never meant to be a set piece, and, as a language of science,

    I do, however have a formula for deriving new words for the Glosa
lexicon.  I look u the Langensheidt _Shorter Latin Dictionary_ by feeding
in the English word into the back half, and get a range of likely-looking
Latin words.  From these I mentally shorten the words to suitable lengths
so that they look like Glosa words; then I check out my short-list of the
words in the front of the dictionary to see iif they hold the meaning and
suitable formin the Latin to English section.  When I have narrowed down my
selection, I look in Glosa 6000 to see that there is a linguistic space to
accommodate the new word, IE it doesn't look too close to an existing Glosa
word.  Then I write mu newly coined Glosa word into the "6000".
    Acase in point occurred when I sought the Glosa word for "employment" 
in "6000".  There was no entry covering it, and when I did my search in the
Latin Dictionary, the result, after rounding, was ~utor~.  This word was
close to ~uti~ for "use", but far enough away to be distinctive.

Joe, I used a gambling term here because I see the various auxlangs  (and
auxlang groups) as sitting around a gambling pit each throwing in their
bids, and each wishing the win the pot of gold that will come with IAL
Selection.

   Back to reality, when gambling on cards, often the stakes in the middle
of the table build up as no-one wins the hands.  This necessitates putting
the money into a container, possibly a "pot" to stop the coins from
spilling out into the playing area.  Hence the use of the term "jack-pot"
to cover the large amount of money that has been steadily building up,
waiting for a winner to "scoop the pot"

   It has long been my understanding that Country Australians enjoy using
colourful language and the telling of tall tales.  It is also a part of the
alure of Australia for me.  

   However, there could be a loss of enjoyment in the act of communication
if the adopted IAL has no scope for idiomatic and metaphorical usages. So,
as the result of a discussion a couple of years ago on the Conlang List, I
decided that we ought to be able to use colourful language in our
international communications, as long as we marked them as such, using a
symbol to denote the use of non-literal language.

   Shortening the story, I now might describe heavy rain, by saying, "It's
raining ^cats and dogs^."

   In the gamble for IAL status, perhaps Glosa will ^scoop the pot.^

  Robin

*   Yes, agreed, the use of prepositions in English suggest that I might
use the corresponding Glosa equivalent.  But this woild often be wrong,
English usage is often more learned than logical.     

    Ron Clark declared ~de~ to be the #multipurpose# preposition in Glosa.
So, when you were telling a story, requiring a preposition, butyou didn't
know which, then the odds were that it would be ~de~.  Wher I want to
indicate the 'infinitive, but don't feel that ~te~ is correct, I use ~de~.

    There can be little discussion within a language community over this

competition.  Having a choice of brand-names might improve efficiency in
the financial marketplace, but I cannot see the existence of competing
auxiliary languages improving efficiency in the market-place of ideas.
    And on the question of standardisation, I would use a different
analogy.  During my Secondary Schooling, the MKS system of Physical Units
was adopted: life was much more straightforward after this, by contrast
with the mixed systems of units that existed before-hand.

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

_A second Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1998_
-----------------------------______________________------- File: SEMINAR.#2

BASIC GRAMMAR RULES
                     There are three basic rules behind the grammar of
Glosa: combined, they tell us 'position determines function'.

        1. S-V-O: Subject, Verb, Object order in a clause.
        2. "A word is modified by its precedent."  One word modifies the
             next, and so on.
        3. A word can function, within reason, as any part of speech.
             There are no Part-of-Speech markers, but a word's function is
             indicated by its position in a sentence.
        __________________________________________________________________
        All other rules of Glosa usage follow from these.
All sentences contain a 'verb': it is the word that tells us the action
occurring in the sentence; it gives the sentence _life_.

VERBS
        In Glosa, the word in the middle of the sentence, describing the
action, is the 'verb' ('verb' = word functioning as a verb).

  EG  U kani bibe u hidra.  ...................  bibe  'verb'
             ~~~~
   [The dog drinks the water.]

  EG  An fo hedo bibe.  .......................  hedo  'verb'
            ~~~~   ............................  bibe  'gerund' (verb/noun)
   [He very-much enjoys to drink/drinking.]

  EG  Mi don ad un equs id bibe.  .............  don(a)  'verb'
         ~~~        ...........................  bibe  'noun'
   [I give (to) the horse its drink.]

N.B. 'verb' =  word functioning as a verb
     'noun' =  word functioning as a noun
      ' X ' =  word functioning as an  X

"IS" IN ENGLISH
                 This word is used in many different ways in English, but,
in Glosa, the "is" concept is conveyed more accurately - using a range of
'verbs'.  As an 'action' its original function was to represent an "equals"
sign, EG "He is John."  Glosa translations for various uses of "is" in
English are:-

  es  -  to be, is (has equivalence with), has the essence of
  habe - has the property (quality) of
  gene - gets to be, becomes
  eqa - equals, measures

Examples:
    Fe es u ju-fe.
   [She is a girl.]
    An es u filosofi-pe.
   [He is a philosopher.]

    U meteo habe frigo.
   [The weather is cold/has coldness] [It is cold.]
    Mi habe fo lati.
   [I am very tall/have much tallness.]

    U meteo gene ma termo.
   [The weather is warmer/gets warmer/becomes more hot.]
    U ju-an gene fatiga.
   [The boy is tired/becomes tired.]
    Mi habe fo turba; e fu gene koleri, si tu ne sto dice.
   [I am very upset, and will be angry if you don't stop talking.]

    U temperatura eqa tri-ze grada (30`C).
   [The temperature is thirty degrees (30`C).]
    U preci de ki-in u teatra eqa mo-penta dolara ($15).
   [The price of entry into the theatre is fifteen dollars ($15).]

COMMON 'VERBS'
                In Glosa, some words are used almost exclusively as verbs,
and these are general-purpose verbs, such as:-

  habe - to have, have has
  ki  -  to go, go, goes, went
  veni - to come, come, comes, came
  tena - to hold, grab, take

VERBOIDS
          Some words, in Glosa, are "almost verbs" but are not "full verbs"
in their own right: they are not 'stand-alone' verbs, but they add to the
meaning of the "full verb", which is usually the final word in the Verb
Phrase.  These Verboids are half-way between Adverbs and Verbs.  Examples:-

  posi - possibly
  pote - can, has the ability to
  nece - needs to, must
  lice - be allowed, allow to
  debi - ought to
  hedo - enjoys, happily
  forti - strongly
  seqe - following, sebsequently
  vo(lu) - wish to, would
  tanto - so much, almost
  tosto - soon

EG  Mi fu posi ki ad u boteka.
   [I will possibly go to the shop.]
    An pote kurso fo celero.
   [He can run very quickly.]
    Kron mi voka, fe tosto veni in u domi.
   [When I call, she soon comes into the house.]
    Mi gina fu hedo kanta pro vi.
   [My wife will happily sing for you.]
    Tu lice habe id.
   [You are allowed to have it.]
    Pa noktu, mi tanto ariva pre u pluvi.  .. (Pastness implied by "Pa" so
   [Last night I almost arrived before the rain.]  'pa tanto ariva' wrong.)

AUXILIARY VERBS
                 These words 'help' the verb to do its job.  But they
usually follow the "main verb" as separate words, though they contribute to
the formation of a "compound verb."  Examples are:-

  ana - up   EG  ki ana  [ascend]
  kata - down   EG  ki kata  [descend]
  retro - back   EG  kurso retro  [run back]
  itera - again   EG  akti itera  [do (it) again; repeat]
  ab  -  away   EG  greso ab  [walk away]
  versi - back to start   EG  viagia versi  [travel home]
  avanti - forward   EG  ki avanti  [advance]

EG  An pa ki kata un orto-lo; sed an nece skende itera ana id, te
   [He fell down the cliff, but (he) must climb again up it, in order to

    gene an kefa-ve; qi veni ab an kefa pre an pa kade.
    get his hat, which came off his head before he fell.]

WAYS IN WHICH THE 'VERB' MAY BE MODIFIED
  In Glosa, the word functioning as the verb can be modified by placing
short words, called particles, before it.  These particles might alter the
time of the event, negate it, turn it back on the Subject, or make it
conditional on some other event.  As well as that, the action might act
upon - or not act upon - an Object; and then, for a change, the
positioning Subject and Object is sometimes switched around.

. TENSE PARTICLES
                   Dealt with, in detail - in the Tense Table - these short
words, which come at the start of a Verb Phrase, usually singly but
sometimes in a group, tell us WHEN an action occurs.

     - No particle before the 'verb' suggest a present tense (but can mean
        that an earlier time indication logically applies).
 pa  -  Simple Past Tense  (pa  [did])
 fu  -  Future Tense  (fu  [will])
 nu  -  An immediate Present Tense  (nu  [just now])
 du  -  Continuous Tense   (du X  [is X-ing, continues to X])
 pra -  Past Perfect Tense: fully completed.   (pra  [had])

  EG  Un andra nu pa veni in u domi.
               ~~~~~
     [The man just now came into the house.]

CONDITIONAL
             When an action happens only if something else occurs before
it, then we say that the second event is conditional on the first: in
English, this is usually shown by the use of "would", "should" or "could".

 sio  -  would
 sio debi - would ought, should
 sio posi - would possibly, could

  EG  Si mu gene pluvi, plu-ci sperma sio posi kresce in alti fito.
     [If they get rain, these plants could grow into tall bushes.]

NEGATIVE
          When an action does NOT happen, we indicate this using a negative
word before the verb.  This happens in English, and something very similar
occurs in Glosa.

 ne  -  does not
 no  -  un-
 nuli - never  (also used with 'nouns':  nuli ra  [no thing])
 ni X ni Y - neither X nor Y

  EG  U gina ne ki a plu boteka; ka fe vagona ne ergo.
     [The woman did not go to the shops, because her car did not work.]

REFLEXIVE
            When an action affects the person or thing that caused it, we
say that the action is a "reflexive" action.  In Glosa there are two
particles that are used after the 'verb' to indicate that the action is
received by the Subject of the sentence: one if the Subject is human, the
other for non-human Subjects:-

 -se  -  to itself, itself
 auto -  to himself/herself, himself/herself, themselves

  EG  Jon vagona frakto-se, tem an du age ad an ergo-lo.
     [Jon's car broke itself while he was driving to work (his work-place).]

      Kron fe skende kata plu grada; fe pa kade, e noku auto.
     [When she descended the stairs, she fell and hurt herself.]

TRANSITIVE/
        /INTRANSITIVE   While the standard English sentence, has two Noun
Phrases separated by a Verb Phrase, some sentences have no real Object -
receiver of the action: these are called "intransitive" sentences. Glosa
also follows this pattern:-

  Transitive  S-V-O   EG  U kani fago u karni.  [The dog eats the meat.]
  Intransitive  S-V   EG  U kani voka.    [the dog barks.]
  Intransitive  S-V(-IO)  EG   U kani voka ad u posta-pe.
   IO --> Indirect Object     [The dog barks at the post-man.]

PASSIVE
 VOICE   While most of English and Glosa has the normal structure where
         the thing doing the action comes first, and whatever receives the
action comes last (called Active Voice), both languages allow the reciever
of the action to get a mention at the start of the sentence (called Passive
Voice).  It can be thought of as an (O-) V (-S) sentence:-

 X V Y  -  X does action V to Y   EG  U kani morda un andra.
  .................................  [The dog bites the man.]

 Y gets V-ed by X  -  Y has action V done to it by X
  EG  Un andra gene ge-morda ex u kani.
     [The man gets bitten by the dog.]

                     G-ASCII Analysed Syntax (GAS)        File:syntanal.gas
                     -----------------------------             R. Gaskell
            <A system for analysing sentences written in a       Oct `95
                language that uses Syntax-based Grammar>

Rationale
        Perhaps it is possible to analyse the structure of a sentence by
looking at the function of the words - but replacing the words with symbols
that represent their function, to allow us to perceive this structure in
its abstract form.
        Since languages whose grammar is based on word order, and in which
the words do not change according to their function .. where "verbs" are not
inflected, and parts of speech are not marked .. there is a case for finding
a way of noting this sequence of word-functions.  Glosa is a language with
this form of grammar, which can be described as "Syntax-based."
N.B. English grammar is a hybrid, half of which is syntax-based, e.g. _Dog
bites man._ _Man bites dog._
        In analysing the style of usage for a language that has syntax-
based grammar, superior usage styles will demonstrate particular syntactic
patterns: the replacement of words with abstract symbols will make these
patterns much more readily recognised.
        When teaching the use of a language that has syntax-based grammar,
a system of symbols that represent the syntactic functions will allow
instruction at the abstract level.  Whereas children absorb grammar
intuitively, and build their own mental grammar subconsciously, this method
is more suitable for adult learners, who have usually lost the mental
plasticity they had when children, and who rely for their learning on
conscious, intellectual processes.  In short, adults learn through applying
principles, while children use the natural, unconscious method.  A system,
that allowed adults to perceive the principles of good syntax-based usage,
seemed worth developing.

An Unwritten Grammar
        Glosa is one of the few fully-formed languages that is taught
without the aid of a grammar book.
        The authors, Ronald Clark and Wendy Ashby, have avoided attempting
to tabulate the grammar of Glosa, suggesting that the language relies on
our inherent linguistic ability, and that a "formal" grammar would restrict
the use of the language.  This seems to be true; there is also the thought
that writing a grammar to describe the language of thought would be
difficult, if not impossible.
        People, who have retained some of their child-like flexibility of
mind, can intuit the grammar of Glosa, building a mental grammar for it, in
their heads.  Children learn Glosa very readily, because with its standard-
ised syntax there are few rules of usage, and these can be absorbed easily.

Syntax in the Abstract
        Although not wishing to try to write a "Gramatika," I thought an
abstract representation of Glosa syntax would be in order.  Then I started
looking around for suitable symbols to represent these syntactic functions.
While casually looking at a book on meaning representation, I noticed that
it was full of pseudo-algebraic formulations: I realised that most of these
symbols would not transmit through the Internet as e-mail; it would be
silly to use such symbols for a syntactic analysis, so I looked for
something simpler.
        On looking down at the keyboard of my computer, I found the answer:
I should obviously use ASCII symbols!  So, GAS was born - G-ASCII Analysed
Syntax: I started out awarding a different non-alphanumeric symbol to each
new syntactic function I found as I analysed Glosa text.  But, this way, I
was soon to run out of keyboard symbols.
        Becoming systematic, I wondered how many syntactic functions there
were: this was reminiscent of an earlier question about the number of types
of verbs and nouns.  We would need a rational number of syntactic
categories: not so many it was unworkable; and not so few it was meaning-
less.  Then I started to count the symbols on my 101 key keyboard: there
were the normal 26 letters, each with upper and lower case versions; then
there were the 10 numbers; and after that, I counted 32 non-alphanumeric
symbols.

        I decided it would be nice if the syntactic categories could be
restricted to this last group of 32 symbols, so they wouldn't get mixed up
with the normal text.  But, already, I had got up to 38 syntactic
categories, each of which had been awarded a symbol, plus I had another
seven categories represented as two-symbol compounds: this yielded a total of
45 syntactic categories.  I wondered if this was too many, and if I would
have to slim it down a bit.

> A somewhat daring claim, since "other grammars" are used
> exclusively in their mailing lists

I was on some Ido lists for a year or two, and though
the people (those visible) did use Ido, the level of
attainment was poor in all but 2 or 3 cases. I don't
intend to blame either the people or the language,
both were admirable, but this (Ido) isn't sufficiently
easy to serve as a truly global auxiliary language.
Even among Europeans the failure rate is too high,
how much worse among non-Euros? So I turned to the
more simplified grammar of Glosa, and found that it has
too many sharp edges about it, but that it should be
easy to reform, by a careful selection of vocabulary.

Yes, and Ido was a giant step forward. I am convinced though
(and so was Otto Jesperson) that Occidental went another
giant step forward beyond Ido, keeping its strengths and
reducing its weaknesses. However, I am thinking that perhaps
OCC is best seen as a regional IAL, for those who already
speak a European language. Current research seems to suggest
that only an analytic/isolating language can ever hope to be
an effective global (not regional) auxiliary. My criterion
is that 90% of the adults who attempt to learn it,
must *succeed* (rather than 90% failure as it is today).

Ido made heavy claims in this area, and these were IMO fully
*justified* at the time (1907 through 1910). The leading
theorist was Couturat, a mathematician of perhaps questionable
character, but other respected scientists such as Jesperson
played important roles. There is a wealth of information
available in James Chandler's web pages. But it was clear
to most interlinguists in the 1920's that Occidental was
far more advanced, so Ido lost most of its adherents.

It is partly unfair, but the issue is really Glosa not TP.
You gave a good example about "ku lida"; that sort of thing
must be avoided, agreed. Glosa can be more systematic than that.

> Being systematic, perhaps, means having an autonomous grammar.

As with Beaufront's Ido grammar. OK, I agree that Glosa needs
better definition than it has today. But people familiar with
creoles already know this pattern, which is extremely simple,
and maximally so. Creoles have been unfairly reviled; they're
as expressive and precise as any other human languages
(what they now term "pidgins" are something less than that).

> So don't press me too far on "systematic".  I mean something, or
> it means something to me, but I'll leave it at that.

Sorry to press, but it would be useful information.
Here are some of my concerns for truly systematic Glosa:

What are the equivalent Glosa idioms for the Ido suffixes?
Same for the top 100 words by frequency in English?
What are the semantic fields, corresponding with Roget's 1000?
Are there adequate meronyms for each category?
How is the genitive expressed, in all situations?
How are participles, if any, to be used?
How many and which verbs can act as auxiliaries?
How are determiners/quantifiers to be used?

Now I feel like venting some complaints, which is always fun:

Why are there so $#@! many short words that look
like particles but aren't, and long words that are?

Why is the principle of grammatical isolation abandoned
in a few cases? Inconsistency is inexcusable in an IAL.

Why isn't pure compounding used in the clumsy
anti-mnemonic "-BO -PE" series?

Why not jettison the ugly Greek roots altogether,
keeping only roots that appear in both English and Latin?

Should there be any participles or not?
Just one is plainly wrong, should be 0 or 2.

    If one is going to learn Glosa (or any other language, for that
matter) by paradigmatic examples rather than by formal exposition,
then, yes, I think there needs to be more connected text.  As for the
listening, for many of us, at the beginning, at least, most use of an
IAL will be through writing and reading.  I think there should be both
approaches, paradigmatic material and formal exposition.  Without at
least some of the latter, a lot of people are not going to take Glosa
seriously.

    There is the matter, which has been brought up before, of teaching
materials.  As I have claimed earlier, I think that it *is* possible to
make a good start on a language like Glosa with a booklet containing
examples and wordlists, just a little more ample than the existing
G.E.O. materials.

    (Although this is a side issue, I would actually agree.  I have
long been in favor of the Metric System, as we call MKS here in
Yankee-dom.  In fact, it has been *legal* to use it here in the US 
for over a century -- it is just not required.  Winess the nonsense
that if I buy a liter of imported olive oil, it is marked both as a
liter and as 33.8 US fluid ounces, which is stupid, considering that 
it would be fully legal to mark it as one liter and leave it at that.)

    *** Incidentally, I thought it was very worthwhile to reproduce
Wendy Ashby's letter the other day.  It was a good example of what the
language is capable of.  Unfortunately, I pruned my mailboxes too
vigorously and did away with it.

    I concur.  I think that the structure of the language is
satisfactory, "good enough" in the phrase associated with me, as it is. 
All that it really needs is more judicious use of vocabulary material
WHICH ALREADY EXISTS.  As those who follow the AUXLANG list will know,
I think that the quest for greater "perfection" in a constructed IAL is
in vain and may even be counterproductive.  One person's necessary
feature is another person's fundamental flaw.  A feature that is easy
to one person is difficult to another, whereas a different feature is
easy to the second and difficult to the first.  And so on and on and
on.  I doubt that it is practically feasible to devise some language
worth using which in all particulars will be equally "easy" to
everybody.  As far as I am concerned, the way Glosa is built is
adequate.  All that it really needs is some sprucing up in vocabulary
selection.

    I think that I pressed the wrong key and wiped out a message I
intended to send to the list.  If in fact it shows up, please pardon
the repetition.

    I was responding to Charles, who said that inconsistency is
inexcusable in an IAL.  I do not entirely agree.  Auxiliary language
design involves a lot of trade-offs due to competing values.  It may
not be completely possible to satisfy all desiderata simultaneously. 
Something may have to give way at times, and in the process what seems
to be an "inconsistency" may be allowable in order to accomplish
something else.  I do not have a specific example in mind, only that 
do not completely agree with Charles on this point.

    There is also an esthetic element, although this aspect is
notoriously slippery.  I myself am not especially enamored of
Esperanto, but some people have called it a work of art.  J.R.R.
Tolkien referred to this, and also referred to some language he
identified only as "N**" (probably Novial) as "factory product" 
which, despite its alleged superiority, was less desirable (in his
opinion) than E-o.

Conscious trade-offs imply a kind of consistency to me,
so our disagreement is perhaps even less than first appears.
Perfection isn't possible or necessary. But here are a few
specific, curable Glosa inconsistencies that bother me:

The GE- past/passive participle ... Why not have an
active-present participle (AP)? (Actually some Glosa words
*do* have an AP embedded in the "root", which is to me
a sort of "inexcusable" "cheating".)

Why say "Glosa has no morphology" when it does have some?
It indicates foggy thought processes. (If any band of
guerrila language reformers wishes to purge *all*
morphology from Glosa, I might join.)

Similarly, the -BO set of unneeded affixes.

The genitives/possessives are sometimes treated like
descriptive adjectives, sometimes like determiners,
other times like prepositional phrases. Too fuzzy,
not "systematic" enough.

In the latest note from Wendy, it appears the awful
semicolon of Hogben has been dropped, hooray!
But it still looks like relexed Brit-English to me.
I guess that's a consistency, but the wrong type ...

The less grammar there is in the language, the more
important it is. Glosa might do well to clean it up a bit.
Alternatively, hope that users avoid mis-features and
converge, as if by the economist's "unseen hand". Or both.

Karo ami, 

(Well, yes, I know, it is silly, if I - with my low English skill - 
would work on an English dictionary.  But because I criticized 
around a few days ago, I should not only talk.  And so I start. 
...)

A new Glosa dictionary is available. Please visit: 

 - Glosa-English: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.htm 
               or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.txt.gz 
 - English-Glosa: www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.htm 
               or www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gengl.txt.gz 

What is it? 

* Source was Bill Patterson's internet dictionary "Literary" (or 
    "Glosa All"). 
* Now it is formatted as an HTML-file with click-click-index 
    (gglen.htm and gengl.htm) and a plain ASCII-file (gglen.txt.gz 
    and gengl.txt.gz) for your personal formatting games.  Some 
    internet browsers decode the GNU-zip contraction automatically. 
* All three levels are in one file: 
    "Literary" is the source and it is completely contained. 
    Words from "Base"-dictionary (= all words without synonyms) are 
      marked with "+" (or "++"). 
    Words from "Core"-dictionary (= only most useful "Base"-words) are 
      marked with "++". 
  So a good overview of word preferences is given (although the 
  prefernces should change in advantage to Glosa 1000 in future). 
* New feature: 
    Glosa 1000 words are marked with "1". 
* To add the "1"-marks, I used the list "Glosa 1000 - English" from the 
    book "18 Steps to Fluency".  It has 1182 items.  (I know, there are 
    different lists of "Glosa 1000".  Even "English - Glosa 1000" in 
    the same book is not the same vocabulary.  I think, it does not 
    make much use to argue, wich list would be best for vocabulary 
    research.) 
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, 96 Glosa words have been found which 
    have not been in "Literary" before (mainly ending vowel 
    differences).  They are now added.  The words are listed in the 
    file www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggehist.txt.gz.  
* Looking up the "18 Steps"-list, about 170 English meanings to Glosa 
    words have been found which have not been in "Literary" before.  
    They are now added.  They are listed in .../ggehist.txt.gz, too. 
* As Wendy wanted, it is free available in WWW, but the source is 
    mentioned.  So, no password-locking is a hindrance to learn 
    Glosa. 
* Only the Glosa-English file is worked on.  The English-Glosa is a 
    simple computer reverse.  That could have caused errors. 
* Because I am stupid, new mistakes certainly were added.  Please find 
    them. 


What now? 

  The new file gives the possibility to access all Glosa words AND 
  to prefer Glosa 1000.  
  So, a text written with the internet dictionary can be understood by 
  a learner of printed vocabulary lists from Richmond.  Unfortunately 
  that was not so easy before. 
  
  Next step should be to supplement the list "English 5000 to 
  Glosa 1000" from the book "Central Glosa" to cover a bigger 
  meaning's field with the heart vocabulary. 

  Perhaps you have some suggestions how to do it.  As I wrote, my 
  scanning and OCR-text recognition failed (I tryed the program "Text 
  Bridge Pro 9.0").  Does anybody else want to have a try?  If it must 
  be typed in manually, does anybody want to help?  The "E5000G1000" 
  has 51 pages.  Thanks in advance. 

Saluta - Marcel <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>

I did not realize that she was releasing it; she said:
"Tu lice kopi ali-ra ex plu pre-PGN pro tu WWW.
Place dona fonta (state source)." If "pre-PGN"
includes Glosa-6000, that's really great!

Adding all the vocabs together, distinguishing the "basic"
from "extended", as you are doing, is the thing to do.

If the raw gif images were divided among several people,
typing or correcting the OCR output can be accomplished.
I would be willing to take a share of that.

Subject: [glosalist] vocabulary, word-building
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>

Glosa was designed as an analytic/isolating language.
Instead of the grammaticalized suffixes of Esperanto,
which are difficult or impossible for the average human
to master, plain word-compounding (hyphenation)
is sufficient to communicate any idea.

That intention was not always maintained in Glosa.
Many words carry frozen suffixes clumsily in the root:
FUNCTIO, FUSIO, GENERALI, GLOBULA, etc among the
"basic" vocabulary, and much worse in the 6000-set:
FUNE/FUNEBRI, GAMBA/GAMBADO, GELATO/GELATINO.
Much better are the words like GLUKO, GRAFI, GREGA.

As I understand it, compounding is the only valid
word-building mechanism in a pure analytic/isolating
typology; probably no natural language has ever been
100% A/I, but that's how I want Glosa to be, so one
could truthfully say that "Glosa has no affixes".
This makes it maximally easy for beginners, who will
constitute over 90% of the "Glosa-pe" for a long time.
(Of course, the syntax must be kept simple as well.)

To make spontaneous word-building possible for the
beginner (at least), there must be some system to it.
Certain kinds of compounds are so frequent ("productive")
that they can be listed, and mastered easily. Glosa's
so-called generics are a very poor set in my opinion,
both because they are too short (-BO -PE etc) and
there aren't nearly enough of them. Also, they're ugly!

http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/BaseTypes.htm

This would be a better bunch of generics, in "standard"
CVCV form, IMO. There is even a lot more material to be
mined there; the EuroWordNet project is now completed.
They have identified the top concepts across several
eurolangs (8) and it is modern scientific work, not
the sort that Dr. Gode faked in the 1940's at IALA.

To the extent that Glosa has suitable words for these
60 or so items, some of them coinciding with the generics,
there would be no change or additions needed, just a
presentation of them as useful compounding elements.

Then, a fuller examination of the 1000 or so "common
base concepts" would fill in the holes of Glosa's vocab.

    I myself am not so concerned about purity in conformity with an
ideal as with what works in practice.  Indeed, has that not been said
about Occidental?  As for whether an intention as an analytic/isolating
language has been maintained in Glosa, I think it it has approached
close enough as to be acceptable.  The prefixes and suffixes of which 
I take it that Charles disapproves are really, in my estimation, just
shortened forms of compounding elements.  Are the "-bo" series of
formants ugly?  Well, ugly is in the eyes of the beholder.  I don't
think they are ugly.

    One think we must beware of for constructed auxiliary languages 
is the quest for perfection.  It is a vain delusion and a snare.  One
person's necessary feature is another person's fatal flaw.  We will
never satisfy everybody.  Period.  If Esperanto were to become widely
used as an international auxiliary language, I would support it.  It 
is certainly a far sight easier than English, which is the most widely
used international lauxiliary language in history.  Of course, I think
we can do better than Esperanto, but in the end it comes down to
drawing lines, and people in the large will never draw them in the
same places.  I agree with Mario Pei that the quest for perfection can
actually be the enemy of the auxiliary language movement.  Good enough
is good enough, and except for vocabulary selection, I think Glosa is
good enough structurally as it stands.

    Learning vocabulary has always been my bugaboo.  I recently
finished a three-term course in Latin.  I had no difficulties with the
grammar (including, for the most part, the morphology).  Retaining
vocabulary was the hard part for me.  Indeed, if I did not have such 
a difficult time with vocabulary, and more leisure time to prepare
(something now in short supp;ly for me), I would try to write more in
Glosa.

In this case (Glosa) I think greater purity leads to greater ease
in practice. But in the case of Occidental, which seeks to leverage
the (European) learner's native language instincts, a quest for
purity is even sillier than usual when speaking of language.

I still want more truth-in-advertising: Glosa currently *does*
have a certain amount or morphology/inflection, but claims that
it doesn't. This, like the statement "Glosa has no grammar",
is at least a tactical error, reducing its credibility.

If it is possible to use Glosa-sin-morphology, I think it
works better ... and is more linguistically "interesting".
I accept the point about perfection being unattainable,
and even divisive in the unhappy history of auxlangs.

Thank you, you obviously read my mail of Friday.  I believe, Wendy is 
more friendly, generous and reasonable as we often think here in 
Glosalist.  Here I was talking about another letter from her.  But 
actually I cannot find it at the moment.  Hope that does not bring me 
into jail some day :(.  Let me say something to my defence:

- I really do not want to harm anybody.  I just want to help. 
- Remember, that internet is very young.  Maybe in the beginning Ron 
  and Wendy, as many other people in the world, could not see the 
  amazing possibilities in it.  And so the trouble with the 6000 on 
  the net came into existance.  Perhaps this is history, now. I, for 
  instance, would not know anything about Glosa without the internet. 
- When I started Glosa one year ago and I could not extract Bill's 
  dictionary files because I did not know the password, I was near 
  to quit with Glosa and wanted to take a language with better web 
  material and more generous promoters, already. 
- I do not earn money when I publish the dictionary.  If so, it would 
  be fair to participate the authors, of course. 
- There is a lot of advertisement for GEO on my website, although it 
  is forbidden (The server belongs to a University and is so somehow 
  governmental and must not be misused for profit by private 
  economy.).
- The difference between Bill's dictionary and 6000 is so big that I 
  would not say there could be protection claimed.  But I am not a 
  lawyer. 
- I bought books from GEO and paid money for it.  If the material 
  would be satisfying, I could concentrate on writing in Glosa and 
  communication and would not have to build up a vocabulary first.  
  So it is me who is damaged.  (And you, because you have to stand my 
  English mistakes, instead of reading me writing Glosa.) 
- Why not change all ending vowels into -e.  Then the copyright will 
  be goofed and we have one more problem solved ;). 


 > If the raw gif images were divided among several people,

Thank you very much for the offer.  I will send you three pages.  
Please tell me when you need another format (I personally think TIFF 
is better than GIF) or another resolution (I will send you 300 dpi 
because it is better for OCR.  For manual typing 200 dpi is enough.). 
Of course, Charles, this is really copyright violation, ...

It is only a friendly disagreement some of us have with
the authors, seeing them as insufficiently net-aware, etc.

It is an excellent site indeed. If necessary, we could move
it to another hosting site. Probably best would be to start
a "glosa.org" so all the various sites can be linked centrally
and search engines will find everything. Someday you will need
to move yours, I imagine. Fortunately ISPs are becoming more
generous in their disk quotas, and more people are hosting
on their own home machines (using cable or DSL connections).

You are obviously a dangerous radical subversive!
Tu es sura u risko rugo-rosa anti-crati-pe sed ko boni English!

(That's from Glosa-1600. I guess adverbs-modifying-verbs
should follow the verb?)

These pages are so small, manual typing is best, easy
to proof/correct; the pages you sent are fine for me.
You are correct, 300/400 DPI is best for OCR or small text
but 200 is good for manual input -- fits better on screen.
My browser does not handle TIFFs well, and I think
GIF/PNG has made TIFF obsolete (I used to work with
CCITT TIFFs, there are too many crazy sub-formats for
even software to tolerate; all those tilings ...)

One item, probably left over from a scanning error a long time ago...

   "adelo +   uncIear" in gglen.htm

   "uncIear   adelo +" in gengl.htm

Should be "unclear" {not evident; not obvious}.

(That's all you need to read of this post. The rest is just a whine.)

(Well, wait, read this bit too...)

Marcel, is the G1600 going to be posted separately, and/or merged into
your gglen and gengl? I'd like to see both, with G1600 folded into gglen
and gengl, thus continuing the evolution of the NetGlosa we've pondered
before on this list. But that's probably going to result in some more
irregularities. Glosalistas may want to take a look at my old criteria
page...

   http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/criteria.htm

where I outlined some of my ideas in re Glosa word selection.

And watch out for those final vowels! (What *should* we do with those
things? As somebody once pointed out (Paul?), they're almost like a
gender because you have to learn what vowel terminates each word. Except
that its a useless bunch of genders because they have no effect on
anything else in the sentence. We can't just drop them because that
would be harder to pronounce *and* there are still some words that
differ only in the final vowel. Probably best not to worry about them
too much, but also to not take them too seriously!)

(Okay, now the whine begins...)

Which also brings to our attention another of those multilingual and
prefix-that-isn't-a-prefix problems of the Glosa vocabulary... "a(d)"
in the sense of "at, to, towards" (explicit) versus "a" in the sense
of "not" (implicit). Eek! In Glosa, "delo" is "clear" and "adelo" is
"unclear"... but "a-" is *not* "un-". Things like this make it *very*
difficult to grasp Glosa's vocabulary.

One could argue that even though the "a" in "adelo" *looks* like a
prefix to somebody with prefixes in mind, it isn't. Can't be. Glosa
doesn't prefix that way. If it were a prefix, the word would be
"a-delo", which is obviously something other than "adelo". Still...
what to make of these words?...

re[+]    again; return to beginning
pro[+]   forwards
recede   go back
procede  go forward
cede     cede; yield
ki       go; move
ex-ki    leave

The "ki"/"ex-ki" pair looks okay. But it seems that "recede" and
"procede" should be spelled with hyphens. Except that "cede" is not "go"
(though it does imply movement of some sort). Eek again! Maybe we should
discard "recede" and "procede" and add "re-ki" and "pro-ki". Or simply
discard "recede" and "procede". Or something.

Maybe we should discard "adelo". We should use "ne delo" or "ne-delo"
or "no-delo" instead. Ah! That would be one way of simplifying and
regularising the vocabulary: eliminate all unique opposite and negative
words. In the basic dictionary, anyway.

I still think the vocabulary would have been better if they had chosen
Latin *or* Greek rather than Latin *and* Greek. That duality is the
source of many problems.

Glosa's grammar is its strong point; its vocabulary needs some work.

What is English "pity" in Glosa? "miseri". What is English "pitiless"
in Glosa? "neleo"! For a literary dictionary I suppose that's okay, but
for basic use it's overly irregular. One might almost think of Glosa as
having five ineffective genders and thousands of inflections.

("miseri manko" would probably be my preference for "pitiless")

And what is Glosa "leo" in English? "lion"! I know, no hyphen in
"neleo", so I guess we're safe there. Inspiration for some wordplay!
>From "miseri" to "neleo" to "ne-leo" to "leo".

> And watch out for those final vowels!

The beautiful *euphonic* vowels? Those are to optimize Glosa's
phonology for operatic shower singing. In my New Jersey dialect
they are all pronounced as schwa, and I have no intention of ever
memorizing them. That's a spell-checker's job. I could imagine
Glosa sounding like Valley-Girl Bantu; maybe they are tones?

I prefer CVCV Latinate words that lack any embedded prefixes.

It seems Ron Clark picked mostly Latin words, and the
Greek are mostly Hogben's.

Karo Bill, 

Thank you for your comments. 
I will be a few days off-line and answer then. 

The idea was only, to put the "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" list 
(from the book "Central Glosa") in your dictionary, and then 
change some preferences ("Core") in advantage to Glosa 1000 
(whatever Glosa 1000 is, we talked about it) with it.  

I did not want to start a new project, but to supplement yours.  
Later we can put the files together, again.  

Saluta - Marcel

*   I know Hogben wished to see suitable roots from both Greek and Latin,
but what I said about Ron Clark is true.  He may have started out with
Glosa unbiassed, but as time passed, he did favour Greek roots over Latin
ones, claiming that the Greek roots were muuch better for derivation of
terms and for the making of compounds, because of the superior
"agglutinative" qualities of the Greek roots.
eg  He favoured ~syn~ over ~ko~ = with
           and ~hidro~ over ~aqa~ = water.

Glosa was an 'International Language for Science.'

*   The directions are from opposite ends: the majority of euro-auxlangs
start from an acceptance of the status quo in modern Euro-languages, and
selects vocabulary from this source; Ron sought the most common present-day
words, and then projected backwards from here to the roots of these common
words, and built the glosa lexicon from there.

*   For me this is still true: I recognise the need for solidity in the
Learner's Vocabulary, with only a word a concept; but, for satisfying
communication, I have felt the need, personally, for the enhanced lexicon
giving the flexibility and avoidance of repetiition that can only come with
the presence of adequate synonyms.

Saluta,
  Robin

      When you say "your" do you mean "Glosalist's"?

*   Please, Alexander, avoid such negative mental conditioning; your mind
is not yet fluent in thinking in Glosa.
    As far as I am concerned, the real secret about Glosa is learning to
thinkin a fairly objective (non-idiomatic) way about what you intend to
say.  After this, run snippets of phrases through your mind to see how they
"feel".  The next bit is to form complete phrases, so that when you say
them to yourself they retain the original meaning you intended .. and your
mind gets the "sensation" of the original intention, without thinking of
the actual language you are using.  After being happy with the phrase
stage, ^clicking^ these together to make full sentences in faily easy.
    Using clauses takes a little more work, because you are asking the
brain to hold, at one time, a number of more complex ideas, plus their
inter-connections.  Doing this all in Glosa requires a reasonable memory of
the necessary Glosa words, plus a fair understanding of the syntax
structures, and a facility with the phrasal structures associated with the
different words.
  EG     a fe domi       ex plu boteka      merca u sito

    fe pa ki a fe domi    veni ex plu boteka     seqe merca u sito

       Seqe merca u sito, e veni ex plu boteka, fe pa ki a fe domi.

*   Glad you like it.  You might wish to put some of the questions, and
your answers to them, on Glosalist.
    This is a very basic level of instruction in Glosa.  Let me know when
you need further exercises, and I will attempt to supply them.

Saluta,
  Robin

Mali, kako! (I exaggerate for comic effect.)

A great advantage of analytic/isolating typology
is the ease of adding vocabulary from any source,
as long as the basic CVcv phonology (initial stress)
is not violated. I was just thinking of this:

SUtra ... a small strand/thread/line of thought

It doesn't matter whether such a term is pronounced
with a proper /a/ or not, unstressed vowels are
indistinct in speech and can't be heard amid noise.
However, Brits really must pronounce R somehow ...

To permit lexical differences marked only by one final
(unstressed) vowel is a flat-out loser of an idea.
English speakers cannot pronounce -e /e/ or -o /o/,
and will certainly (ab-)use schwa for -a /a/.
Lose the English speakers, and Glosa has no base.

The solution is to bow to linguistic reality and let
the finals "float", i.e. vary in spelling. They're
purely cosmetic, for ease and grace of pronunciation.
The few Glosa pairs like BALI/BALE should be fixed.

Occidental mainly abandoned use of final vowels for
syntactic use ala Esperanto/Ido. It was a good move;
De Wahl wrote about the phonological difficulties of
unstressed syllables such as -va/-ra/etc for tense,
which led him to use analytical auxiliaries ha/va
just as Glosa uses pa/fu. Convergent evolution ...

I went looking for Glosa words containing Y
and there sure aren't many ...

The 33 words in J look like this:

JA yes
JACE lie down {to}
JAKETA jacket
JAKULA throw
JAM already
JANUA door; entrance
JANUARI January
JARDINA garden {to}
JEJUNO fast {to}
JENTA breakfast {to}
JIGA jig
JOIEL jewel
JOKO joke; joke {play a}
JOKULA juggle
JOVIALI jovial
JU-AN boy
JU-FE girl
JUBA mane
JUBILA joy-shout
JUDIKA decide; judge
JUGA join; yoke
JULI July
JUNGLA jungle
JUNI June
JUNKTI joined
JUNKUS rush {plant}
JURA swear oath
JURGA quarrel
JURNALI newspaper
JURNALISTI journalist
JUSTI fair {equitable}; just {equitable}
JUVE youth; youthful
JUVENI young
JUXTA next to

Um, now guess how J is supposed to be pronounced?

Not many X's or even Z's or Q's.

Is W now allowed or not?

In an auxlang designed for world use,
where rapid acquisition is the #1 priority,
why not simplify a little where possible?
Some light-hearted proposals:

J ... to be pronounced as /dZ/ (English "J")
      *or* as /Z/ (French "J")
      *or* as /j/ (English "Y"), as at present

Y ... to be eliminated from Glosa

Z ... to be merged with S, Z itself eliminated
      (as in the Costa-Gavras movie)

C ... to be eliminated, replaced by K or S

Q ... replaced by KW xor KV (either but not both)

W ... maybe better just use V instead

    I do not agree.  We English speakers -- Americans, at least; I will
not claim for others -- must realize that just because we have slovenly
speech habits, that is not an excuse for allowing or expecting
slovenliness in an auxiliary language.  Does all the rest of the world
have to conform to our sloppiness?  Might not others in the world
justifiably expect *us* to tighten up a little instead?  For that
matter, some languages speak syllables more or less with equal stress,
so there need not necessarily even *be* such a thing as an unstressed
syllable in an auxiliary language.  Let us not be seduced into taking
our native habits as always some sort of universals.

    English, despite its heavily latinate vocabulary, is structurally 
a germanic language in which, to some extent, consonants are more
important than vowels.  But in other languages, vowels have much more
importance than they do in English.  To speakers of such languages,
fine distinctions of vowels which to us are absurd are to them quite
normal.  Maybe everybody needs to be willing to give a little, and for
us that might mean more care with vowels than we are accustomed to.

    However, English speakers really must pronounce vowels better
somehow.

    Perhaps only to speakers of languages in which vowel distinctions
are less important than consonant distinctions.  See above.  I simply
do not agree.  All I want is consistency across wordlists.

    Then let's scrap Glosa (and every other constructed auxlang) 
and have everybody speak English.  After all, English is the most 
successful auxiliary language in history.  Why not stick with a 
winner?

I don't think that's relevant.  Dutch is a germanic language.  
Compare the English (language) and Dutch pronunciations of
"Haarlem".  In both cases the stress is on the first syllable.  
In English, the vowel pronounced between the L and the M is the
one that is pronounced between the B and the L of "able".  In
Dutch, what is heard between the L and the M is the vowel (short)  
E pronounced with absolute clarity.

The issue with an IAL is that it has to be defined, and then there
has to be conformity with the definition, because that's all there
is, that's what the language is, that is the whole universe.  The
pronunciations of the vowels are specified.  You pronounce them
according to specification.  No ifs or buts or sometimes.  You
have to assume that the definition of the IAL is complete.  You
don't swallow vowels because no method of doing that, no protocol
as to when to do it, and no corresponding pronunciation, has been
specified.

I wouldn't call it slovenly though; we simply stress our first
syllables strongly in good Germanic style. Glosa's phonology
depends upon it; so it is built-into both English and Glosa.
The particles seem to get a secondary stress. This is why
you *can* hear those hyphens in compounds. Without the strong
stress pattern, it would all just turn to mush.

> some languages speak syllables more or less with equal stress,

Yes, but Glosa has stress-timing rather than syllable-timing.

> important than vowels.

Same for Italic languages, because Indo-European was even more so.
In the latinate vocabulary, consonants carry roughly 16 bits
per word, vowels 4 bits. But by not populating all the possible
combinations, it becomes easier to distinguish speech (redundancy).
Having chosen 5 vowels and 15-20 consonants, inevitably the C's
are more important than V's ... and then etymology of the roots
just reinforces that tendency. No way we could change the
first vowel in most roots; and no way to remember the second.
I'm only arguing for ease of learning and use -- it matters!
(Actually, the most vocalic language I've heard was Tahitian,
and even there the consonants dominate.)

> Maybe everybody needs to be willing to give a little, and for

Yes, and even more so for consonants; L/R is difficult for many.
Given the latinate bias, we are stuck with both F/V.
But there is little need or use for the S/Z distinction.

> All I want is consistency across wordlists.

That is certainly achievable. But I'll never be able to
memorize etymologically wrong final vowels, and nobody
who knows "silvi" will fail to understand "silva".

One might want to co-opt the leader to win in the marketplace.
Nobody but a few Americans and British have heard of Glosa,
so they must be coddled a little. If it were difficult to do,
then it wouldn't be worth the effort, but this is so easy.

"In Glosa, final vowels don't matter, they just sound nice."

Yes, once Glosa becomes "frozen" in its design ...
but as it is, Glosa looks quite unfinished to me.
Are W and Y in the alphabet? Undefined.
Esperanto froze (in terror?) its inadequate design.
An IAL must evolve more quickly than that.

No, in order for it to have a design.  You are talking about
modifying the design.  That's fine, but off the point.  In fact
you are not (so far) even doing that, but merely subverting the
design.  Saying, ignore it, and pronounce as in English.

Fine.  All you have do to is write a pronunciation guide for Glosa
which places within the language the vowel pronunciations that you
think are needed at the places where you think they are needed.

Sorry, I'm a dummy.  You'd need to make it clearer for me.

However (sorry to butt in on this one) Sid sent a large graphics
file.  He sent it by mistake.  Many people could not read
it.  Some e-mail transport programs rejected it.  Alexander, this 
happened just before you reported your problem.  Is it the same

    There are several wordlists which could serve as at least
preliminary guides.  Rick Harrison, with assistance from others,
compiled what I think he may have called his Universal Language
Dictionary (ULD).  I don't have a current URL.  A couple of years ago,
I collated the wordlists of Basic English, Essential World English, and
the Longman Defining Vocabulary.  The collated list in ASCII text
format is at ftp://ftp.smart.net/pub/bartlett/base.vocabulary .

    I do not suggest that somehow there be some sort of slavish one 
for one word substitution between a basic Glosa dictionary and such
wordlists (especially the one I collated, because E.W.E. may rely on
some of the principle of Basic English, which I consider basically
fraudulent).  However, if a Glosa dictionary has sufficient vocabulary
to express what these sorts of lists express, then I would think well
of it.

*    These are in my understanding transitional, residual forms:
The "Y" comes in a few words, mainly from Greek, and will ultimately be
replaced by an "I".
     "W" occurs in very few Classical roots, so will not be seen in most
Glosa texts.  I cannot see that there need be a special ruling on either of
these letters.
     Because the Glosa treatment of proper nouns has them rendered as they
are in the original language, then these 'strange' letters will still be
used for Place names and "foreign" personal names.  EG  William Healy pa
habe meso-vora ko an amika, Yonny Zerow, ex Woyabi intra Zambia.

     I think these letters can be 'tolerated.'

Saluta,
  Robin

The criteria are good.  Please one further criterium: 
Prefer "Glosa 1000"!  

I am afraid, we need a discussion protocol for every word.  A simple 
start is my collection of your Glosalist-mails in the file 
  www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/ggehist.txt.gz.  


 > Maybe we should discard "adelo". We should use "ne delo" or

I agree with you: 

  adelo (unclear) ---> no-delo 

A similar example: 

  absenti (absent) --> ab-es 

(- Hyphen! 
 - Glosa-1000-elements! 
 - -nt- is Latin present participle marker.  Out of Glosa with such 
     things!)

Negatives and opposites are important, but generally bad style.  
Because it is not the way our brain works.  See "neurologic 
programming", "positive thinking", "auto-suggestion"... .  The 
American dream is "you can make it", never "you will not fail".

I do not know, whether you read my comments to the Internet Dictionary 
(my Glosalist-mail of 00-07-28).  I send it to your personal 
email-address.  In paragraph 3 there is a list of similar problems.

Opposites maybe should be marked in the basic dictionary
if they are included.

I wonder if some people on the list could **HELP** typing
the English-Glosa 5000 ... it is easy work though tedious,
and you learn the Glosa vocabulary better. Not only that,
but for each page (100 items per page) you do, you earn
valuable grouser points redeemable as complaints against
finals or grammar or whatever ... a great bargain!

I took Paul's list of approx 2700 EWE-etc words,
mangled and merged it with Rick Harrisons VITAL list
of approx 2300, and made a single list of 3028
"vital and essential" English words and affixes.
A piece of it (pla- words) looks like this:

      3 place
      3 plain
      3 plan
      3 plane
      2 planet
      3 plant
      3 plastic
      3 plate
      1 platform
      3 play

1 = appears only in Paul's list (625 items)
2 = ditto Rick's (340 items)
3 = is in both (2113 items)

This was easy to do using standard Unix/Linux tools
"sort/uniq" etc. I did simplify complex entries a bit,
e.g. "a/an" was separated into "a" and "an". Only
individual words were kept, e.g. "in favour of" was
dropped, "favour" kept. Perfection is unattainable!
Are there too many? I don't think so, because many are
derivatives; I'm surprised the total is so low:

      3 indoor
      1 indoors

      1 industrial
      3 industry

      3 infect
      1 infection
      1 infectious

      1 infer
      1 inference

I think it's pretty good for its purpose.

Charles does really a good job.  When   Y O U   will join us, we have 
it complete very soon.  The advance for Glosa's vocabulary will be 
enormous, perhaps historical.  Do not hesitate to contact me, 
m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de, I will send some pages "English 5000 to

Basic reference says:

        C always as CH in CHurCH;
        G always hard as in Go;
        J as the Y in Yes;
        Q as QU in QUick;
        R always sounded, trilled if possible;
        SC as the "sh" sound in neSCience.

There are few languages that distinguish CH SH K S and Z.
This is a needless difficulty in Glosa, which is otherwise
very easy to pronounce, more so than the other IALs.
There are not too many words using Z or SC that they
must be retained -- they even look archaic.

Subject: [glosalist] thoughts about dictionaries
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Sat, 19 Aug 2000 10:19:28 -0700


I have collected several English word lists such as
Paul's and Rick Harrison's metalists, and several
well-known individual lists such as West's, Kilgariff's,
WordNet, etc. I sort and merge and edit them in various
ways to explore what use they might be in defining a core,
base, general, or full list of concepts needed for an IAL.
I've also tried this with collections of other IAL word
lists such as Eurolang, Ido, Lingua Franca, etc. What
it all amounts to is a huge table sort of like this:

LANG1    SOURCE1  WORD1      LANG2     SOURCE2  WORD2
English  WEST     talk       Vul.Lat.  Xxx      parle

This is symmetrical so it represents a pair of entries,
bidirectionally "parla <--> talk". The whole mess can then
be sorted in various ways, so for instance all the words
equivalent to "talk" appear together. Then if there is no
entry for Glosa it can be considered "missing"; or if only
Glosa has a word for it, then it might be considered
superfluous for the purpose of a core dictionary. (There
are some exceptions possible but I ignore them for now.)

Occidental is also in a state of not having a good online
dictionary. I strongly believe that there can and should be
some cooperation and cross-fertilization between IALs,
especially those derived from european languages. So this
may be pointing to a combined database of IAL word lists.
It would be too big for convenient online access, assuming
52k modems and ISP limits on space and CGI, but not for
a home PC with DSL, which is probably becoming the norm.

Further ideas related to Glosa? I don't intend to talk
without doing, or do without planning, so I'm asking ...

Sounds like a useful way to see if all the semantic field is properly
covered. If you do this you need to allow for the fact that there is not a
one to one correspondence between any two language (as you know), in fact
there is a many to many mapping involved here.

In particular, when looking at Glosa, by design, a Glosa word should map to
a number of English synonyms and near synonyms. (The Glosa authors claim up
to 100 English words might be covered by one Glosa word). And also that many
"concepts" represented in English by a single word are represented in Glosa
by a short "phrase" of two or more words.

This is very true, and unavoidable between any pair of languages.
One way to solve it is to use "synsets" to differentiate:

ENGLISH             GLOSA
spring, fountain    fonta
spring, elastic     elasti

> by design, a Glosa word should map to
> a number of English synonyms and near synonyms

That's the "word-building" or "derivational" facility.
I have many complaints about Glosa in this area, where
it is not faithful enough to its own principles:

ENGLISH         GLOSA
submarine       submarina
submerge        subomerge <--- subO
subscribe       subskribe <--- sub

Now, the "subo=under" and "merge/skribe" are nice,
so why not SUBOMERGE and SUBOSCRIBE? With disyllabic
roots, it is extremely easy to make such compounds,
and they are easy to recognize in actual speech,
whether or not hyphenated because of the stress.
I suppose SUBO (= INFRA) was just an error in the
materials, but it avoids consonant clusters.
Otherwise, ambiguously parsable words act like
frozen non-compoundable roots:

ENGLISH         GLOSA
sudden          subito
sublime         sublime
subject         subjekti

Glosa has quite a few roots suitable for compounding,
and of course those should go into basic vocab;
Greek used root+o+root extensively and productively,
and Greek is the basis of Glosa (for better and worse).

No Catty. This is just not adding to Glosa's
use of internationally recognized words. To
Use something like SUBOSCRIBE is just plain
silly. Who in their right mind would come
up with such a term when the languages that
are at the base of glosa vocabulary omit the
O... why insist on putting things in to make
the language more artificial. Glosa is simple
and beautiful enough without all the faky made
up stuff. No I don't agree that there is any
need for a sounding vowel between the root.

Take the roots from Latin and Greek. Fonetize
them and make them work. It is simple and in
my eyes it is beautiful.

Since,
Jay B.

I took several (5) of the word lists, combined and sorted etc.
It looks like this (all the "cit-, civ-" items):

2       cita        quote, urge
1       citate      city
1       citi        swift
2       citri       lemon
1       citro       citrus, lemon
1       citronada   lemonade
1       citru       citrus
4       civi        citizen
4       civili      civil, courteous, courtesy, meek, mercy, polite
1       civili-an   gentleman
1       civili-fe   lady
3       civiliza    civilization, civilize
1       civismo     good citizenship
4       civita      city

The first column is the number of citations,
which helps point out typographical errors, and
which are the "core" words too, to some extent.
There are 8567 items in total, 5638 appear only once,
1401 appear twice, 1528 more than twice.

I am putting the file temporarily on my web area:
http://catty.com/~catty/lang/glosatest.dat

Columns are tab-separated, parenthetical info deleted.

> Next task should be the change of word preferences

I wonder how we should proceed, after getting familiar
with the material? For example, the FAV- words need
to be cleaned up ...

1       favi      honeycomb
2       favo      favor, favour, partial, privilege
2       favori    favorable, favour
2       favorita  favorite
1       favu      honey comb

... by selecting just 2 di-syllabic roots from proper Latin,
preferring the infinitive verb form wherever possible,
and converting -US/-UM to -O (and -IS to -I):

2  favus   FAVO   honeycomb
6  favere  FAVE   favor, favour

An alternative strategy might be to examine several modern
euro-languages instead of Latin. Then it would be "favo"
for both of the above, which is awkward, or just pick
FAVO/FAVI arbitrarily.

Then derivatives can be formed in straightforward manner.
I don't dislike final vowels when they are etymologically
sensible and phonologically easy to distinguish.

Of the 2 roots, only one is likely to be useful in
forming compounds, the other is a low-frequency item.
This could be indicated by bold-type or stars or something.
It would be nice to list the source word too.

This mail tells you A) how the Glosa words are built and B) how to 
learn them easily. 


A) Glosa words are built from (scientific) English. 
   e.g.: 
    English "graph-I-cs" = drawing  
    --->  Glosa word for "to draw" = "grafi".
    English "graph-O-logy" = science of psychological analysis of 
                               hand-WRITing 
    --->  Glosa word for "to write" = "grafo". 

B) And now how to learn Glosa words: 
   - Learn Latin                     !! 
       It is the source language. 
   - Learn ancient Greek             !! !! 
       It is a source language, too. 
   - Learn English                   !! !! !! 
       Necessary for the ending vowels. 
   - Hope                            !! !! !! !! 
       Hope, you find the mnemotechnic trick!

This mail tries to tell A) how the Glosa words are built [this time 
less cynical and I really do not know B) how to learn them easily]. 


- Some words are derived regularly from the classical words, like 
  Peano suggested. 
  Indefinite words remain as they are (ad, de, si, Greek: kata). 
  -a, -ae get (from ablativus) -a (silva), 
  -us, -us get -u (manu), 
  -is, -is get -i (turi), 
  adjectives -us/-a/-um get -o (karo), 
  verbs with -ere get -e (face), with -are: -a (lauda), -ire: -i 
  (veni). 

- Same with greek.  Greek has no ablativus, so take dativus: 
  -os, -u gets -o (fobo, orto). 

- Greek verbs get -o (1st person singular) (skizo) 

- (I suppose: A regular system will cause too many -o-endings? 
  Perhaps the language would sound too masculine?  From Ninja-films 
  I know, Japanese has it the other way round: -a masculine and -o 
  feminine.  However:) 
  Latin words with -us, -i or -um, -i do NOT get -o, but ???. 

- Latin -io, -ionis do not get ablativus-ending -ione but keep the 
  nominativs -io (natio, okasio, petitio, religio, tensio). 
  [My personal opinion: -ione is too long, okay, but even -io is a 
  part-of-speech-marker.  Is it one syllable (-yo) or two (-ee-ow)? 
  No, there are two.  But then it is too long, I think.  A lot of 
  these words are derived from verbs.  "pete" and "tende"?] 

- (I suppose: Some Latin words are in international use mainly with 
  their perfect-tense-root.  So they took this root.  That could be
  reasonable.) 
  Words built from the perfect-tense-root get -i 
  (I suppose because of 1st person singular ending.) 
  (cepti, fluxi, komposi) 

- (I suppose for the same reason, international use:) Sometimes the 
  Greek aorist-root is taken instead of present-tense-root (gene). 

- Species names keep nominativus (equs, ursus). 

- See last mail: grafi from graphics and grafo from graphology.  This 
  was certainly a way to build some words.   Very interesting for this 
  is the book "Central Glosa".  E.g. (citation page 25) 
   "ami-able    ami    friend, -ly, kind 
    amo-ur      amo    love, like"
  (That is why the book is named "Central Glosa", because Glosa words 
  are in the centre.) 

- There is an article in "Plu Glosa Nota", no. 81 about deriving 
  Glosa words from Italian.  Unfortunately I have not got it.  Perhaps 
  it is interesting here.  Does anybody have it? 
  On page 2 of PGN 82 (this issue I have) there is written: 

    " Glosa E Italiano

      In PGN 81 na pa dice komo Glosa pote uti moderno Italiano de 
      gene id Mega lexiko. ...
      Posi Glosa pote prende plu participi pasato, - ..ATO, -ITO, -ETO 
      e -ABILI; kausa plu-ci parola-fini es proxi universali in plu 
      Euro-lingua.  ...
      Holo infinito ko -ARE, ERE, IRE diveni -A, -E, -I." 

- Perhaps you have more ideas about the secrets of Glosa words.  
  Please write. 
  (I suppose/fear, there is a secret about EVERY Glosa word, and no 
  real system for all.)

  I asked Wendy about ending vowels, their system and perhaps notices 
of some of their consideration work.  I will report, when she will 
answer.  I hope, she is not angry now after reading my letter.

  ... is good, too.  Let us go both ways simultanously.  
Latin is good for systematicality, but without an eye on modern 
languages Glosa would be a step back in language history. 
Is not there a revival of Occidental (modern Romanic words) for the 
same reason, after some years the scientificality of Interlingua 
(systematical derived vocabulary from Latin) was said to be perfect.

Ending vowels, word problems,- what to do? 

Perhaps we can start a new internet project "vocabulary research": 

  - We try to find a system for word building (like the list in one of 
    my previous mails, but better.) 
  - A maintainer puts a list of words to examine on a website. 
    This list could be "Glosa 1000", a new "Core"-dictionary or a 
    list of the ending-vowel-synonyms (silva/silvi, kara/karo ...) 
    or whatever anybody suggests. 
  - Everybody can help then.  Picking some words from the website, 
    looking up the Latin or Greek origin, looking up related words in 
    French, Spanish, Italian, ..., English, ..., Interlingua 
    dictionarys and collect them, making a suggestion of a better 
    Glosa word.  Then mailing it to the maintainer who collects all 
    entrys. 
  - Everybody can do as much as he wants.  If he has no Latin 
    dictionary, he may have an Italian.  Another has no Italian, but 
    a Greek.  Some wants to deal with old languages, some with 
    auxiliary languages and another wants only to make suggestions for 
    words.  The maintainer collects all and appends one comment to 
    a word to the previous comments to the same word and puts all 
    on the net. 
  - After a while we write all together and send it with a nice 
    letter to Wendy and hope she agrees or she writes other ideas. 
  - We put the new words into the Internet Dictionary, perhaps mark 
    them with asterisks as not original but to prefer. 

(Sorry, I cannot maintain such a list, because I have no direct access 
to my homepage.)

(see dictionarys www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.txt.gz ,

  I would like to put the "+"s and "++"s to the "1"s 
(That means: prefer Glosa 1000 for the smaller dictionarys 
"Core"=++ and "Base"=+/++.).  

  This sounds simple, but it is not: e.g. 
 - After changing a "+" to an "1"-word in the English-Glosa-list, you 
     have to look up the Glosa-English-list for other related English 
     words.  There you will get other Glosa words, and so on. 
 - English homonyms (ring {bell}, ring {finger, ear})! 
 - Does the Glosa word really work like the English meaning? 
     E.g. "ab" is normally a preposition.  Or an adverb: "ki ab".  
     Does it really work to take it as an adjective "absent" or only 
     in a definite context?  Sometimes there is for one English word 
     no Glosa WORD but a Glosa DESCRIPTION given.  Can such a phrase 
     be equivalent to a word?  How do they behave in a word 
     compounding? 

  Does anybody see other traps?  And how to avoid or handle them?  
Please take the lists (../gengl.txt.gz and ../gglen.txt.gz) and have a 
try on your own! 

  For this work we need a new list of prefered English words.  
Because the current "Core" has now, after supplement of the 
"English 5000 to Glosa 1000", 3491 lines.  O.K, there are 
"honey comb" and "honeycomb", but they are too many. 

  I think about a list with about 2000 English words for "Core".  
Cleverly chosen, 2000 words are enough for standard situations and 
cover 85 % of English texts.  They will have less Glosa meanings, 
maybe 1600.  This vocabulary could be quite similar to "Glosa 1000" 
then.  

  We also need a new definition for "Base".  Former was: all words 
without synonyms (criterium English meanings, problem: English 
synonyms!).  Now, after supplement of E5kG1k, the list has 6884 lines. 
That is too much.  It should be 4000, or what do you suggest?

So, you think the 1401 should be the new "Core" and the

Well, I added at least 2 of the "basic" dictionaries,
so all the basic words should be 2 or greater, and it seems
in all cases this does happen. Most of the 1 entries are
either Glosa-6000 or errors. So the simple count is a very
good heuristic trick.

>  - English homonyms (ring {bell}, ring {finger, ear})!

That is why the best way to sort Glosa words is *not* by
their English equivalents; and just 1000 G's become 5000 E's.
Then you get a lot of entries like this:

5       acide   event, happen, incident, occur

These (ACIDE etc) are the best and most important Glosa words.
It is clear from the multiple English equivalents what the intended
meaning of the G root is. Then we don't worry about E homonyms
or vague meanings like this:

1       adveni  happen

>  - Does the Glosa word really work like the English meaning?

I hope not. Natural languages are too messy and complex
for the IAL purpose: a second language for all adults.

>   For this work we need a new list of prefered English words.

I don't know if this is true ... I found and combined some good
English learner lists, but if Glosa is truly systematic then
we should focus on Glosa. Comparisons with the Interlingua IED,
Occidental Radicarium, any Romance language dictionary, etc,
are very useful too.

But I think we now have the 1500-3000 words we need for
the New Revised Glosa Internet Dictionary!! Actually I would
prefer to keep all the entries (approx 8567) minus errors.
We just BOLD TYPE the basic 2000 or so.

>   We also need a new definition for "Base".

The top 1500-3000. Maybe we need 3 levels:
essential 1500, basic 3000, full 8000.

Glosa Classified from Robin, approx 1050 words.
Glossref from Paul, approx 1600 words.
Glosa 6000, from Bill.
gec.dat core words, from Marcel.
g1e5 words, from Marcel et al.

We can do that as a Re-Neo-Glosa experimental project.
All living languages evolve, and we can help that process.
Lojban implemented a plan for future growth and reform.
Occidental is inherently mutable to adjust to user needs.
To freeze any language is either impossible or detrimental.

>   - Everybody can help then.

Radicals and reactionaries and moderates can all help.
We should make one restriction though, once we get organized:
all discussion about change must be in standard Glosa.
The first step is to clean-up the standard dictionary,
without any reforms, just collection and corrections.
Then we can try using the language, with translation
in English or some other. That's my suggestion.

We can alternate the identity of the maintainer.
You organized the G1E5 project and it was successful.
I think my collected list is good, and if people here
accept it, then that task is finished. Somebody else
may lead the next step, whatever it may be.

About adding new vocab ... I think we should explore the system
of derivation, so that users can make all the terms they need.
The G1E5 list shows the methods preferred by the authors.
Essentially it is phrasal-compounding in the pidgin style;
the arbitrary words like these are not good:

2  rentiera      renter, shareholder <-- use "-pe", not disguised "-ero"
1  reticentia    reticence <----- we have "tace" to make derivatives
1  retrospekti   look back <----- should be "retro-specta"

Good idea. Do the safe and easy things first.

Easy to fix, though. After thinking more, it seems (to me) best
to do the least: keep just FAVO and FAVI, and change nothing.
We can do this for all 8500+ Glosa words and get a good baseline.

Both Occidental/Interlingue (IE) and Gode's Interlingua (IA)
combined and regularized vocabulary from several European languages.
IE focused on vocab and never had time or money for a completely
finished grammar, OCC focused on grammar and never finished vocab.

Perhaps the ideal is to combine OCC/IA in the obvious way.
Then users could evolve the "new" language by simplification --
there are too many grammatical features and words for world use.

Glosa can, instead, begin with simple grammar and vocab,
learning from OCC, IA, Esperanto, Ido, and other IALs
Mainly what needs improvement is the derivational system.

Too many collisions between common Latin words, e.g.:

mano/manare  ... flow, drip (eMANate)
maneo/manere ... remain, stay
mane (mana)  ... morning
manus        ... hand

No good way to resolve this traffic jam systematically.
There are more besides ... Glosa has lots of MAN- words:

4       mana      morning
1       manea     handle, manage
2       mania     frenzy, madness
1       manika    sleeve
1       manipula  manipulate
1       mano      rarefied
1       manovra   manoeuvre
5       manu      hand, hand over, pass {hand over}, smack
2       manubri   handle

Occidental has these MAN- roots:
maner = to remain, mani = many, manie = mania,
manier = manner, mann = man, manu = hand;
also: manna, manifest, manipular, manivelle, manovre.

>   Perhaps the language would sound too masculine?

No ... final vowels are always unstressed,
and rounded lips look cute on chicks. But Euros
don't like -u much, except maybe in Rumania.

> - Species names keep nominativus (equs, ursus).

Those -s words ... they bother me! Scientific words
(nomenclature) should be capitalized to show "foreignness".
Science is irrelevant to IAL use among common people,
and the scientists always make their own jargon.
Merely for propaganda, IALs invoke the word "science".
The correct terms are binomial, not just "Ursa".

> This was certainly a way to build some words.

>    "ami-able    ami    friend, -ly, kind

The method is good, but the components must be good too.
This is dangerously close to affixation, but it works ...
But tri-syllabic roots are not such good compounders.

ami-abili ... ability or worthiness to be loved
ami-agenti ... obvious, no?

All languages are unsystematic compromises, even Lojban, even
predicate calculus, even Java. But some are simpler and better
than others. I hear the linguistic police now at my door ...

However, languages really change through real use.  Artificial
languages seem to be somehow a prey to tinkerers (funny word) with
bright ideas not forged in real use, and not contributed by means
of a demonstration in real writing.  At the same time they (I mean
IALs) do not have the centre of gravity and the total weight of
usage which would allow them to shrug off attack, as it were.

Thus I suggest you need to be careful not to slip into the notion
of a freely reformable IAL.  It exists as defined, or it doesn't
exist.

Another comment, if this is about fundamental reform.  A Tetum
grammar by Geoffrey Hull will shortly be published, or so I have
read.  Not being a real student of these matters (I'm just
interested in a language for e-mail) I don't know how common
published grammars of anciently creolized languages are.  Nor how
useful the contemplation of one would be for Glosa developers.

But in case you are interested, here is a quote from the
Introduction to Hull's Tetum - English dictionary.

"... Tetum (like the other eight Austronesian languages of the
island, except Lovaia) descends from a language introduced from
the Buton region of south-eastern Celebes about a thousand years
ago.  Invasive Austronesian speech displaced the older Papuan
vernaculars of Timor ... and subsequently underwent the processes
of drastic structural simplification and restructuration which
linguists call pidginization and creolization...  Today Eastern
Tetum is a hybrid ... heavy Portugese superstratum.  The impact of
Portugese ... may be aptly compared to the massive influence of
French on English after the Norman Conquest."

    Perhaps this is a bias of native anglophones?  After all, I very
much doubt that an IAL intended for worldwide use can be everything to
everybody.  Why should structure always be biased in favor of
anglophone sloppiness?  Esperanto and Ido seem to get along well using
unstressed (by definition) final syllables as part-of-speech markers.

    See above.  I am not convinced that Euro habits must be the sole
determinant.

    What, then, would be a generic term for "bear," to include black
bears, sun bears, grizzly bears, and polar bears?

    Indeed.  I am wary of purism in IAL design.  There are always
trade-offs.  That is why, for example, 'ge-' does not offend me.

Nay, it is *already* officially part of the basic phonology
of Glosa to stress penultimately, not bias. I think Glosa
di-syllabic words sound very cool, like Bantu languages,
but many tri-syls are iffy, and there are too many mono-syls.

I shoulda used a better example: "Felis"; "feli" is a good
common word. All words in Glosa *should* end in vowels
(just my opinion, not a fact). The authors capitalize
species names because they are not part of normal vocab.
My point was that Glosa is no-way scientific, and those
ugly species names break from the predominant sound-pattern.
How about "Albertosaurus"?? "Buckminsterfullerene"????

How about a present/active participle to go with that?
The "ge" has proven itself useful and somewhat popular.

The present/active participle is just the unmodified word itself. There's no

  When you compare 5 different "Glosa 1000"s, you may get a 
Super-1000, but no real advance.  We cannot take glosatest.dat for 
making new "Basic" and "Core".  We would 

- destroy Bill's work!
    (That would be sad.  Bill did a good job.  It is only that we have 
    now a better data set.)
- get a lot of (bad and useless) synonyms! 
    (That was what Bill, Paul and Robin wanted to avoid.)
- and get other useless and unimportant words!


Examples: 

  We will have "aerodroma" (you marked with "3") in "Core" and "Basic" 
and "aeroporto" (2) in "Basic".  Or "aeroplana" (3) and 
"aeroplano" (2). Totally useless and bad synonyms.  But see Bill's 
word list.  He eliminated these synonyms already.  Let us not go back. 

  Glosa "adeno" is English "gland".  "gland" is not in your 
vitaless-list nor in Kilgariff-3000.  So "adeno" is not very necessary, 
but you marked it with "3" and it would come into the new "Core". 



  I think, the task remains (although I hope for other suggestions): 

- Put the "+"s and "++"s to the "1"s - manually!  And then, perhaps 
  after that, perhaps simultanously 
- Reduce amount of words in "Core" and "Basic"!  It is no perfect way 
  to take an English list for it, but your 
  http://catty.com/~catty/lang/vitaless.txt and Kilgariff-3000 would 
  be acceptable.

Good points. Mere counts are not sufficient.

> - Put the "+"s and "++"s to the "1"s - manually!

I could add the source-list for each word automatically,
e.g. if Bill's list was A, G1E5 was B, etc:

ABCDE   5    razo    graze, scrape, shave
^^^^^

Manual editing is error-prone and not fun! I looked at
the GRA- words last night and started categorizing:

2       grata   scrape, scratch
1       psesto  scraped
1       radula  scraper
1       raspa   scrape
5       razo    graze, scrape, shave
1       razo-me razor
1       exkoria scrape skin off
1       abrazi  scrape

That's a lot of synonyms.

1       grati           grateful
5       gratia          grace, thank, thanks
2       gratioso        graceful
1       gratia de       thank you for
1       gratia-ple      grateful, thankful
1       gratia-ra       reward
3       gratula         congratulate
3       gratis          free, free of charge, without paying
1       kongratula      congratulate
1       ingratia-se     ingratiate oneself
1       disgratia       disgrace

This shows some of the "crypto-fixes".

3       seba        grease, suet, wax
4       lipo        fat, fry, grease, lipid
2       grasi       fat, grease
1       pingui      fat
5       paki        coarse, fat, stout, thick
3       obesi       fat, obese
3       krasi       fat, thick
1       fliaka      fathead
1       adipo       animal fat
1       paki-fi     cable, cord
1       paki-karni  steak

The authors were obsessed with dieting?

3       grafi           draw, write
5       grafo           draw, script, write, writing
1       grafo de        describe

1       topografi       topography
1       takografo       shorthand, stenography
1       tako grafi      sketch

There's a model word-family.

1       grana           grain
1       granari         granary
1       granata         pomegranate
1       pomegranata     pomegranate
2       granita         granite
1       granula         granule
1       holo grana      wholemeal

All of these share the same basic root, "grain".

I think Glosa needs a consistent derivational paradigm,
and some clear strategy for final vowels. Natural langs
are chaotic, but a designed IAL should not be so.

What's redundant? If I write "edi kani" or "kani edi"
it is very unclear what it means. Any verb used as
an adjective will benefit from "ge-" and a proper
active participle. In the official materials, "nu-"
is sometimes used as such, but this overloads the more
usual meaning. If "pa-" is different from "ge-", then
we need something different from "nu-" for the other.
Alternatively, perhaps someone can cite *any* language
with one participle and not the other?

  Good news from you, Nick.  Only 19 items for "A".  E5kG1k seems to 
be one of the best GEO lists. 


 > ante meso-di  a.m.  [should be ~pre meso-di~] 

  I recognized it already, too.  The idea was certainly to keep the 
English abbreviation "am". 

  What to do with such words?  Should we simply write 
"pre meso-di   a.m." and put "ante meso-di" into the "Literary" 
dictionary?  Or is it better to mark them (e.g. 
"pre meso-di *    a.m.") as not original GEO?  This is certainly a 
borderline case, because the elements "pre", "meso" and "di" are 
original.  But how to decide it by a computer program?  Is it better 
to correct the list before or to make first a new "Core"-dictionary 
and have then the advantage to work on a limited amount of words? 


  I have the feeling that you (Nick) are quite near to the spirit of 
Glosa (perhaps because you read "Plu Glosa Nota").  If criticism gives 
that feeling, it could be easily accepted by Wendy, I think.

 [ Yesterday I got a call from Rainer.  He is a German, living in 
 London.  He and his wife Sabine are friends of Wendy (and Ron).  They 
 live only 1 km apart from her and see her regularly.  They want to 
 help Glosa and have e-mail (and are possibly on the glosalist already 
 now. Hi.).  Perhaps they could be a connection between net-people and 
 Glosa author.  
   He told, that Wendy is very sad about the death of her life mate, 
 yet.  Glosa work reminds her of him and does not make it easier for 
 her.  She is still working (in a print shop) and has stress there at 
 the moment, because her chief is absent and she has to run the show 
 alone now.  And she helps her mother, who cannot walk well. ]

Charles grafo: 
 > Manual editing is error-prone and not fun! 

  I think a human can better handle the language problems
(e.g. scrape, scratch, graze, shave or "a kron" and "a-kron"). 

  Your list (http://catty.com/~catty/lang/glosatest.dat ) is a 
supplement to human manual work, but (I think) it should be only HELP, 
not the work itself. 

  But maybe I am wrong.  Someone can write a program and see what it 
results.  Correcting the program's errors can be less work than doing 
all "manually".  Three possibilitys (all manually/ manually with help 
of computerized lists/ all computerized, then corrected), - I do not 
know.  Belongs also a bit to the programmer's ability (and to the 
English knowledge and motivation of the human).

So, Bill's "Core" is "1"?  Then I should send "Basic" to you, too.

Exactly! But after collecting terms manually for a hour,
covering only 1% of the list, I was able to do the whole thing
in .00001 seconds by algorithm. Anything requiring judgement
needs to be done manually, the rest automatically.

The real work at this moment is to discover
what to do about the inconsistent final vowels,
because that confuses the sort/merge function.
Perhaps only Wendy can give judgement on that;
I hope she says "Just make Marcel do it!"

Saluta, karo plu Glosa-pe!
Why current dictionary of Glosa has many words which don't necessary?
For example, GENE SKO - learn, APRENDE - learn, MATi -learn.
Maybe necessary to use words, teatra, artisti etc. which are International.
But some words are excrescent!
We don't need in adaptatio and in ADAPTA both, we must select.
(My choose is adaptatio - adaptation, to adapt, etc. And what is your
choose?)
Alexander.
P.S.
Now I am translating Glosa -all, and when I cannot understand meaning
of English word,
I search Glosa word in Russian, English, and Esperanto dics, and I can find
any Glosa word!
So vocabulary of Glosa is really International, It's grammar is easy, and I
think that Glosa need only in to things, which are: promotion and
minimization.

Subject: [glosalist] repair crypto-prefixes?
From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Mon, 28 Aug 2000 11:31:59 -0700

I preformed the following easy experiments,
showing how both Glosa and English unsurprisingly
incorporate a huge number of prefixed words
following the Latin pattern of preposition+root,
e.g. "rebel = re + bell". The most common ones
seem to be "con- re- in- de- pre-".

Taking the first 2 letters of all common English words ...
cat /usr/dict/words | grep '^[a-z]' | cut -b -2 | sort | uniq -c  | sort -n | tail

    582 ca
    618 un
    625 su
    755 st
    866 di
    923 pr
    952 de
   1307 in
   1718 re
   1793 co

Now for Glosa. Only keeping the 10 most popular combinations ...
cut -f 3 glosatest* | cut -b -2 | sort | uniq -c  | sort -n | tail

    136 te
    142 pe
    165 re
    167 me
    170 pa
    173 ma
    180 st
    195 pr
    265 ka
    339 ko

Glosa vocab as listed in existing glossaries (Glosaries?)
is not as systematic as in Latin or English, but *is*
somewhat easily fixable. The result could be a much smaller
and more coherent/powerful and mnemonic vocab. For example,
consider all the Glosa "KO" words:

Some of them are already of the form "KO-etc":
ko-co ko-existe ko-habita ko-hesio ko-labora ko-lekti ko-opera ko-ordina ko-proletari

Some are "KONTRA-etc":
kontra kontra-akti kontra-co kontra-dice kontrabanda kontradice kontraface kontrakti kontramanda kontrapunkti kontrari kontrari-pe kontrasigna kontrasti kontraveni

Anyway, I propose that we identify all KO- words better written
as "KO-etc" or "KONTRA-etc" then list them that way. Correct
pronunciation would stress both KO and first syllable of root.
This makes derivation both transparent and *productive*,
for free generation of natural understandable compounds.

This would clean up the new Glosa dictionary and break no rules.
One problem: some of the separate roots are not defined, though
obvious enough and easy to add. For reference, here are all 339
official KO- words:

echo `cut -f 3 glosatest.dat | grep '^ko'`

  Thank you, Charles, for writing your UNIX-inputs.  I always admire 
UNIX-jugglers (and GNUplotters, too).  I have not so much practice 
with "uniq" etc and pipes.  Then it is good to have some examples. 


  I wrote a little program.  It brings out a lot of nonsense and has 
errors, yet.  But perhaps it could help for my/our problem 
(change +/++ to 1s in www.tu-harburg.de/~smms1406/gglen.htm ). 
Its output looks like this: 

...
---------------
  19 abjekti          mean 

4548 meandro          wind along 
4684 meskino +        mean; paltry 
5159 non-amo 1        disgust; mean {not nice} 
5649 per 1++          by means of; per 
6826 semani 1++       mean {to mean}; meaning 
6920 signifi 1++      mean; signify 
7682 tem-co +         meanwhile; time {at that} 
8441 volu akti 1      mean {v} 
8442 volu dice 1      mean {v} 
mean            : Paul; Rick; Adam 301 
---------------
  20 abjura +         abjure 

abjure          : 
---------------
  21 ablati           remove 

 498 apo 1++G         apart; away; remove; skim; subtract; whisk 
1381 depila +         remove hair 
6519 remove ++        remove 
remove          : Paul; Rick; Adam 2926 
---------------
...

  (Explanation: Numbers are line numbers in gglen.txt file.  So they 
could be found easily with a text editor. 
The program takes one line, e.g. line 19 with "abjekti".  It takes the 
English meanings, here only one, "mean".  Then it searches through the 
whole rest of the file for all English meanings of abjekti and prints 
out the lines (with line numbers), where it founds them. 
After that it gives to every English word the information, whether it 
is in Paul Bartlett's list, in Rick Harrison's list and on which 
position it is in the BNC of Adam Kilgariff. 
Then the program takes the next line (here line 20 with abjura).) 

  How to work with the list:  e.g. "ablati" remains only in the 
"Literary"-dictionary, because there is a synonym ("apo") in the 
"Core" already.  The Glosa word "remove" will be removed from "Core", 
because in "Core" there is already "apo", and "apo" has a "1", so it 
is in Glosa 1000 and has to be prefered.  "depila" should move to 
"Literary", too. 
The comment "Paul; Rick; Adam 2926" shows that the word "remove" is so 
important (it is in all three lists), that it should remain in "Core". 
Otherwise it would move to "Basic".  

  I do not believe that a deeper computerization makes sense. 
There is too much to correct in the data 
(mean {to mean} ---> mean {v}, ...).

Those utilities, e.g. sort uniq grep cut vi, are for easy things;
but for everything else: perl and its associative arrays!

grep 'abkekti' filename

I don't trust the English words given as equivalents.
Better to use the Greek or Latin whenever possible ...
or Ido, because it fonetisized the vocabulary similarly.

I think it is much more important whether the Glosa word
is used in compounds, e.g. BATE:

24      bat       bata       bat
12345   bat       bate       batter, beat, hit, knock, smite, strike, thrash
4       bat       bate-tem   innings
45      bat       bati       deep, walking
145     bat       bato       deep, depth <----------------- different root
1       bat       ne-bate    miss
15      batal     batalia    battle
5       batal     batalo     hind part <------------------- useless root
245     bater     bateri     battery, utensils <----------- ???
5       batiment  batimento  beating, throb
15      batm      batmo      step <------------------------ different

In this case our methods agree, since all the dictionaries
think BATE is important enough to list. But in others ... ?

But REMOVE is not a good root at all ... it is a hidden compound
of RE + MOV, and MOV does not appear as a proper root anywhere!

5      ablat       ablati    remove
5      ambit       ambiti    moving around perimeter
12345  ap          apo       apart, away, remove, skim, subtract, whisk
1      cinem       cinema    cinema, motion picture theater, movie theater
5      depil       depila    remove hair
5      et          kin-eti   moving
12345  k           ki        go, move
2345   kin         kine      go, motion, move, move oneself, whisk
4      kin         no-kine   motionless, not moving, stationary, still {not moving}
15     kines       kinesi    motion, moving
2345   mot         moti      drive, lay, move, move something, place, put, shift, transfer
4      moviment    movimento traffic
15     remov       remove    remove

Here one can see many crypt-affixes. MOVE should be the root,
RE-MOVE, MOVIMENTO (MOVE-AKTI?) are derivatives, and others
(*MOMENTUM?) should also be buildable using other good Glosa roots.

I think we need to write them as RE-MOVE, AB-LATI, DE-PILA, etc,
so we can catch those horrendous etymological errors. I am not
worried about too many synonyms, because the popularity of each
word is best judged by the number of vocab-lists it appears in.

But I might reduce the *English* synonymns to 2 or 3 max per G word.

It's good to discuss these things: sometimes you convince me,
sometimes I convince myself ...

Glosa has 2 different word-lists CENTRA and MEGA. CENTRA GLOSA has only
~GENE SKO~ as part of its list; ~APRENDE~ and ~MATI~ belong to the larger
MEGA GLOSA, and are available for those who feel the need to use them.

CENTRA GLOSA is the heart of the language, but all the international words
are part of Glosa, and all the Greek and Latin elements that make up the
Sci-Tech  vocabulary. This results in far too many words for every day use
and our current dictionary project is trying to correct this.

CENTRA GLOSA has about 1200 "concepts" and 1800 words, with some "concepts"
represented by both a Greek and a Latin word. This seems to be sub-optimal,
but it has some advantages. Some people on the list prefer to use the Latin
word and some prefer the Greek one. We can choose for ourselves which we
use. People remember more words they use, so CENTRA GLOSA works with human
language skills. We only need to use about 1200 words and to recognise in
context about 600 additional synonyms.

~ADAPTA~ is the CENTRA GLOSA word.

  The trick was that the program takes only the rest of the file.
Because the beginning is cleaned up already.  So when you have worked
on letters A to C for example, then A to C of "Literary", "Basic" and
"Core" is really ready.  A to C are finished, but also D to Z are
worked on (e.g. "remove" of letter R) and improved ("remove" is
removed from Core and Basic).

  So another can take all A words of "Core" (because the A of "Core"
is complete then) and do some other researches (a next step already),
maybe Greek/Latin-comparison, hyphen-use-harmonization or
synonym-optimizing.

  (Of course, you can go the same way with UNIX-commands, too.)

  I followed just YOUR own idea.  And I find it is useful.  Greek and
Latin are important, we have to do it (maybe later), but they are not
so easy to access.

  I am not so convinced about the files you use for 12345.

  glosaref.dat and classif.dat can only differ from each other and from

Glosa 1000.

  glosaref.dat and classif.dat have been sources of Bill's dictionary

  You get only negatives (errors) and no positive information.  It is
like an experiment in physics, where somebody takes the noise of the

But where they agree, we have more reliable data.
So we can know theat CANCRI is probably wrong in its
final vowel, because the other sources disagree.
The union of these overlapping files is the basic vocab.
Then we have all the rest, which is the Glosa-6000
plus a lot of noise.

The most important words are always verbs, because they generate
whole families of terms. BATUARE was Latin for "to beat, batter,
repeatedly smack the stuffing out of something"; this led to
Vulgar BATTERE, leading to English "battle, battalion, abate,
combat, debate, rebate, abbatoire", ad infinitum.

So for super-productivity and its converse minimal-vocabulary,
we need a root BATE and the prefixes RE- AB- COM- etc.
Imagine a matrix/table of 20 prefixes and 50 roots; that's
1000 verbs if fully populated, each of which can have
10 further derivatives (10,000 words) by participle and such,
yet only using 50 + 20 + 10 = 80 morphemes ... Nice, huh?

Yeah, pretty nice, but...
Isn't this like reinventing the wheel? There
is nothing new here. It's like Al Gore claiming
he invented the Internet.

What I'm not sure about is that all this tweaking
of Glosa should be going on... On one hand I
would applaud the changes and welcome a sense
of accomplishment in root revival and logical 
derivation... On the other I feel like there is
a disservice being done to Wendy Ashby who
is still the copyright holder of Glosa. Why not
just make a new project language. First there
was Interglossa and then came Glosa. Why 
can't reformers simply make their own project
and stop tweaking Glosa? Perhaps call it
Kosmo-Glosa, although someone out west
might think it's too close to Kosmoglotta. 

Since,
Jay B.

I take it to be a sports implement. And so used as a verb "to use a bat" or
"to bat".

I think I didn't completely answer the question ...
I'll add on a few things here:

The authors of Glosa have (unconsciously?) included all
the standard super-productive Latin roots and prefixes
and many of the suffixes, but in a hidden manner.
Words like "REMOVE" are really "RE-MOVE", etc, and when
written with the hyphen, it is easy to sort such words
by the root (MOVE) rather than the prefix (RE) and then
suddenly all the word families become obvious. A good
example is SIGN ...

5       sign       a-signa   assign
145     sign      de-signa   design
4       sign      in-signi   ensign, flag
1245    sign      in-signia  badge, banner, flag
5       sign  kontra-signa   countersign

I am tired already, doing this manually. When all the
true "IN-" etc compounds are flagged as such, a program
will sort them all automatically.

>From such super-productive verbs are *also* derived
a huge number of useful adjectives, nouns, etc.
Not syntactically, but semantically. To "beat = BATE"
with something, a "bat = BATE-ME" (or something similar)
is useful. Normally one would use Romance "-ERO" etc.
and you can find various "-IA, -IO, -ISM" etc in Glosa.
There are many other such useful suffixes *already*
embedded in the Glosa vocab waiting to be dug out, but
they aren't as obvious or consistent as the prefixes.

bati  = bathy- = deep, depth . bathysphere [From Greek bathus 'deep']
bato = batho- = deep, depth . bathometer [From Greek bathos 'depth']

I see no reason not to treat these two words as one Glosa word with
acceptable variation in "euphonic" terminal vowel.


Any idea where ~bati~ = waking comes from? I note that your file also has
~badisti~ = walker. Is there a common "root" there?

> But REMOVE is not a good root at all ... it is a hidden compound

The CENTRA GLOSA equivalent would be ~re-moti~, which would mean "move back
to beginning". Glosa does have the "international" prefixes as part of the
language, but gives them a specific meaning, rather than the vague meanings
of the natural languages. IMO only compounds that make semantic sense are
useful; the rest of the 'hidden compounds' (for example ~kolekti~) should be
treated as indivisible, unanalysable units.

I think the "walk" idea is just a mistake, so if corrected there
should be just one root. For the sake of a respectable dictionary,
only one vowel ending per word should be kept, I don't know or
care which; there seems no particular pattern to them.

Yes, Glosa has MOTI as well as MOVE. But consider all the possible
derivatives and ease of use ... "rebate, debate, ..." and also
"motor, motive, ...". Occidental accepts MOVE- as infinitive
and MOT- as perfective forms, then derives the family.

> Glosa does have the "international" prefixes as part of the

Glosa is the same as Latin: "cum" can be a (relatively) specific
particle, while "con-/com-" are vague prefixes. I am ambivalent
about this practice, but it's not my choice, they did it!

> IMO only compounds that make semantic sense are

I disagree: LECT is one of the important crypto-roots:
"select, collect, delect, elect ...". Each of those has further
sets of derivatives. It's designed deeply into the system.

    There is a problem with this approach.  Glosa is supposed to
facilitate communication.  Suppose we have no other language in
common.  You prefer and learn the Latin word, and I prefer and learn
the Greek word.  We still cannot communicate, the very condition Glosa
(or any other auxiliary language) was supposed to ameliorate.

    I agree.  I hold that there should be a judicious selection of base
vocabulary and then that those who favor the language should get on
with it.  The quest for "better" can sometimes be the enemy of "good
enough."

So if Occidental is good enough for you then why
not stick to that... actually if you want to tinker 
then tinker with Occidental, and if you want ideas
on what to improve in it I'll gladly send you a list
of items you can play with to your hearts content.
Ask yourself, does Wendy Ashby want you messing
with Glosa? She has copyrights. Does your buddy
Robert J. Petry Jr. C. L. have copyrights on all the
old stuff he is dredging up and reprinting? Not at 
all??? So why not tinker with your favorite creolized
lingo? One of the faults in working with the
Glosa 6000 is that the lesser list is the one that was
endorsed as ready for primetime and good enough.

How do you react when someone questions features
of Occidental? Come on do the right thing, be 
straight for a bit and come up with your own project.
Then we could give you credit as the author and
lo and behold you'd be in the Auxilingua Project
pages. Although your buddy Bob P. might not
want to play with you on Occi no more.

Since,
Jay B.

Yes, I would say, it did look a bit messy. Please

We'll hack that bad boy list into submission.

But on second thought. Why not tell me what's
bugging you about Glosa so much that you 
have to change it?

BTW you haven't responded about the list of 
Occi improvements I told you so very excitedly
about. What say, mate???

You have let that lunatic provocateur mislead you ...
There isn't any tweaking going on, only collection of data
and resorting of it, and if Wendy agrees to letting somebody
correct the final vowels, then that too.

Of course everyone is free to cling tightly and religiously
to every typographical error: The fact that "crab" is spelled
3 ways may be a prophetic reference to certain people,
but I don't know which 3 ...

After looking through the mess again, I think I will manually
revise my column 2 so as to collect all the true roots together.
Since column 2 is a mere fiction, there is no need for alarm ...

  Aren't there enough unfinished language projects? 
Changing some ending vowels and re-sorting the words, is that a reason 
to give it a new name? 

  We started a project (supplement of E5kG1k to the Internet 
Dictionary), completed it and had success. 

  Now we are discussing/brainstorming about what to do next. That 
should be normal: clear up the direction first, then set the foot to 
a step. 

  The signals we get from Richmond are positive.  The copyright 
quarrel is past. 

  It is obvious: there is something moving with Glosa. 


  Dear Jay, I beg you again: please speak a Glosa text on a 
cassette.  The existing two cassettes (one Wendy/Ron, one Robin) 
have a strong English accent.  You, as a Spanish teacher, may help 
this situation. 

  Saluta - Marcel

From: Charles <catty{at}pacificnet{dot}net>
Date: Thu, 31 Aug 2000 09:49:45 -0700


Some people dislike the Latin prefixed vague prepositions,
and find them inconsistently used and silly in Glosa,
e.g. "su facia, su-facia, surfaci, surfacia" = "surface",
and "superficia" = "superficial". I mean the whole set of
"ab- ad- de- con- pre- pro- re- sub- sur-" etc.

There may be a usable alternative in the Greek prefixes, e.g.
"dia, epi, exo". They better fit the disyllabic sound pattern
and eliminate that just-another-Romance-interlingua feeling.
I am wondering if it would be worth the effort to search
systematically for replacements, e.g. SURFACIA --> EPIFACI.

This requires mixing Greek prefixes with Latin roots,
and moves away ("ki ab") from "international vocabulary"
and at-sight recognizability. But it seems more in
accord with the original justification for Interglossa,
scientific Greek vocabulary with simplified syntax.

As it is today, I can't see how to use Glosa seriously,
it's too much of a mish-mash. I re-sorted the vocab
roughly by roots and find things like this everywhere,
even basic stuff like "make, build, face":

faba            bean
faber           artisan
fabrika         structure
fabula          myth, tale
bene-face       do good
lega-face       legislation
face            build, construct, make, manufacture, produce
face-do         factory
faci            making
facia           face, features, surface
facu u neo ra   invent
ge-face         artificial, produce
ge-face ex      consist
no-face         demolish, destroy, havoc, undo
su facia        surface
su-facia        surface
faceta          facet
faceti          witty

So now I don't know whether to consider Glosa as possible
euro-pidgin (bene-face, lega-face, fabri-domi, epi-face)
or anglo-latin (beneficial, surface, facetious, invention).
I'd really like to know how others see it ...

I don't have a problem with ~a.m.~ = ~pre meso-di~ or even = ~mana~. "a.m."
doesn't abbreviate any English words, and I guess this is the case in most
languages where it occurs. I guess we should be marking any changes from the
GEO standard, until these can be approved.

I think these root families are very interesting, but I don't see how the
meanings of the words are related in present day Glosa. They feel like they
represent distinct "concepts" to me.

Very true, _but_ everyone's reading/hearing vocabulary is larger than their
speaking/writing vocabulary and it is this size difference that bridges the
communications gap that was about to open up here.

In Glosa we don't have an untouchable "Fundamento", but a series of slightly
varying word lists. So to me, it makes perfect sense to correct the typo's,
smooth out the differences, and establish a common standard. I doubt we need
a base vocabulary that differs much from current CENTRA GLOSA as defined in
the G1KE5K file.

A parallel English example would be "meeting eating" or "eating meeting".
Only a larger context would explain what was intended.

~Kani vora.~                                     Dog(s) is/are/were/will be
eating.
~Vora kani ne es mi more.~               Eating dogs is not my pratice. Dog
eating is not my practice.
~Kani, qi vora, es de mi.~                  The dog(s), which is/are eating,
belong(s) to me. The eating dogs belong to me.
~Galina ne es boni kaso kani vora~    Chicken isn't good as a dog meal.
(~vora~ = eat = eating = a meal)

In a sense they are distinct concepts. The average person cannot
predict that "sit/stand + again/back" would mean "stay/remain".
Yet that is how Latin and Glosa have chosen: RESID and RESTA.
I would have expected "MANA = stay" for Glosa, but instead
"MANA = morning". So it is clear that Glosa accepts the Latin
word building system of a prefixed vague adverb with a root:
EMANAte, IMANE=in+mana, PERMANEnt. 

But in a deeper sense there is intuitive "natural" logic
in this system. From a small number of basic verb roots ("trunks"),
the first branches will tend to follow the lines of multiplicity
or repetition or unification or metaphorical motion toward/away.
Those are the RE- KO- etc directional prefixes, and Greek uses
them too, and so do all the "international words" ... no escape!

There were very similar processes in the Amerindian languages.
I urge skeptics to closely examine the combined Glosa vocabulary.
What I at first thought was dispensable in the Glosa-6000 words
turns out to be the most essential.

But "larger context" is never a satifactory solution in any
designed language. Even a pidgin quickly evolves an idiom
to express frequent concepts. [I reformat examples below.]

> ~Kani vora.~                  Dog(s) is/are/were/will be eating.

Is that "dog eats" or "dog's food" or "dog voraciousness"?
Glosa has no morphological part-of-speech distinctions,
so "kani vora" is a valid (but vague) noun phrase.
Thus it confuses possessives, gerunds, verbs, whatever.
I would not accept your sentence as valid except as
a "telegraphed" form of "u kani pa/nu vora".

> ~Vora kani ne es mi more.~    Eating dogs is not my pratice.
>                               Dog eating is not my practice.

Vora kani es u menace.          Voracious dogs are a menace.

> ~Kani, qi vora, es de mi.~    The dog(s), which is/are eating, belong(s) to me.
>                               The eating dogs belong to me.

That is clear but too clumsy for common use. Glosa needs
both a clear possesive and a present participle.

> ~Galina ne es boni kaso kani vora~    Chicken isn't good as a dog meal.
> (~vora~ = eat = eating = a meal)

That could also mean "chicken isn't the average dog's eating".
I think these examples have helped prove the point ...
