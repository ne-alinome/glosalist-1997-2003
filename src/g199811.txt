Hello Friends,
  And welcome to new subscribers to this List.

    Years ago, while still in England, and in direct contact with Ron Clark
(circa 1979), I mused on possible ways of creating Glosa learning games.
    If Glosa words do not change morphologically to show AGREEMENT, then I
deduced that sentence phrasal elements could mix and match without having
to add  "-ed"s or "-es"s onto the ends of words - as long as internal
consistency of number and tense was maintained.
    Take a Glosa sentence, cut it up into its building blocks of phrases,
then start constructing new sentences from these elements by swapping them
around. 
    To make a point-scoring game of it, I chose the model of Scrabble", but
renamed it "Scribble" because we would build sentences from phrases (and
words) instead of words from letters.  Thus _Skribel_ or _Kruci-Frasa_ was
invented.

    Below, in Eudora format, is a series of dismembered sentences - with a
few joining words added as a leaven - for you to print out in hard copy,
cut up into "tiles", and then start _Skribel_ing with.  Feedback requested,
please.  A copy of _Skribble_, an English Language version of the game, is
"Attached".
    Skribel works perfectly with Glosa because "Glosa words do not change
for reasons of grammar."  _Aussie Lingo_ works quite well in English,
because we can choose to provide "tiles" that carry no inflecting words.
Could you learn French or Italian using this system?  Who know: I might
find out in a couple of years when my computer programming skills are up to
it.

    But where do you come in, and what is the pay-back for Glosa of your
playing this childish game?  Well, Banobi Herbert, in Uganda, has set up
the Rukungiri Mountain Gorilla tourist facility, and promotes Glosa through
the sales outlet attached to his establishment.  Why not, I thought,
suggest to Banobi that a suitable Glosa sentence-building game could be
both a teaching aid and a sales item.
    Through your playing Skribel, you could:-
 . help me to refine the game as it stands;
 . contrbute phrases to the general pool, and thus, contribute indirectly
  to the economic recovery of Africa;
 . contribute to the GEO, because royalties from sales of the Glosa
   version of the game, with your phrasing, will go to the Glosa Charity;
 . learn to form Glosa sentences without really trying; 
 . discover the truth of syntax-based grammar through direct participation
   in it.

    I will send the ASCII version of the phrases to Banobi, and will ask if
a suitably presented game might having economic value for him.  I will, of
course, mention that I have requested help with this project from Glosalist
subscribers.
       Sentences can grow by addition, and might stretch form one wall to
the other; but, although the sentences do not have to make logical sense
(see Glen Baxter), they must be grammatically correct, and have to be read
aloud with sufficient vocal inflection to make them seem 'believable.'
 ADVERTISEMENT: Entrepreneurially-minded subscribers who can see commercial
possibilities in the English Language versions of the game are invited to
contact me about such possibilities (Aussie Lingo, Ultra Lingo, Primary
Sentences, Crost-verbs, Yuppie Speak, etc).

*   So, charles,
   If you - and any other newly subscribed person on the List - send me
your land address, I will send you the IBM ASCII version of the Glosa 6000
dictionaries (with word translations both ways).
   More work is required especially in the English --> Glosa direction:
most (or all) of the Classical synonyms ought to be cut back, leaving only
one root as the preferred (or sole) Glosa word.
   Bill Patterson has created a list of English words - not in the Glosa
6000 dictionary - for which he would expect to have Glosa equivalents.  I
started working on this list but found it very slow going.  I use a short
Latin 
dictionary, and am struggling with a Moder Greek dictionary, as well.

   Once a standardised, two-way Glosa 6000 dictionary is set up without any
inbuilt inconsistencies, then we can set about reducing the lexicon to what
seems a more rational length for beginners (1500, 2000 or 3000 words), and
we can also release such a production on the Net.

   I wish to complete this project, to make room for others, such as the
production of a series of sound cassettes, and the publication of Glosa
readers for the benefit of learners.  After such learning materials are
standardised, and inconsistencies removed, then we can progress to creating
graded instruction for the stepwise learning of Glosa.

   As a first exercise, I would ask subscribers to compile a list of the
criteria on which to base their selection of words for a first Glosa
dictionary.
   Memory . utility . literary value . international discussion and
co-operation  . world development . tourism . trade and commerce . science
and technology .  
 health and quality of life . ease of pronunciation . relevance of the
concept??

Saluta,
 Robin

I have them now, and they are very interesting;
I write Perl scripts and use unix "grep" and "sort" programs
to compare and contrast with other online dictionaries.

I think the Latin dictionary approach is not so good.
Glosa started as Greek-root-based, but now over half of
the words are either just Latinate, or both Latin and Greek.
But I found that most of the work of vocabulary selection
from Latin has already been done for us, in Ido:

First, comparing the Glosa 1700 from Paul's page with the Ido 2000
list from James Chandler, I merged them into ...
http://www.catty.com/~catty/lang/idoglosa.htm
... and found remarkable similarity in the roots.

Then, I merged a larger Ido 3600 word dictionary with Glosa 6000,
and was amazed at how many, um, inopportune entries need to be
cleansed from the latter. But most of Bill's/Paul's missing words
have appropriate cognates in Ido, which after all was a cleanup
pass of Esperanto by Couturat and Jesperson.

This is eminently do-able.

I would want the vocab to avoid using the terminal vowel
to disambiguate terms. Please! A simple consonant-vowel-consonant
or CvCvC pattern for common (top 10,000) word roots is both
adequate and mnemonic ... the final vowel is going to be
indistinct and inaudible in real connected speech.

    On of the major hurdles of dictionary work is the sheer
manipulation of entries.  It seems as if charles has a good handle 
on using effective tools.

    Just as an aside for manipulating Glosa's vocabulary, there is
nothing Writ Large in the Nature of the Cosmos that says that English
and Glosa words have to map onto each other one for one.  In fact, it
is even conceivable that trying to do so could be something of a trap
or hurdle for learners and leaves Glosa-pe open to the charge that
Glosa is merely recoded English, in which case why not learn the "real
thing"?

To: GLOSALIST
Date: Mon, 16 Nov 98 15:4

Hi Friends on the Glosalist,
    In an attempt to keep the ball rolling in this list, I have thought up
a number of topics for consideration.
    Here is one:-  How will speakers of the IAL get around the matter of
gender, for singular pronouns, when the sex of a person is not known?

    In English we use "they" or if pushed, "he/she".  Taking Glosa as the
example of an auxiliary language, what could it be?

   mu [they] - following English's number bending
   an [he]  - assuming the old-fashioned male dominance
   fe/an [she/he] - being modern and emancipated
   pe [person-it] - being completely neutral and giving "pe" pronoun status

   and tricky gender benders mix and match the letters from "an" and "fe"
   fa [sh-im] - F(e)&A(n) .. taking the initial letters, and combining them
   en [he-sh] - (f)E&(a)N .. doing the same with the final letters

    How does the rest of the world solve this problem?
    Will Glosa-pe follow English speakers, and use "mu"?
    Must a specific solution be found?

    I feel that the possible solution that would be most consistent with
the rest of Glosa, and which would not be introducing odd usages is "pe".

Saluta,
 Robin

When I was on The Well, they used "pern" for gender-neutral;
"pe" sounds good to me for Glosa.

*   Not sure of the source of your claim that Glosa started as
Greek-root-based, even if you go back to Interglossa.  When I first saw
Glosa in 1977, it was predominantly Latin-based.  
    The authors wanted the best of both (old) worlds, and strived to
include Greek and Latin synonyms, where possible, if this did not cause a
clash elsewhere in the lexicon.

*   So Ido and Glosa share a common Latin-based core vocabulary at the
basic level, but Glosa becomes more Greek influenced at the broader level.
I recall Ron Clark's rationalisation for this: he said that the Greek roots
were were more abstract and permitting of complex word-building than the
Latin words, which were more concrete and specific, and less prone to
contribute towards the melded compounds.

*   Actually, I was hoping we could define the criteria for including
roots, or not, and thus indirectly indicating the optimum length of a
"Starter Dictionary."
    The official Glosa line on the (Cv)x structure is a sop thrown to the
Asians.  It was claimed that Asians in general spoke 'sing-song' languages 
whose words comprised one, or more, "Cv" units.
    I have observed this subsequently, after moving into the Sydney suburb,
Cabramatta - now dubbed Vietnamatta: *Hughes Street* becomes ~Hyu Stree~.
    And the Chinese chap, who moved into my second bedroom as a paying
guest and live-in English student, genuinely started off adding -EE to the
ends of most words that ended in consonants.  Trying to eliminate these
unwanted gratuitous terminal vowels proved to be a constant source of work.
    So, my experience, regarding a terminal consonant is just the opposite
of your observation.  It seemed to me that most with the background of an
Asian language expected words to terminate in vowels, and had trouble
stopping a word on a consonant.  
    On the question of disambiguation, there are not a lot of Glosa words
that differ only on their terminal vowels, so this is not as much a problem
as it might be.  According to the Glosa 6000 dictionary, there are even a
few Glosa words with identical spelling: the original intention was that no
two words should be spelt the same; however, in the light of reality and
etymological research, the authors found it hard to avoid these words
differing only by their terminal vowel, and even homonyms, in an
aposteriori conlang .. especially when the lexical source is only two
ancient languages.

Saluta,
 Robin

*   Charles might share with us the special manipulative facilities
available to him through Perl and Unix.  How might we all benefit from
their use within the Glosalist area?  I have, up to now, used the macro
facility of the prehistoric word processor, Galaxy, and DOS's SORT program.

*   Extremely true, and yet a falacy that the present form of the Glosa
dictionaries leads us into.  I know that a "word translation dictionary"
really is a confusion of terms, and, yet, the Glosa authors would still
have been working on completing "6000" had they set themselves the task of
writing a proper dictionary.

*    And so, we are even asking people to 'map onto' each other linguistic
units that are from unmatching categories: aficionados of English never
asked you to believe that their favourite language was a "concept
language"; but the Glosa authors have asked you to ^hold your breath^ while
percieving the Glosa words really as 'concept centres' rather than as
concrete representions of ideas.
    Perhaps the analogy might be the way that musical sounds 'map onto'
musical notation.  The Glosa words really are meant to be thought of as
'concept-words', suggesting that when we use Glosa we are ^sculpting^ in
meaning, rather than flatly manipulating 'labels'.
    Needless to say, I see many users of English as simply using labels, in
a rather unpoetic sort of way; while, still, I understand that the top
novelists and song-writers are recognised to be using English words in
highly creative ways - projecting the essence of meaning through them.
    I do believe that the Glosa authors sought to breathe this poetic
essence into the language they were creating.  This does not mean that you
have to be a poet to use Glosa, but, as in all languages, it helps.
    When I pondered the original Hogbenism that the modelling of semantics 
is the concept usage of language in Chinese, I did wonder what a "concept
language" was.  On questioning Chinese people about this and looking into
the ideas behind classical Chinese literature, I came to the conclusion
that, when the Chinese language was first formed, it was planned to be a
creative medium.  This was the only conclusion I could reach when
discovering that scholars had to teach learners the right way to interpret
Chinese texts: the words must have been being used poetically rather than
technically.  English, on the other hand, has been moving progressively
towards 'plain language.'
    The Glosa authors have tried to create a language medium that gives
people the opportunity of expressing themselves both in the modern
technical way as well as in the more traditional creative mode.  Whether
this revolution in language can be achieved through freeing the words of
inflection and centring the grammar on syntax (or even if I have read the
signs correctly) I cannot know.  However, I have had positive feedback from
China that Glosa's syntax is similar to that of Chinese, and believe that
the idea of a "concept language" (like Chinese) first floated by Hogben,
and continued by Clark and Ashby, must be interpreted imaginatively.
    To finish on a note closer to home, I would map from English to Glosa
via French.
    In English, we say, rather sloppily, "The water is cold."  Everyone
knows what we mean, but we have to invent a lot of new rules of grammar to
make this (slang?) usage of "is" acceptable within our text-book
understanding of grammar.  A glos of the French version gives us %the water
has cold%, and Glosa reads " U hidra habe frigo."  "frigo" here is a
modifier of "hydra", and yet you are going to have trouble pinning a P-o-S
on it: maybe, as I suggested above, we are ^sculpting^ with semantics.
   Glosa:  U hidra habe frigo.

The Romans were indeed concrete-thinking and direct-acting.

I agree the words should end in vowels, but the vowel
should not be significant, and no 2 words differing
in only the final vowel should be added.

But for criteria, one simply needs to compare how many
of the "basic" lists have a given concept, e.g.,
is it in Ogden's Basic English, is it in the
Essential World English list, Longmans's Defining
dictionary, top 10000 words in the Oxford corpus, etc.
Rick Harrison has a good list of lists.

It turns out there is a linguistic rule, Zipf's Law.
The #1000 most commonly used word in any language
will be 1000 times less frequent than #1. Hmm ...
my calculation shows that the top 10000 words in
English only cover 87.4% of the vocabulary; but
that includes inflected forms, so a more realistic
count would be maybe 3000 roots for 90% coverage.

I think we have a bit of a problem:
the Glosa 6000 is both too small for a full
vocabulary, and too large for a basic one.

Perl is a scripting language, a superset of Bourne shell, awk, grep,
sort, ed, and C. They call it the Swiss-army chainsaw of programming
languages. It is very easy to read in a file or two, sort and match,
then output statistics along with the data. Instant gratification.

It can work. Esperanto uses agglutinative word-building to get by
with less than 3000 words, so Glosa could too. Which would be
easier, though? Glosa syntax is far easier to learn. It must be
admitted that Zamenhof put more and better effort into lexicon,
but Glosa's development isn't finished yet ...

    My old hobby horse: if the only language we have in common is Glosa
but you have learned the Greek-derived word while I have learned the
Latin-derived one, we still cannot communicate!  Pick one of them and
scrap the other!

    I'm not sure I even understand what this "broader level" means.

    Say what?  The Romans did philosophy and the Greeks wrote law. 
There may be a little stereotyping here, and in any case, I really
don't know how this is relevant to an auxiliary language.  It strikes
me as rubbish.  Just consider English.  We have mountains of
etymologically compound words, sometimes from Latin and sometimes 
from Greek, and in the case of "television" a bastard of both!

    Apart from this roots issue, this matter of a so-called starter
dictionary seems to be something of an unresolvable issue between Robin
and me.

    Not just Asians.  There are a lot of people who have trouble with
Slavic and Germanic consonant clusters and terminal consonants.  It
certainly needn't be a "sop" to consider them.

    My problem is with the inconsistency as to what the non-significant
terminal vowel should be.

    It should not be a problem at all: such words should not exist at
all, in my opinion.  Clean up the dictionary.  Pick a single form and
go with it.

    But if they differ by the terminal vowel at all, then they do not
have identical spelling (or pronunciation).

I am a newcomer to Glosa, but I fell for Interglossa years ago.  Thus, on
the vocabulary issue, I think Hogben's original principle should still
hold.  The roots should be those used internationally in science and
technology, regardless of whether they are Latin, Greek, or Arabic. (The
three sources for most of our technical vocabulary.)  His aim was to make
most of the vocabulary instantly familiar to educated people.  (Of course,
there are not many of those left.  The barbarians are taking over.)  The
technical vocabulary is the same in most European languages, but I am not
sure to what extent these roots are used in the technical vocabularies of
non-European languages.  Certainly the Chinese are inclined to use their
won technical terms, though many are also familiar with the English
technical vocabulary. The Japanese are less so inclined, and also more
inclined to learn the English technical vocabulary as well.  I am not sure
about the Arabs. 

 The principle of basing the vocabulary on international technical terms
opens up possibilites of including terms derived from aviation, computing,
and entertainment.


On the question of a gender neutral pronoun, the Chinese have used a
single pronoun for he/she/it for thousands of years, and it seems to have
worked.  I believe the Turks have a similar arrangement, again with no
major difficulties.

    I have never had the chance to study "Interglossa" in depth.  The
only copy I know of available to me is in the Library of Congress,
whence I may not check it out.  John Schilke was once making noises
about trying to put in on the world wide web, but I don't know the
status of that.  Perhaps it is unfortunate that it came out when it 
did and never got a good trial.  I wish I had a copy of the book but 
cannot currently afford a used book search.

    To the extent that I have been able to be familiar with it at all,
I have tended to think that Interglossa was better than Glosa.  Hogben
did a fairly good job of justification (again, to the best of my
limited familiarity).  His verb system was ingenious and I think needed
only one addition to cover so-called mental/spiritual activity (unless
I am not satisfactorily interpreting what is already there).  Otherwise
the language generally might only need a little sprucing up for 
vocabulary.

    One thing I have observed about Glosa is that the authors (Clark &
Ashby) seemed to have "pulled" it to make it more like recoded English. 
In and of itself this is not bad, as long as everyone understands that,
but if it is more like recoded English, then why should not someone
just expend the additional effort and learn "the real thing"?

    I do think we need to be somewhat careful here.  At least among
the native English-speaking, even "educated" people might use many
words containing Greco-Latin roots as lexical wholes without being
fully familiar with those roots as lexical atoms.  Nevertheless,
vocabulary for an international language has to come from somewhere,
even if it is more or less ad hoc, like Russell's Suma, and I think
Hogben's proposal is about as good as any, especially if there is not
the root mutilation to the extend that there is in Glosa.

    As I see it, an IAL needs a base vocabulary and a principle or
principles for incorporating proper nouns/adjectives and specialist
vocabulary.

    To the best of my limited knowledge, there are various languages
with sex-neutral pronouns.  They seem to get along well.  The Glosa
(and Interglossa?) 'pe' could serve.

    My time and mental energy are somewhat limited these days, but I
might almost be willing to give Interglossa a try if I had access to it.

In some ways, I agree. I want the light part-of-speech marking;
it is minimal and helpful, and sounds much better than Glosa.

But the worst parts of English, idiom and spelling,
are fixed. Hogben's was not a complete, speakable lang.
I'd like to see the two versions brought back together.
The dictionary still needs some work, I think we agree.

Language doesn't stop evolving. I went through the Interlingua
dictionary last night and it was obvious that 25% of the words
have become obsolete since 1954 (approx. when it and I were born).

One can now forget about "educated people"; Rome is burnt.
A vocab should have sturdy roots, and but few, for rapid learning
and universal applicability. It might be better to make them
wholly arbitrary ala Lojban. But they (basic 3000 words) must be
intelligently and scientifically selected or designed.

Starting from the Roget's 1000 is a good first guess,
but better information is available today. The Oxford
corpus of spoken English, WordNet analysis of European langs,
and other more recent efforts must take precedence over Roget!

Anyway, I see Glosa as the only standard-bearer for analytic
languages, which all evidence indicates to be the most
easily learnable type. As it appears to be still somewhat
unfinished, there may be hope for its future.

All just IMO.

	I did indeed make the effort, either to put it onto the web or to 
try to figure out how to make it available.  I have a copy of the (1943) 
_Interglossa_ by Hogben, and I, too, was much taken with it.  I still 
think it has great potential, even in its original form (with additional 
vocabulary to cover items unknown in the '40's, of course).
	The problem is how to do so.  I am reluctant to mail it anywhere 
because of its tattered condition (wartime paper was highly acidified, it 
seems).  Also, much clever use is made of coloring in its really good 
layout.  Does anyone know whether there are techniques for scanning small 
books?  This is an area of which I have no knowledge and would appreciate 
some advice.  I do have permission from Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby to copy 
it; they hold the copyright.  It is a 16mo aging Penguin paperback.  My 
offer to try to publish it still stands.  I think it would be worth the 
effort.  Please help!

    Glosa seems to be the only one with any activity at all, although
it has not been the only one.  Thai's FRATER (from which I worked on 
my unfinished project frater2) and Russell's Suma were more or less
analytic languages.  One person in Australia even reimbursed me to copy
the third edition of Suma for him.

    I agree that Glosa could use some finishing.  However, the major
problem, as I see it, is how to promote -any- newly minted or otherwise
not widespread IAL.  Glosa has such a minuscule "following" that for
practical purposes it might almost be starting from scratch.  And
eventually it is going to have to be dispersed in far more languages
than just English.  In my essay on "Thoughts on IAL Success" I set
forth dispersal and enthusiasm as probably the most important --
although certainly not the only -- factors as to why any conIAL project
goes anywhere.

   It looks as if I will have to let Ron and Wendy know that we have

I must ask them can we use "pe" as such a new pronoun?  I still have

    I thought that 'pe' was a THIRD person pronoun, not a first.  If
it has been discussed as a first, then I missed the discussion.

    This has disturbed me for a long time, as I have mentioned many
times before.  If Glosa is the private property of Ron Clark & Wendy
Ashby and they exercise complete control over it, then Glosa is in
trouble.  Schleyer tried to do this with Volapük, and his actions 
were a contributing factor to the collapse of the Volapük movement.

*   Robin, welcome.  Yes I agree that the Science/Classical scholar pattern
is sound, and does offer the widest global circulation.  While some
linguo-cultural groups have developed their science before European
civilisation, and others have developed their technical lexicons in
ignorance of the Greek-Latin standardisation, it seems fairly clear that a
European dominance of science on the global scale, is a fait accomple.

*   On this score, I have met Persians and Chinese who, because of their
national languages, have trouble with our male/female distinctions in
English pronouns.
    Glosa followed the English pattern - and I assume Interglossa did the
same.
    However, my suggestion was to find an extra pronoun for the "unknown"
sex, rather than scrap the male and female pronouns as they applied in the
Second Person Singular.

    I ought to attempt a table of how things are in this area, and I only
realised - as a result of this question - that the sex differentiation does
only occur in the Third Person Singular!

 ........... Singular .......................... Plural ...............

Hello John, 
  I recently went for my second Stress Test two months after the angiolasty
and insertion of a stent: this time I was not forced to stop; I hope that I
passed the 'test'.  Will find out when they see me on Monday with the
results of the gamma photography.

On reprinting of historical books, the NSW State Library photographs them
and prints the pages as 'pictures.'  If you get it scanned they will
probably guillotine the spine off the book.

   Maybe I have been uncritical, but I did assume that the Glosa author's
decisions to rebuild the language from scratch .. on fundamentally the same
principles as Hogben .. was well considered.  I liked the -a/-o
inflectional system that Clarke and Ashby had derived from Hogben's less
clear way of using vowels as function markers, but was convinced by them
that, with correct syntax, function markers became a redundant complication.

that Paul will not find Hogben's system as workable as he thinks it ought
to be.  My copy was sent to me by a Conlanger who had two copies: it is

Snapshots of it this way would cost little beyond the cost of the
electronic camera.  You would need a good word processor or DTP system and
good colour printer to let you print the pages as 'snapshots.'
    S'prise, s'prise: I did not know that Hogben had passed his copyright

    I thought that for people to uccupy positions of authority and

If we are to pitch our communication revolution at the rung of the Lowest

*   If these superior word lists are available in electronic format, I am
prepared to look at them from scratch, and reform, by selection and
elimination,
a Net vocabulary for Glosa.  To do this I would retain the standardised
spellings derived from Glosa 6000, and would use the modern analyses as a
guide to the best words/concepts for a starter Auxiliary Language.
    Two practical hurdles that make this work seem difficult are problems
with the typing up of dictionaries - one of the factors that contributed to
Glosa's long gestation - and the wide distribution of existing Glosa
dictionaries and word-lists.  While in an ideal world, we would all work
together to compile the agreed most suitable dictionary .. and upgrades
would be funded by the planet's citicens, as Paul pointed out, we are here
in an outpost of harsh reality.
    Now that I have a Pentium 2 with Epson Colour 440 attached, I can think
about DTPing an electronic dictionary so that it can be sent to the Third
World.
What this means is that I am looking both ways: a Public Domain Net
dictionary will be usable throughout the affluent world, and will enhance
the dispersion of Glosa in the 'North'; while an easily-printed paper
version of the same will ensure that Glosa-pe of the 'South' can
communicate ^across the equator^ without any vocabulary miss-matches.
    And here is the "but."  But, if a 'superior' scientifically derived
*glos*a
dictionary varies considerably form the dictionaries that have been in
circulation over the past decade - in spelling or word selection, or both -
then we are liable to compromise the existing user base.  
    If, as well as drastically revising the lexicon, we start to
re-introduce the use of a minimal inflectional system - mainly to indicate
a word's functioning as this, or that, part of speech - then we will
introduce a confusion where one did not exist, before.  Such an act would,
I believe, set back both the cause of World Language Reform and the
language Glosa.  And, while Paul suggest that the welfare of the Glosa
authors should not be a factor in the equation, such an action, if not
handled with tact and diplomacy, would be hard on them, also.
    Here my vote can be recorded as one for consolidating the gains made,
to date, and in favour of bringing efficiency to the push for the
development of Glosa, in its present form.  While the present product may
not be optimised, it can be efficientised and implemented without another
decade of R&D.  In terms of personal effort, I believe that release of a
Net Dictionary in both electronic and paper forms, the release of cassettes
of spoken Glosa, publication of examplar sentences demonstrating Glosa
grammar, and the eventual publication of a Glosa Grammar Book, are my top
priorities.

*   Agreed, Interglossa was an "essay" in that it was a well-thought out
idea presented to the world.  Hogben had not spent time working on the
finer points of usage, and although I don't know for fact, I suspect that
he did not beta test his language.
    'Bringing the two languages together' sounds like a tall order to me,
in that the Glosa authors started with Interglossa as their departure
point.  I suspect that they would think they "had been there, done that"
when it comes to Interglossa's mechanics.
    While I would like to see examples, also, of ways in which the original
Interglossa could be 'brought together' with Glosa, I would suggest that
pragmatically Glosa has a team disseminationg it, while Interglossa does
not.  From the perspective of a field marshal surveying the Language Reform
"battleground," I would see attempts to move Glosa back towards Interglossa
as a splitting of our forces, and a sure path to defeat.

>The dictionary still needs some work, I think we agree.

*   We all agree that the Glosa dictionary suffers from a serious lack of
proof-reading.  Also, a word-translation dictionary is often misleading in
that there are many cases where there is no direct Glosa translation of
English language words.  
    But more important is the question of a system for the addition of
technical glossaries and for the importing of proper nouns from other
languages.

*   This has been discussed much on this list, and it seems that work needs
to be done to achieve the standardised 'base vocabulary.' This was
commenced a couple of years ago when I had the Glosa 6000 dictionary scanned.
    I am working hard now to complete my attempt to fill in the gaps that
were found by Bill Patterson, when he produced a list of English language
words omitted from Glosa 6000.
    Paul Bartlett also strongly suggested that qualifying adjectives be
included for many of the translations of Glosa words to clarify their
meanings.  Electronically this causes no problem, but, in the printed
dictionary, extra words often translate into extra pages, and increased
costs.  Presently there is no actual money for recasting the printed
dictionaries, and there is limited manpower for the refining of electronic
dictionaries.
   The question of subject matter glossaries seems to me to depend on the
activities of dedicated subject-matter experts putting together word-lists
in their areas of expertise.

As I see it, consolidation will only get done when we work on it.

The basic verbs of Interglossa end in a distinctive vowel,
so that tense particles are less tempting to use
for indicating the start of a verb-phrase/predicate.
Glosa's terminal vowels carry no information.
A&C should recant on this! (Not holding my breath.)

The other thing (besides light POS marking) I wish they'd
reconsider, is to use Greek to build scientific words.
Just 2 easy fixes, actually ...

At this point in time, I agree. If a sufficient users base
grows, then these marvelous proposals can be reconsidered.
At that point, A&C could no longer dominate the language.

A word-building system would solve that problem and beyond.
Hand-picking words is OK for the Glosa-6000, but not for
the full 25,000+ vocabulary. A system would also be mnemonic.
That was inherent in the original idea, though obviously
it was not fully developed. Chemists/engineers/etc won't
use it unless it is easy to coin new words systematically;
they will just use random "international" words.

But true in Interlingua. Now there is a new dictionary ...

Indeed, has already; the machines will need to learn

Wow! ... Right now I'm looking at the EuroWordNet pages,
where they have created an "ontology" (categorization)
of common top-level concepts from several languages.

http://www.let.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/topont.htm

In their lists I see several words not present in
the Lojban basic vocabulary, or Glosa's, or even
Essential World English. This is the benefit of a
systematic analysis. Still, their biggest list
has only 1024 items. So I do think it possible
to fill in ALL essential concepts within a
very small vocabulary, such as you propose.
It is NOT easy work to do so, of course.

The word list from the Oxford Corpus is analyzed
into part-of-speech use. See:

http://www.rick.harrison.net/langlab/lab3.html

Yes, necessarily. One temptation would be to use
dreaded terminal vowels to disambiguate words;
my guess is that someday people will want to use
them for POS marking, despite A&C's intuition.
So please resist that temptation if it bites.

Indoeuropean languages are difficult in phonology and grammar.
But they have such a large population (over 50% of the world)
and so resemble each other that the IAL designers naturally
produce cleaned-up IE-clones. Easterners have such simple
languages (in phonology and grammar, NOT the writing!)
they see no need for IALs at all (exaggeration).

Though pidgin/creoles have been a great interest of mine,
there is relatively little information about them even today.
Analytic languages are in that domain; most easy to learn,
and they arise for similar reasons. Yet they are stable
(Chinese, English to a lesser extent) and powerful.

It is difficult to make something but keep it simple.
The ideal language would be of this nature.
Glosa has a chance to become such.

Hogben doesn't count? A&C tried a variation of
it, that doesn't count? Several people have
stated a preference for the old Interglossa
over Glosa, why count them?

The terminal vowels are not meaningless by
accident; either they decided to keep that option
open, or tried overloading and found it didn't work.

An alternative is to use articles and tense
particles to mark phrase boundaries. So far,
that seems to be the direction it's going.
In fact, that is the usual way with pidgins.

I just like Hogben's way a little better.
Since 99% of the good press Glosa has
gotten is due to Hogben/Bodmer, I'd be
careful not to jettison their work entirely.

    That is possible.  I have not had the opportunity to become as

    Possible.  I do not know all the history of their efforts. 
However, I did know of one IAL project in which the author was going to
have a grand total of nine (count 'em) verbs in the entire language. 
So the idea of a strictly limited set of verbs is not unique to
Interglossa.  I have never had the chance to give it a try myself.

    This is a design decision, not something Writ Large in the Nature
of the Cosmos.  As I recall, Hogben made a deliberate, conscious
design decision to retain etymological spelling in place of strict
phoneticity.  For that matter, the compilers of the Interlingua-English
Dictionary did something rather similar (although in the Gode&Blair
Interlingua Grammar there is provision for a "collateral orthography,"
which has not particularly caught on, at least on the Interlingua
mailing list).

    They simply made a different decision from Hogben and the compilers
of the IED.  In written form, at least, I personally would find Glosa
easier to read with the etymological spelling.  A few more rules could
cover the case of written-for-to-pronunciation, although I acknowledge
that the inverse would be a little more difficult.  However, with a
vocabulary of limited size, it would be less of a burden that the mess
with English.

    'Pe', which already exists, seems to do quite well.

    This would seem to me to mean that you are saying that we have no
choice but to maintain the staus quo.  Cleaning up the terminal vowel
confusion will -necessarily- mean conflict with some of the published
wordlists.  And without cleanup, I myself don't even think Glosa is
worth paying much attention to (as well as the Greek-Latin synonym
redundancies).  Similarly with optimization of the vocabulary.  I see
no way around a possible "compromise [of] the existing user base" to
at least a minimal extent if Glosa is to mature.  Unfortunate, and I
will entertain arguments to the contrary, but I suspect that some such
conflict is almost inevitable, simply because in my estimation Glosa
was "put out there" without sufficient consistency.

    Not everyone advocates "a minimal inflectional system" or part-of-
speech marking.  I for one don't.

    I agree that another decade of research and development is not
necessary.  At the risk of repeating myself, I see the need only for
the following:

1) Eliminate the terminal confusion.

2) Eliminate the Greek-Latin word pairs (in each instance, pick 
   one and discard the other).

3) Optimize the base vocabulary (and I do -not- consider Glosa 6000
   to be the "base vocabulary").

4) Enhance the "Mechanics of Glosa" with connected to text to
   demonstrate that it is simply not necessary to mark everything 
   under the sun.

5) Promote the language better (however that is to be done).

    In some cases, as previously noted, some Glosa words differ 
only by their terminal vowels.  I see no problem with this so long 
as individual words with different terminal vowels in different
publications get cleaned up.  I myself just do not see a big toot 
for overloading terminal vowels other than to be part of distinct 
words.

    Charles, to be honest, I am not aware of anyone other than yourself
stumping for part-of-speech marking in Glosa.  I guess it comes down 
tp different design features wanted in an auxlang.  Some want
characteristics like word-terminal POS marking, and some don't.

    I think that the situation may be a little of both.  Its promotion
has been relatively weak and limited, in my estimation.  On the other
hand, I simply do not consider Glosa a sufficiently mature product for
me to want to put very much energy into actually using it.

    Please note that all I said was "in Glosa."  Certainly there are
many people dealing with this, that, or the other auxlang who want
and/or like part-of-speech marking in some form or other.  But I was
resferring specifically and only to Glosa when I remarked that you
yourself are the only person I am currently aware who seems to be
advocating such specifically for Glosa.

*   Sorry to repeat my previous comments:-
 . No, the Glosa authors know they cannot copyright a language.
 . They have placed GEO copyright on their dictionaries, wordlists and
other publications.
 . Clark and Ashby have attempted to exert a 'moral right' over Glosa, in
that they have conducted considerable field research in developing the
language, and thus have released it, ultimately, as a fait accomple.
 . The authors did say that people should "play with the language", and I
believe that this condition still applies.  While the foundations of the
language are solidified by now, and though the authors do not expecr to see
serious attempts to change the basic criteria of Glosa, there is much room
for personal interpretation of the usage of the language. 
 . The authors believe the language to be in its late "beta testing" stage ..
if not a "gamma testing" one.  Thus, they do not imagine a return to the
drawing board for Glosa, at this stage of its development.
 . There are a number of changes yet needed in Glosa, some already
mentioned by 
Paul - though they are additional to the basic structure of Glosa,
extending it, rather than fundamentally changing it ...
   # creation of technical glossaries;
   # formulation of guidelines for tha addition of new terms and proper nouns;
   # clarification of the rules of sentence formation;
   # guidelines on the use of idiom and metaphor within Glosa.

    However, the Glosa authors exert a co-ordianating influence over the
process of dissemination of the language, quite apart from its design
elements.
    In general, there is room for a wider administration of Glosa's 
dissemination, and this is gradually evolving as its usage becomes
decentralised.  But yes, I have noted some reluctance on the part of the
authors to delegate authority in administration work.  For my part, I
maintain contact with people in Third World countries, and we use Glosa for
our communication.  There is hardly any discussion at this level about
language design, most of the comments being about the method of dissemination.
    I work with the authors, and am not acting as an independent Glosa-pe.
I could describe the relationship as one of "concensus".  As a 'research
assistant' I make suggestions to the authors, and conduct research in areas
that have not been covered by their work; when my suggestions do not yield
countering advice, I go ahead and implement them.

    Perhaps the cut and thrust rules of academic research are inapplicable
in the realms of Independent Scholarship.  When researchers are unpaid,
then the relationships between senior researchers and assistant researchers
are more sensetive to disharmony, with nothing to keep the group together,
beyond mutual support.

    Without making further declarations on the inter-relationships within
the Glosa research community, I would appeal to Glosa supporters , Glosa
enquirers and would-be Glosa-pe to tru the language for themselves.  Give
the language a trial, in its present, state before seeking changes - even
for the best of intellectual reasons.  It is mu present understanding that
Language Knowlege resides in the subconscious and other regions of the
brain, and not primarily in the 'consciousness centres'.  
    For this reason I would encourage enquirers on this list thus:-
 . learn by doing;
 . aim to 'think in Glosa';
 . test the language by using it to write about something you know ...
which is not too technical;
 . open-mindedly explore the idea of a language whose words primarily
represent concepts.
 . look for beauty and elegance in Glosa, and attempt to discover a 'feel'
for these qualities by using Glosa.

Saluta,
 Robin G.

Choose one (the Latin one if there's no better reason) for standalone use.  But
keep both for compound (scientific) word formation.

ASAP please.  A target date (eg 1st Jan 2000) should be set for completion --

Good mechanics is essential!!!  Can we have a *definitive* list of phrase
markers?  Never use the semicolon, it's invisible in speech.  Has anyone
considered the mechanics of AllNoun (another conlang, can't remember its URL)?

Promote it within the conlang circle yes, but I fear it's too young to venture

    By the "Mechanics of Glosa" I am referring to the lists of
paradigmatic phrases and sentences that appear in various publications,
as well as in the web pages I set up.  My only real complaint with
these lists of paradigms is that they are insufficient.

    A young child does not learn her native tongue from a grammar book. 
However, neither does she learn paradigmatic phrases free from a
context.  That context is feedback, both verbal and nonverbal, from her
elders.  Such feedback is missing in the current "Mechanics of Glosa"
approach.

    For instance, with nothing but isolated paradigmatic sentences, a
would-be learner of Glosa might get the idea that it is necessary to
mark tense (or aspect) on every verb, when it is no such thing.  If the
time referent is clearly in the past or the future, then it is simply
not necessary to keep using 'pa' and 'fu' all over the place.  Some
natlangs (such as English) are forever marking tense, but there is no
reason Glosa has to.  Similarly, it is simply not necessary to mark
every noun with 'u(n)' and 'plu' every time, such as after a
preposition, especially when number is unknown or irrelevant.

    An enhanced "Mechanics of Glosa" would bring these matters out in a
way that the isolated paradigmatic phrases and sentences do not.  Just
provide some connected text to make such things clear.

     By the way, information on AllNoun can be found at

    The protocols of dealing with "Glosa Central."  They do not
participate in online fora, and nobody seems to know -- at least, I
don't -- what their attitude to such online activity is and whether
they would try to pull a Schleyer.

    But would they try to claim copyright infringement if others
published wordlists and examples?  I still think that the best thing
Zamenhof ever did for Esperanto was to place in unequivocally in the
public domain.  He never got rich off of it.

    Zamenhof during his lifetime seemed to have remained -the- examplar
of good Esperanto usage but otherwise did not control it.  History
seems to show that attempting to exert proprietary control over an
auxlang is deadly.

    Clark & Ashby are to be commended for their work.  However, if it
is to be considered a fait accompli and not subject to further
optimization, then I think it is in trouble.

    To some extent, I think that sort of thing is what is going on
here.

    I do not think the basic structure of the language needs to be
changed.  I just think some things need some cleaning up, which I will
not tiresomely repeat here.

    As I say, I don't think it needs it.

    I have stated elsewhere (primarily on AUXLANG) that idiom should be
scrupulously AVOIDED at almost all costs in an auxlang.  Idioms are the
bane of learners and non-native users of languages.  Metaphor is a
different matter, although even that should be used with care.

    Such reluctance may be understandable, but I think it is unwise.
