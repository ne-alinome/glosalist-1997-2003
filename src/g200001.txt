Hi, Paul,
If you wish I can send you the info on how to ftp
to the site any files you wish to store there.
Just let me know and I'll email you privately
the username and password.

Since,
Jay B.

    Jay, I have to say honestly that I do not recall your message. 
However, 1) my memory is not as good as it used to be; and 2) there was
a while that I was not subscribed to Glosalist, so I might have missed
it, anyway.

    I took a hasty look, and it seem as if they have most of the
material, although I did not check for all eight files.  (See below.)

    Actually, there are two large files, the Basic Reference and the
spelling checker for MS-DOS (which might run in a DOS window under
Windows, although I have not tried it).  Altogether there are eight
files, totalling 290156 bytes as they sit on my ISP's Linux server. 
(The exact byte count might vary on a Microsoft-based server.)

    I moved them off GeoCities back when Yahoo took it over and there
was some hullaballoo about copyright issues.  I placed links to where
they sit now.  If someone will definitively take over all eight files
(I would like the spelling checker to go, too), I will place links on
my site pointing to the new site.  Whether I can change the links on
GeoCities I don't know, as I have not tried to access those link-files
in a looong time, and as best I recall I had difficulty the last time I
ever tried.

    You may send me the information.  However, I want to make it clear
that I am looking for someone who is willing to take over the
RESPONSIBILITY for the Glosa www pages and not merely provide some
space for them.  Sorry if I did not make tha sufficiently clear in the
beginning.

*    Thank You, Bill,

       This is a nice offer.

  

       I would adjust my Website to give your location, AND the Glosalist archives, in a new update .. if you and Paul can negotiate the transfer of files that would otherwise be lost.


       I am using AceFTP, and this is a very smoothe program for the job, which I was putting off, and putting off, until I had a free mind to concentrate on the 'ordeal.'  Doing the webpages has been a snip - being able to dummy them up on a floppy disk, then to transfer them all to the ISP's computer.  But, I wasn't looking forward to it.

       Once into the swing of it, I decided to do a version of the Glosa history: while the kocher, Richmond, version does not actually mention me, the one on my webpages does.

       Sadly, I have got cauught up in the whirlwind of the 'interesting times' and am closely following the Seattle WTO story: I feel that what happened is one up for the good guys.  If Glosalistas feel that there is any hope of IAL adoption - this side of the Revolution - then I will get active again.  But the hot topic is definitely the putsche from the Transnatioals attempting to take over the world: there seems little room, in their plans, for a democratic, Common Second Language for the world.

       I certainly feel that Glosa's beauty should not be lost.  What worries me is the extremely small number, who follow their interest in Glosa with writing it in prose.  Perhaps we ought to institute a special status, with special title, for anyone who writes a story of treatise of over one page, in length, using Glosa!  Zamenhof did, for Esperanto.

       Maybe "Glo'Sko-pe" would do the trick.  What does the panel think?  Sends your suggestions for the title to this List.

       Possibly, to publish stories and original non-fiction articles, an e-zine needs to be instituted.


Saluta,

  Robin Gaskell.

    Yes, I will surf these sites, and will send items to you for inclusion.
    I would like some other Glosalistas to consider writing in, or on,
Glosa for your pages also.

    What it means is that once someone else takes over the files, I
will put links to them on my web space (which are already linked to
from the old GeoCities site), and thereafter I wash my hands of them 
to have whatever life anyone else will give them (although I have
parked a zipped copy on my home machine for safekeeping).  My pages had
the approval of A&C in Richmond, and excerpt for the introductory page
all the material was theirs.  Anyone who took them over would have any
responsibility for negotiating with Richmond anything else having to do
wiht copyrighted material.

Oh man, when will people learn ... Abandon the Microsoft nazis
and get Linux today! No more viruses, cheap and easy updates
under your control, multiple user logins on the same machine
for family use. Besides much higher performance in every sense.
Run your own web/mail servers, post 10gb of data if you want. Etc.

&   A Good Effort, Marcel,

    You demonstrate possibly the main aspect of learning Glosa: using it. 

    And you do so very well.  By trying to express your-self using Glosa, you will feel the words locate themselves with best fit.  This feeling grows with practice.

    Do you have trouble thinking in German, and then, thinking in Glosa?


    Regarding re-locating existing Web-pages in your own Web-site, this action is very logical: if you do not translate this information into German, who will do it?  When you translate the pages from Richmond, U.K.  

- possibly from Paul Bartlett's Website - please give recognition to the authors.  

    If you use items from my Web-site, possibly you will include a note about me, but only for reasons of history.

    Do you have the feeling that inclusion of "Seminar #1" will help future Glosa students in Germany?

  [N.B. The languge of Linguistics is not fully worked out for Glosa, but Seminar #1 should translate readily into German .. if you think it fits in a Web-page.]

_A first Seminar on Glosa____________________________R. Gaskell Sept,1995_
               (With apologies, in English)
WORDS
        Words in Glosa represent concepts, and are really `concept/words.'
They represent ideas, but, depending on their position in the sentence,
and their relationships to other words, they may represent that idea in its
solid form (noun), active form (verb), or as a modifier of another idea
(adjective, adverb).

        The words do not change for reasons of grammar (system for getting
understanding from words): this means that words can be used, within
reason, as any part of speech, but have no letters added to indicate this
useage (no Part-of-Speech markers); also, the words which act as verbs,
`verbs', have no endings added to them (no inflections) to give added
understanding of how, or when, the action is taken.

        The order of the words (syntax) gives us the meaning in Glosa; the
language can be described as having `syntax-based grammar.'

PHRASES
        The phrase (small group of words) is the basic unit of sentence
construction in Glosa.  A small group of words might include a thing and
some description of it (noun phrase), or the group might include an action
and some modifications to this action (verb phrase).  A small group of
words at the start of a Glosa sentence might qualify the action of the
sentence (adverbial phrase).

        Within each phrase, each word is modified by the one before it, and
there is a gradual increase in importance of the words, with the main
concept/word (`noun' or `verb') as the last word of the phrase.
                e.g.  the three fast, loud red cars                  NP
                      plu tri celero fo-sono rubi vagona

                e.g.  were quickly end excitedly talking loudly      VP
                      pa du celero e excita fo-sono dice

                e.g.  while running     (relates to  --->  verb)     AdvP
                      tem kursi

        In speech, phrases are said as one group, often with a raising then
lowering of intonation (pitch), from start to finish; in written form, if
it seems necessary for the understanding of meaning, the start and finish
of phrases, is indicated using punctuation (commas).

CLAUSES
        A clause is a larger group of words containing two (NP + VP) or
more phrases, and such a simple two or three phrase clause can make up the
whole sentence (major clause).  However, a clause - which always includes
at least one verb phrase - might add meaning to the action of the
sentence (Adverbial Clause), might give more description to one of the
things in a sentence (Adjectival Clause), or it could be a group of words,
including a `verb,' used in the place that you would normally find a noun
phrase (Noun Clause).

      e.g.  The boy arrived.              U ju-an pa ariva.            MC

      e.g.  The girl went home.           U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi.     MC

      e.g.  The man will eat the meal.    Un andra fu vora u vora.     MC

      e.g.  She spoke so loudly that she was heard.
            Fe pa ta sono dice ke fe pa gene ge-audi.                AdvC
                          ~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

      e.g.  The girl went home after she had eaten a good meal.
            U ju-fe pa ki a fe domi, po fe pra vora u boni vora.     AdvC
                       ~~   <---     ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The boy, who was fat and badly dressed, arrived.
            U ju-an; qi pa es paki e mali ge-vesti, pa ariva.        AdjC
              ~~~~~ <-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  I like to get away from the house.
                  (getting)
            Mi amo gene ab u domi.                                     NC
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
      e.g.  The farmer hoped that it would rain.
            Un agri-pe pa spera: ke id sio pluvi.                      NC
                       ~~~(V)~~  ~~~~(O)~~~~~~~~

SEQUENCE IN A CLAUSE
        The normal sequence in Glosa is the same as in English:-
 Main Clause =   noun phrase    -    verb phrase     -    noun phrase
                  (SUBJECT)            (VERB)              (OBJECT)
            Doer of the action    Action being done    Thing acted upon
           e.g.     He                 posts               a letter.
                    An                 posta               u grama.

        There are three main variations to this: clauses with no object
(intransitive verb); clauses where, for reasons of style, the speaker,
or writer, wishes to emphasise the object by placing it first (Passive
Voice); and Noun Clauses which have no subject (infinitive verb).
           e.g.    She (NP)    sang. (VP)                 Fe pa kanta.
                 (SUBJECT)    (VERB)

           e.g.   The letter       was posted        by the man.
                   U grama      pa gene ge-posta     ex un andra.
                               (did get got-post)
                   (OBJECT)         (VERB)                (SUBJECT)

           e.g.                  - running (=to run)     on wet grass
                                    kursi              epi ge-hidra gra
                                    (VERB)                 (OBJECT)

        Because its grammar depends on the word order, Glosa works best if
we keep to the normal (S-V-O) structure in clauses.  In poetry and fiction,
however, the stylistic variations are necessary.

FUNCTION WORDS
        These are the small words that are not concept/words, but which
join these words together (conjunctions), lead us into a phrase or clause
(prepositions), create negatives, introduce questions, or modify the timing
of an action when placed before a `verb' (tense particles).  There are also
the small words placed before `nouns' to tell us that they are things, and
how many, or how much, of them there are (determinants).
        Joining words:  e, sed, pluso, alo, ni

        Prepositions: tem, a, ex, de, anti, seqe, po, pre, vice, krom ....

        Negatives: ne, nuli, no-, ni ... ni, nuli-

        Questions: Qe, qestio, qod, qo-

        Tense particles: pa, fu, du, nu, pra, sio, ge-, gene

        Before `nouns': u, plu, plura, uno, vario, poli, oligo, u mero de
         (determinant)

SENTENCES
        Putting all the above together, in Glosa, as in English, sentences
can be made up of various combinations of phrases and clauses - as long as
the Subject-Verb-Object rule is observed.  In Glosa, also, there is the
added requirement that words in phrases follow the rule of increasing
importance, with the main concept/word last.

        If the sentence is made up of phrases only, there is a single
`verb', and the sentence is described as a Major Clause.  If there are two
or more `verbs', then the `verb' describing the main action forms the Main
Clause, and the other clauses (NC, AdvC, AdjC) are called Subordinate
Clauses.  The whole sentence can, however, still be called the Major
Clause.
        The secret of good sentence formation is in using well-formed
phrases to make up the sentences and their constituent clauses.

PRECEDENCE IN PHRASES
RULE: In a phrase, a word is modified by the word in front of it (its
        precedent.)
RULE: In a normal sentence (Major Clause), there is a tendency for the
        first noun phrase (SUBJECT) to modify the verb phrase (VERB), and
        then, for the verb phrase to modify the second noun phrase (OBJECT).
RULE: A modifying clause (Adjectival or Adverbial) follows directly after
        the concept/word that it modifies; this structure is indicated
        by the placing of a semi-colon (;) or possibly a colon (:) before
        the new clause.

 In a noun phrase, the sequence is:-

           determinant  -  number  -  quantity  -  modifier(s)  -  noun

        e.g. plu tri no-ge-numera, fo sono, no-puri ju-an
             the three uncounted, shouting, dirty boys

           Note.  The concept/word used as a noun is the only element of
              a noun phrase that is essential.

 In a verb phrase, the sequence is:-
                                                    |   verb
  negative - tense - modifier(s) - auxiliary verb - |      OR
 particle                                           | verboid + amplifier

                     e.g. ne pa hedo, no-soni tenta | kursi
                                                    | ki ana

                       did not happily, quietly try | to run
                                                    | to go up

           Note, again.  The concept/word used as a verb is the only
               element of a verb phrase that is essential.

<excerpt><smaller>Hello Robin!

Thank you for your interesting observations    .....    feel that there
is enough to learn without having to overcome contradictions and
inconsistencies - that was my reaction anyway. 

</smaller></excerpt>** Hi David,

    The main problem, for me, with these base-level annoyances in the
Glosa lists, is that I do not have a printing press, and that while
refining these matters - to "standardise" Glosa - I had a computer
wipe-out with a virus.

It was complicated, and I was off the Net for a month, which was enough
to take the impetus away from the Glosalist, whose members were working
on it.

    So, For the many non-Networked Glosa-pe printed paper copies of the
dictionaries is all they have.  Howevber, for the Netted Glosa-pe, we can
change the spelling and remove unwanted synonyms, but this was taking a
long while to reach concensus. 

    Also, we had the other problem of 'copyright' and the authors'
dominance and moral suasion.  But, for financial reasons, Clark and Ashby
while joining the Internet, were not active on it, and did not join the
Glosalist discussions.

    So, I was creating what could almost be seen as a parallel
administration of Glosa, and I needed to maintain good connections with
the authors at the same time.  That was just the way it was.

    Now, however, Glosa's basic plan is just as good as it ever was, but
the authors are not able to maintain as active a role as they had.  So, I
could exert a stronger influence in the works: I could buy a laser
printer, so that dictionaries I print will not run when wet (as
bubble-jet does); and I could complete the "Glosa 2500 Learner's
Dictionary" that was nearly ready when I got virussed: also I could
become much more active in the creation of learning materials, such as
cassettes and instruction books.  But ....

    Just when I started bouncing back from the wipe-out, other ..
non-linguistic .. problems arose on the horizon.  Had there been no worry
about the survival of basic Democracy, I would have happily put all of my
effort into getting Glosa off the ground.

    I am not sure how much you know about the MAI, G7 or WTO, but there
really was good reason for all of those people moving into Seattle to
alert the world to its perilously dangerous situation.  I an afraid that
political forces are far stronger than those of language reform, and that
we will probably see Capitalism collapse - as cataclysmically as did
Russian Socialism - before we see world leaders decide to act on the IAL
hypothesis.  I am working on the question of which system follows
Capitalism when it has been discredited.



<excerpt><smaller>  I accept your point regarding creativity (where would
humanity be without it?) and if the language should ever become accepted
and used as an IAL then change, innovation, creativity should follow
naturally (as happens with languages anyway). 

</smaller></excerpt>**   The bad news is that there isn't much spare
creativity about: most creatives are busy exploiting their imaginations
as song-writers, pop musicians, advertising copy-writers, hack
journalists, novel-writers, etc.

     Very few are employing their creative abilities altruistically to
prevent our civilisation from falling into the abyss.  In a round-about
way, I am saying that I have been distracted, by events, from applying
myself single-mindedly to the success of the IAL.


<excerpt><smaller>  Whilst Glosa is in its infancy (with regard to
becoming known and accepted) I do believe that it should be made as
simple as possible and presented in such a way that its functionality
cannot be criticised. 

</smaller></excerpt>**   And it is obvious, as well.  The authors did
simplify Hogben's pattern considerably, and Glosa is now recognised as
the Planned Language with th most simplified structure.  But, on
functionality, the authors misjudged the need for regularity on the part
of the majority of mankind.  They did not standardise the dictionary
spellings; but, for reasons of cost, kept printing the same wordlists ..
even though the lack of standardisation was reported, to them, as being
irksome to many learners.


<excerpt><smaller>  Faulty dictionaries, contradictory word endings, more
than one word to represent a definitive idea (in the basic 1000 words at
least) allows areas for criticism which could be avoided without too much
trouble.   It is easy to criticize of course but there are other areas of
concern to me.   Firstly I don't really understand why punctuation needed
to be changed from the conventional (when writing Glosa as I did some
five years ago I found myself keeping to conventional punctuation - and
only used colons and semi-colons where I would normally have done when
writing English.

</smaller></excerpt>**    This is a tricky one.  However, I suspect that
there is such a thing as a "Grammar of Punctuatuion."  It is possible,
that, as evolved as it is, an also as conventionalised as it is, English
punctuation might be right for the way English works, but not necessarily
for the ways some other languages work.

      I tried to understand what Ron Clark was doing, when he introduced
specialised punctuation rules for Glosa, and I try to apply them .. to
see if they are 'funcional.'  When I 'think in Glosa' I use the Ronald
Clark system of punctuation - more or less; and, when I think in English,
i tend to use a standardised version of English punctuation.  And I note
that when I give Glosa and English versions of the same sentence, they
might be differently punctuated.

      As an explanation, not an excuse, I would mention that Glosa,
having a 

syntax-based grammar with uninflected words, means that sometimes the
puntuation needs to do some of the grammatical work: I liken it to the
use of a shoehorn - to make sure that things go into the right place, IE
are understood by the reader to articulate in the way intended by the
writer.  Then again, in spoken Glosa, vocal inflection gives us the
internal structure of the sentence, much as punctuation does in written
text.  So, in Glosa, I might say that good punctuation is more important
than it is in English.  There probably is a clear relationship between
written punctuation and the vocal inflection that it is used to indicate.
 You are having trouble with the fact that Glosa and English have a
different set of ground-rules to indicate this relationship.

      Although Ron did not express it as functionally as I do, Glosa
phrases are 'flagged' with a starting comma, and Glosa Clauses are
'flagged' with a starting semi-colon.  This is not a hard and fast rule,
so that semi-colons can be elided to commas; and commas can be elided
out.  However, where it seems necessary to mark the sentence structure
for reasons of clarity - and with Glosa's simplified form, this may
become necessary - then the mechanism, to do so, exists.

      Most English-speakers claim that an excess of semi-colons makes a
sentence look ugly.  And this may be so.  But were the language taught
functionally, then learners would happily use the "start of clause" mark,
so that the reader had no trouble in understanding the structure of his
sentence.


EG  Fe pa ki a fe domi; qi habe loka to u buta de u via.


   She went (to her) home, (which is) located at the end of the road.


    Fe pa ki domi; loka to u buta de u via.


In Glosa the same functional punctuation, the semi-colon, is used
whether, or not, there is elision.  While I could have 'puristically'
placed a comma after LOKA to indicate the start of a subsidiary phrase,
this structure was obvious, and I elided the comma.

    Had Ron Clark thought differently, he mght have invented unique
punctuation marks for Glosa - to avoid confusion with the established
usages for the traditional marks of English.

    Since having thought about the 'function' of punctuation, as it
applies to Glosa, I have loostened up my own markings in normal English
.. especially on the Net, EG

   raining ^cats and dogs^

   well .. only at Christmas

   he *really* got angry

   then, I knew ... it was the flat battery

   couldn't move; but, when it growled


<excerpt><smaller>   Also I found it rather annoying when reading Plu
Glosa Nota to come across words that I couldn't fathom the meaning of
which didn't appear in the dictionaries.    Subsequently advice was given
to use an Italian dictionary to supplement Glosa vocabulary - do you
think that is sound advice - what are the alternatives with regard to
expanding the vocabularly? 

</smaller></excerpt>**   Agreed it was a bit silly, however I use mainly
the Latin dictionary for word divination and creation, and on rare
occasions I consult the Greek one.

     Italian is relevant to pronunciation: borrow a cassette of spoken
Italian, and you hear Glosa's sounds.


<excerpt><smaller>   Also what do you think about the practice of naming
days and months by numbers?   Is it not just a bit too 'clinical' - too
detached?  (I'm having difficulty in expressing conveying what I mean
here).   Days and months tend to have recognisably internationalised
names and are usually learned without too much difficulty - personally I
know I would have found it easier and quicker to have learned names
rather than to have tried to work out which day di sixa represented or
which month is meno seti.   The dictionaries do give some names but not
all. 

</smaller></excerpt>**   While it might be more human to have folksy
names for days and months, it is probably more 'ecumenical' to
standardise the calendar mathematically, at least for beginners; once
people have moved up to a dictionary with synonyms, they then should have
no problem in being understood using either "Januari" or "Mo 1".


<excerpt><smaller>  I suppose that my experience with Esperanto showed me
the advantages of a well controlled language although this too can be
problematical if "conservatives" refuse to budge when innovation is
called for - and I am referring to the reluctance to accept change
concerning  the accented letters which  many Esperantists wanted to
abolish so as to make the language more user friendly, particularly  with
regard to the computer.

</smaller></excerpt>**   Yes, we have some conservatism in Glosa too: as
Esperantists think accent marks are OK, some, in Glosa, think variable
spellings are OK.  But full standardisation is needed for any language
that is intended for use within all cultures!  This was, originally to
have been achieved by the Glosalist.

<excerpt>  

<smaller>Yes, I am still interested in the Glosa social invention - I am
a "one world" person who does not consider that he has a country - the
absolute opposite of a patriot/nationalist.   Part of my
political/economic/social outlook embraces the need for an IAL (or as I
mentioned before any language that may be universally acceptable).  

</smaller></excerpt>**   Interesting themes here: a community-based
society probably is more likely to be 'patriotic' than 'globalised'.  And
centralisation of power and wealth are proving to be major evils of this
Later Phase of Capitalism.  So, does Interlingualism favour the
centralisation of power, or does it maintain the strength of community?


<excerpt><smaller> At the moment my wife and I are struggling to learn
some Spanish -and it is because of this (added to some disillusion with
Glosa for reasons stated)  that I put Glosa on the back burner for a
while.   We go down to Spain for a camping holiday during Feb & March so
for that period I will not be available.   This email was started a few
days ago but then put aside whilst I endeavoured to download your
seminars - I could't transfer them to 'word' - had to 'phone my son who
knows about these things  - anyway to cut the story short I got at them
through 'notepad' this morning but I will not  have time to digest them
properly before going away so will print them off and take them  with
me.

</smaller></excerpt>** Happy travelling in Spain, and success with the
language.  Spanish is the major second language in the southern states of
the USA.  I have tended to keep in ASCII, where possible; perhaps I will
need to adopt a newer w.p. convention.

<excerpt>Wordpad is much better than Notepad.

  

<smaller>I see with interest that you are a jazz enthusiast and I am also
(where trad is concerned).   Unfortunately I do not have your gift of
being able to play a musical instrument and my singing (in or out of the
bath) brings on an amused smile from my wife.   We do manage to  get away
to a few jazz weekends during the year and we regularly attend the
monthly jazz session at the quaintly named venue in Norwich called  the
'Norfolk Dumpling' .   Unfortunately we will miss the next three sessions
two of which are good continental bands.      I look forward to hearing
from you.

Saluta.   

</smaller></excerpt>**   It's more of a fading memory these days.  When
Peace returns, I will retire, and probably start playing again.


Saluta

  Robin Gaskell
