*  Mi Plu Karo Amika,
   I write in English to be quick; I should work harder to do it in Glosa.
   I think that you have misunderstood Charles' intention.
   As I remember the discussion with Charles on the idea of 'perfecting'
Glosa by revising it to a much better version - probably with a different
name - refers to a language to which he has given the working title of,
"Glosa 3."
   So, I interpret Charles' comments, about a possible schism, as being a
schism between Glosa 2 (normal Clark/Ashby Glosa) and Glosa 3 (an ammended
Glosa derivative, as yet to be specified or formed).
   I think this is what Charles implied.
   I am almost certain that he was not suggesting anyone hark back to Glosa
1 (Hogben's Interglossa), and nor was he seeing Glosa 2 (C/A Glosa) as the
improved breakaway.

   This whole Glosa 1 - 3 nomenclature worries me, because to project Glosa
(1992 Version) backwards to dub Interglossa (Hogben, 1943) as _Glosa 1_ is
historical nonsense.  A number of members of Conlang persisted in calling
Glosa "Glossa".  And for people who are pedantic on spellings, I found such
behaviour perverse.
   If anyone must talk about an as yet unformed derivative of current
Glosa, I would suggest that they gave it, the concept, a specific name such
as "N-M Glosa", for 'New Millenium Glosa.'

   And for sure, if a new criterion set was prepared for a language that
was radically better than, or rather different from, current Glosa, which I
might call "Glosa (1992 Ver.)", then such an initiative from within what
might loosely be called the Glosa Movement, would definitely cause a split
in its ranks.
   As it so happens, If I sat down and thought hard, I might come up with a
slightly varied criterion list for Glosa, But I would not push such
possible changes as an agenda: instead, I would use some of the new ideas
in my Glosa writing, in the thought that if they had value, they might
catch on.

*  One of my worries is this keeping Glosa alive by using it.
   I, for one, am not doing enough of it.
   Sid is definitely doing his bit.  Though he and I might differ on points
of usage, our differences are more like differences over English language
usage, than the cause of splitting Glosa into two versions.
   But many more of the Glosa Group should be writing using it.
   Wendy should be receiving an overflow mail of potential items for Plu
Glosa Nota.  We can use the vocabulary as it is: changing spellings is
purely a matter of editing.  The thingwhich takes much more effort is to
get our syntax right.  and even before the lexicon is set inconcrete, we
can start practising word order and Glosa 
constructions.
   Only when we have a reasonably consistent usage of Glosa can we say the
language lives.  I have been caught up, lately, in trying to do something
about the present Australian drought - the country is drier than at any
time since weather records began.
   --> I should compile my lexicon of Glosa words that are drought related,
possibly adding a few neologisms in the process, and then should tell the
yarn in Glosa for PGN readers.

   What stories do other Glosa-pe have running through your heads, at
present: tell the stories in Glosa .. enrich the language by "testing" it
in areas where it may not have been used before.

>she feels her language should be like... 
*  As I was saying, it is a matter of submitting our Glosa usage to Wendy -
preferably in PGN usable articles - rather than our waiting for her to keep
producing example of good Glosa.  Without feeback, we will never know ifwe
are using the language acceptably, or not.
   And, for me, acceptable usage has occurred when most Glosa-pe understand
the writer's intention, and can say they know what he means.

   So, that means Glosa is a language of empathy: people should have a
mental picture of the listener/reader in front of them, when they speak 

It's like

Mi Karo Robin,
Well, it sure is good to hear back
from you!
As I said in my previous post,
I think that we don't need an
new-Glosa, the old Glosa
may need tweaking and working out
but so does English on a daily basis.
Through use... nonne?

The problem with Glosa is that
one may not feel up to getting
up and running with it because
as I understand it the language
is the property of Wendy. This
is fine and whatever Wendy wants
with her language should be
respected. If anyone wants to
come up with changes to the
language they should call it
something entirely different,
and come up with some
different criteria for its
construction. As to my
misunderstanding Charles,
well, what can I say, I stopped
trying, someone with as filthy
a mouth as he I'm not willing
to deal with any longer, as the
saying goes oppose the devil
and he will flee from you...
:-)))
Since,
Jay B.

P.S. I hope your efforts in
dealing with the drought are
successful, as always, Robin,
w/ all my best wishes for you!

Subject: [glosalist] How Many Glosas?
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 7 Nov 2002 09:58:51 EST

Dear Colleagues,

I am a new Glosa user, and I am not a linguist or language builder - I have 
far too much trouble writing well in English to consider myself other than an 
imperfect  language user.  As a result, I think I have a different 
perspective on Glosa from some of the discussion on the list.  

For me it does not matter whether Glosa is perfect or fine tuned if no one 
uses it.  We have some discussion on this list in Glosa, we have a newsletter 
from time to time, and not much more.  If I wrote a book in Glosa (or if any 
other member of this list did so), who would buy and read it?  Glosa poorly 
constructed but used is far more relevant than Glosa perfectly constructed 
and unused.  

If I am going to go to the trouble of learning and using a language I want it 
to be stable.  The rules of French grammar or Spanish grammar do not change 
every month - but if Glosa had followed all of the excursions I have seen on 
this list, our change rate would be at least once a month.  If I learn Glosa, 
or Glosa 2, or whatever it is we are using, and the handful of people on the 
list decide that they want to use Glosa 3, or New Millennium, or whatever, 
then we all either have to relearn or we have to accept that we are becoming 
the ever more perfect members of an ever decreasing herd.  That is perhaps a 
fine thing if the objective is perfection of a hobby - it is a horrible thing 
if the intent is to communicate with a larger and larger sphere of people.

Constant change is even more difficult if we intend to ever publish a body of 
literature in Glosa, in my mind an absolute requirement for growth in the 
number of users.  I asked this question earlier, and someone noted that they 
could read something that had been written in Glosa years before.  That is 
the cost of the language being stable - and whether or not you like Wendy 
"owning" the language, that is the very great benefit of it.  If Glosa is 
going to change routinely there is no reason for me, or any other author, to 
write in it - half of the purpose of publishing books and articles is to 
ensure the continuity of knowledge.  If 10 years from now people cannot read 
what I have written because Glosa is Glosa 17, we will have missed the point. 
  

I think debate about the future evolution of Glosa is a good thing.  I think 
arguing about how best to express grammatical forms is wonderful.  But I 
wonder why I do not see debate about how best to structure courses in basic 
Glosa, what the content for an equivalent to the 10 lesson Esperanto course 
should be and how to recruit tutors to deliver it, about how to develop and 
encourage more publications in Glosa, about how to recognize Glosa 
proficiency - in short about how to grow the community of users so that we 
will have enough people to make all the inward looking arguments worthwhile 
and significant?

I have proposed a Glosa introductory course for my University's Continuing 
Professional Development and Personnel Enrichment Program (our continuing 
education unit community outreach program).  We may even look at doing it 
online.  So who has a good idea about what I should teach and how to get 
students into the program?

And has anyone ever wondered why we use an emblem that is a marketing and 
logo design nightmare to sell our language?  At least the Esperantists have a 
simple green star ... and an easily recognizable flag ...

From: Tom Croft <tom{at}code-demon.net>

I'm very new to glosa---I like what (little) I know of the langauge,
but a few things occurred to me (unstructured babble commences):

If the goal is to skim internationality from common languages,
surely `helo' is a better greeting than `ave'..?  Ave gets the piss
taken out of it in Asterix IIRC (which I do, a small point, I know)

Artificial language `lojban' dispenses with uppercase letters (a
most elegant move!), and while glosa is targetted at europeans I
presume (who are already aquainted with uppercase and such), that
would be a good change to the language in my humble, uneducated,
opinion.

I agree that major changes are probably undesirable; if any are to be
made, they must be made before the tutorials are written ;-).  Language
does of course change (Marlowe can be great, but he's fucking
impossible to read in any original form without translating
constantly), but yes, I agree the literature of last decade must
remain comprehensible!

The glosa symbol I also thought ridiculous.  How about a red triangle?
It's easy, and it can be asciified thusly: [/\]

The main things that repelled me from esperanto:

1: There were suffixes for: male, unspecified-gender and female.  The
   default form of words was probably male but I was unsure about what
   constituted best practice.
2: There was no list of absolute minimum vocabulary, such as glosa
   mil.  The closest I could find was a vocab list for GCSE
   (high-school-level (16 y/o) exams in Britain).

The main things that attracted me to glosa:

1: A pair of dictionaries in a well-described text-based format so I
   could hack together a basic word-lookup tool.  My esperanto equivalent
   is *much* cruder.
2: It's a piece of piss to read with a dictionary programme; I learnt
   the basics from a big list of translated sentences about `she is going
   to town' etc.  This was much easier than the intellectual effort
   required to read a tutorial.

On a more negative note, I was put off considerably by the connection
to latin.  That word evokes fear in people!  I would suggest replacing
it with "common european word roots" wherever possible!

I never used the esperanto interactive tutorials (OK, so I did, but
not the interactive element); I would welcome friendly glosa intro
material, of course, but for my own learning, I'd rather have my
dictionary-grepper and a translated fairy-tale (If anyone wants to
write/translate fairy tales or similar literature, I'd love it!).

paci, Tom

agree about the capitals and wrote as much some time ago - i tend to leave 
them out in glosa, some europeanophiles are not happy but hindi for instance 
does without them happily. i am working on the assumption that the glosa rule 
is no caps but they can be used if required and in any way that people  want
i did toy with making a sort of tutorial whereby there was a story and each 
sentence's grammar, vocab etc was explained. however the attitude to grammar 
was rather confused
at the moment i am putting forward an atheist point of view to balance things 
up and will look at the non-religeous  sides of for instance Christ which i 
find exteremely sensible also the hindu chapter
i might use it to introduce glosa

   And, for me, the more perspective from which Glosa is viewed, the better.
   BTW, Walter from which culture/language_base do you come; you are doing
a lot better with English than many of those who have had the benefit of it
throughout their entire education.

*  This is a legitimate criticism.  There ought to be much more reporting
of items written in Glosa; and I am pleased to see, of late, that Marcel
has been able to add a Glosa version of St Mark's gospel and a
Glosa_original Science Fiction story to his website!
   This is, I'd say, the cutting edge of Glosa.
   I have invited people to write more children's stories in Glosa, but
have had no takers yet; I will have to dust off the children's stories and
start adding titles, myself.  Needless to say, I ought to update (edit) the
original three on my website.

BUT, many would, without any prior training in Glosa, be able to get the
general understanding of it from their knowlege of the Classical languages,
and from the consistency of the ^plain vanilla^ syntax within the writing.
    [I have invented  ^ ..... ^  to indicate metaphoric or idiomatic usage:
the general term to describe such usage is 'non-literal language'; all
languages use this sort of thing, and there should be a mechanism whereby
it can be used in Glosa, also.]

felt it necessary to visit Paris at least every six months, to keep his
usage current, and to ensure that what he was teaching was up to date;
Glosa - in its usage and vocabulary - was basicaly "set" in 1992, with the
publication of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary.

   The piece I wrote in respose to the mention of numbers .. and my
invention of the distinguishing name 'New Millenium Glosa' .. was to
criticise such a trend towards schism, and to introduce the analogy of
computer games, which are always coming out with new versions - something
to be avoided in a Planned Language.

of literature in Glosa, in my mind an absolute requirement for growth in
the number of users. 
*  The phrase "set in cement" keeps cropping up in my mind, and I keep
trying to suppress it.
   However, 'linguistic drift' does occur in all languages, and Glosa will
be no different; but, a language proposed to standardise global
intercommunication will need - after its worldwide adoption - some form of
regulatory control.  In a similar way to the method the French use - having
an official body that rules on usage - Glosa, if it is installed as the
International Auxilliary Language, will also need some degree of regulation.

>    I asked this question earlier, and someone noted that they 
>could read something that had been written in Glosa years before.  
*  This is basically true - othewise I could not get away with leaving the
children's stories, written in the early nineties, on my website.
   The basic criteria for Glosa have not changed from its inception, though
there has been some tweaking, such as the addition of a mechanism for using
"Passive Voice".  
   Ron Clark's dictum, "a word is modified by its precedent," is still
true, but the trick is in the interpretation of this 'rule'; and, the
'syntax-based grammar' under which Glosa operates, is derived from this
original dictum.

>    That is 
>the cost of the language being stable - and whether or not you like Wendy
"owning" the language, that is the very great benefit of it.
*  Were Wendy to demonstrate the power of her "ownership," and make
authoritative rulings on the usage and forward direction of Glosa, I would
probaly feel a little less unasy: her status in the Glosa heirarchy is
reminiscent of that of the Queen in Australia's.  The Queen is titular head
(and owner) of Australia, but plays no part in the running of the place.
   If Wendy was answering your comments, now, she would be seen to be
exerting the rights of an "owner."  The fact that she is not on the Net,
and that life, in general, makes it difficult for her to participate in the
day-to-day running of Glosa, suggests the need for something like an
Esperanto-style "academy" to watch over the development of the language.

>    If Glosa is 
>going to change routinely there is no reason for me, or any other author,
to write in it - half of the purpose of publishing books and articles is to
ensure the continuity of knowledge.  If 10 years from now people cannot
read what I have written because Glosa is Glosa 17, we will have missed the
point. 
>
*  When I fist met Ron Clark in 1977, the "Glossa" effort was definitely on
the "R" of its R&D; now we are much more into the "D" end of Glosa's R&D
spectrum, but not ^out of the woods^ of Research and Development altogether.
   Some see the need for a rock-solid lexicon as the necessary foundation
stone for the language.  I believe that Glosa-pe should be advancing on all
fronts; and, using the language within various genres is definitely part of
this "Development" phase - or, as we now say, 'Beta-testing.'  Does it work
effectively to convey all manner of information?  I "tested" Glosa, in the
early stages, on children's stories, to check out Glosa's effectiveness in
the 'affective' area: could I get across the feeling behind Cinderella's
mother's admonition that her daughter NOT venture into the woods; could I
convey the bears' desolation when their little visitor fled from them; how
heartbroken was Little Bear when he found his chair broken?
   So, is Glosa still a 'work in progress'?
   To some extent, I fear so.
   But, what is written in Glosa, to-day, will be quite clearly understood
by Glosa speakers of twenty years hence - though considered  a little
quaint, I suspect.
   
>I think debate about the future evolution of Glosa is a good thing.  I
think arguing about how best to express grammatical forms is wonderful.
But I wonder why I do not see debate about how best to structure courses in
basic Glosa, what the content for an equivalent to the 10 lesson Esperanto
course should be and how to recruit tutors to deliver it, about how to
develop and encourage more publications in Glosa, about how to recognize
Glosa proficiency - in short about how to grow the community of users so
that we will have enough people to make all the inward looking arguments
worthwhile and significant?
>
*  These questions definitely ^hit the nail on the head^ ... or on the thumb.
   The suggestion is that training and accreditation methods be developed;
the criticism is that they are not.
   We could do a lot worse than go through the historical _Step by Step in
Esperanto_ by Montagu C. Butler, and produce a Glosa version of it.  Such a
product would look something like a half-century later's update of Hogben's
_Interglossa_.
   Now that we are solidly into the electronic phase of our civilisation's
development, I feel that something that could come out with colour
illustrations, possibly with some "Flash" animations - and with the
benefits of hypertext links - might be made available on CD.
   This is not to say that hardcopy versions of Glosa instruction,
preferably in colour, but even some in stark B&W, would not do the job.
[BTW I have never used a double negative in Glosa; I wonder if it works?]
[[I saw a COLOUR lazer printer advertised in a computer magazine,
yesterday; I did not look at the price - but I could.]]
   While Ron Clark's _18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa_ is GEO copyrighted, and
is of extreme historical significance, it is far from the last word in
pedogological science.  With suitable will, we can do a lot better; and,
with a training plan, we could do even better, still.

>I have proposed a Glosa introductory course for my University's Continuing
Professional Development and Personnel Enrichment Program (our continuing
education unit community outreach program).  We may even look at doing it
online.  So who has a good idea about what I should teach and how to get
students into the program?
>
*  There are almost too many good questions, here; but, Walter, you are to
be congratulated for asking them all.
   Every good language course has a curriculum: I even suspect that
Esperanto has one.  By looking at the list of educational objectives in
such a curriculum, you should find a suitable list of Glosa learning
outcomes.  
   Would all members of the List please hunt through their archives, or
consult their local education authorities, so we can pool our information
on the Glosalist - and thus derive a suitable Glosa curriculum for Walter.

   In terms of the gearing of a 'continuing education' course in Glosa, I
am not sure who the advertising should be aimed at.  We cannot say that
Glosa is the successor to Esperanto: this is not currently a fact.  Printed
(or computer referenced) information on a "Learning Vocabulary", Glosa's
Rules of Grammar, and sectional vocabularies would probably be the place to
start.  But also, models of well-formed Glosa sentences, with explanatory
information, plus easy-reading examples of Glosa prose, would also be very
worthwhile.
   But this all begs the question of Course design.
   I'd go for action, and possibly excitement, every time.  We need to stir
the verbs - and stir the blood, in the same process.
   While 'the cat sitting on the mat' is passe, and somewhat boring, >cats
being chased by yelping dogs< gets some movement into the verbs, and allows
for delicious adjectives that get the emotions going.
   While most courses start with the somewhat passive tourist ogling
railway stations, busses and places of interest, I feel that Glosa-pe and
'citicens of the World' want a bit more action.  Perhaps a traffic scene,
with near misses, bustling pedestrians and shouting cops, would get
learners straight into 'thinking in Glosa' rather than treating the
learning of Glosa as a translation exercise.
   However, that being said, a study of the demographics of those wising to
take on 'further education' might turn up a wide range of motivations.
Some would respond to the challenge of learning a different language,
others might appreciate the possibility of acquiring the future global
second language, and some could see the connection between a language with
syntax-based grammar and the demands of computer Meta-languages.  There are
a number of good reasons for learning Glosa, not the least of which is that
most Glosa-pe are altruists.  However, I would add that the Internet, as a
global means of communication is, as yet, incomplete: the wires are twisted
together; the carrier software is installed; but the 'pinkware' through
which minds inter-communicate is still absent, and the "language problem"
has only been expressed at a higher level.
   So, what is the missing link in Global communication?  The language that
all can use and understand .. easily!
   To me the prime question is: why is a sentence?
   The answer for me is that we relate to one another by telling stories,
and the smallest components of these stories are sentences.
   Thus each sentence is a small story, with actors, victims and actions,
or Actor-Action-Victim .. and usually told in that order (S-V-O).  So, I'd
imagine an instructional schema that helped people build up sentences,
starting with small, uncomplicated ones, and building via the
sophistication of more complex phrases, up to the use of fully formed
clauses within sentences.  This pedogological aim would, of course, be
interwoven with the cultural, thematic material.  Hence the idea of
starting with an aspect of life that is almost automatic, and capable of
being dealt with in short sentences, like walking in traffic.  Actual
shopping, for example, requires a higher level of language, with
interaction between the buyer and the shop-keeper - hence it would come
later in the course.
   Because Glosa does not represent an existing culture, we can not assume
that people will automatically start thinking in Glosa; and, because Glosa
does not concretely see words as distinct parts of speech, nor does it have
the facilitation of "inflections", the learner is left to juggle the raw
concepts as ideational words.  This is an acquirable trick, but it can also
be a bit of a shock to people brought up in the learning-by-hearing
tradition.  Here I have to mention creativity: the more imagination a
person has, then the faster they will catch onto Glosa's founding formula.

   Of course, we don't tell people this is also the problem with English,
and the minimal degree of inflection (~5) allows people to think of English
as a normal sort of European language.  But it is not: English is a
'bastard' language comprising two different grammatical systems, one of
which is 'syntax-based.'
   So, Glosa does what English has been tending to do - dropping out the
inflections - but carries this trend on to its logical conclusion.
     EG  the English cricket team  -->  the England cricket team

>And has anyone ever wondered why we use an emblem that is a marketing and
logo design nightmare to sell our language?  At least the Esperantists have
a simple green star ... and an easily recognizable flag ...
>
*  Good question.  I didn't wonder: I knew.  Ron Clark chose the Greek
letter "Psi" to symbolise the idea behind Glosa.  He doubled the circular
bit to say there is an inner and an outer level of Glosa usage.  The outer
represents the more pedestrian use of language, while the inner circle
represents more rigorous usage - within science, law and business.

           /           \
          |  /       \  |
          |  |   |   |  |
           \  \__|__/  /
            \____|____/ 
                 |
                 |
                 |

   Agreed, it doesn not translate readily into the popular culture, nor
onto flag or in email.  So, an extra - more popularly recognisable - symbol
might be needed.

   With apologies about the length of this post, I look forward to working
with the group that supports Walter in his aims.

Saluta,

   But with a topic on which there are so many understandings of truth, I

   In short, I cannot pin down the concepts to a KAUR, if I have not been
able to locate the KAUR concept we are dealing with - using my own personal

   Would you please give me a translation of ~kosmo-alo-uno-ra~ into Sunday

*    Hello Sid and All,
     While Sid sees capitals, and, I suspect, fullstops, as optional extras
in Glosa, I do not.
     Firstly, hindi users of Glosa - I have not met any yet - might choose
to optionally avoid the use of capital letters and most punctuation, but
the downside of this could be that many Glosa-pe will not attempt to read
what they have written.
     Secondly, with a syntax-based grammar system, I feel that Glosa needs
all the legitimate help it can get.  In fact, it is my considered belief
that punctuation is a part of Glosa grammar, acting as sign-posts to the
start and finish of the various elements of sentences.
     Thirdly, Capitals have to main functions, in Glosa, as I see it: they
denote the start of a new sentence; and they indicate the presence of a
proper noun - a particular person or place.
      mi fe-fili gina pa dice qestio qe id du pluvi     .......... (1)
  OR
      Mi fe-fili, Gina, pa dice qestio, ~Qe, id du pluvi?~.   .... (2)

    I suspect that each of thes sentences could be marked, with points
accumulating for ambiguity/lack_of_clarity, and I feel that the former
version would show a greater mandicap rating than the latter.
    While the writer of 1. would know where to pause, and where to put
vocal stress, when he read it out, someone else handed the message might
have to think for a while before he could understand the message - as he
thought the writer intended it.
    Someone reading 2. as an 'unseen', on the other hand, has twelve
additional cues to the structure, semantics and unusual components of the
sentence, and could read it with suitable pauses and vocal stress,
directly, by making use of these non-alphanumeric clues.

    Sid, I, for one, find the reading of your posts difficult, because of
the lack of signposts to their structure.

    If you are conducting an experiment, what is its hypothesis, how do you
test it, and when do you know that the hypotesis has been disproved?

    Fashions in language come and go, and some just keep coming.  At
present, the smart young things are leaving out increasing numbers of
commas from their writing.
    I predict that there will ultimately be a swing against this trend ..
when grammar is again taught in our schools.  I am not sure how many
generations will get lost in the wilderness of stream_of_consciousness-type
writing before the cry goes up - for greater clarity in the structure of
prose; things could get a lot worse, before they start getting better.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

    But, I know Ron had the capacity to work at Genius level, and I also
know that I do not.  So, I fear that further years spent in trying to
derive a different formulation, based on present Glosa, and forming a
superior language from it - much as Ron derived Glosa from Interglossa -
would end with me dead, as well, also not seeing the full fruition of the
new form I had created.

    I see my role more as a Beta Tester of Glosa, and not as that of a
co-creator of the world's best 'syntax-based' language.  During the time
that I was Alpha Testing Glossa/Glosa (1982 - 1992) I had a pretty bumpy
ride.  Since entering the Beta Testing phase, I have felt much happier,
there having been many fewer changes.

    Personally, I have not enough room in my life, nor years up my sleeve,
to go through a phase of Alpha Testing, again.  And, if we look at the
progress made, up til now, on the Glosalist, we could predict a very slow
speed of progress, if people were asked to go back to basics, and start
again, with some New Millenium Glosa.
    Ron Clark, after working with Interglossa for about four year, did,
around 1976, clear the slate, and start again - with a revision and
simplification of  Hogben's "outline" of an auxillary language.

    However, it does test my imagination .. to the limit .. to try to push
the basic framework of Glosa(Clark/Ashby, 1992) into a better shape than it
is already.  Agreed, the refinements of vocabulary are calling, and a
clear, simple statement of Glosa's grammar would help, but these are
peripheral to the language's specification, which seems pretty damned good.

    My guess, is, that with urging from Walter and Carmelo, Glosa is due to
take a step forward, not backwards, into Gamma testing.  I welcome this,
and will do my best to trim around the edges, of any ragged pieces
remaining from the Beta Testing phase.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

   One of the original authors is dead, and the second is not as active as
we might have hoped: non-Net and arthritic.

   Sorry about Asterix, but you can start your letters "Karo Fred" and end
them with a non-comicbook, "Saluta."
   Actually, for thousands of years, "Ave!" was more of a farewell. 
   To address "Friends" using Glosa, you might find ~Mi Plu Amika,~ more to
your liking.

   No Glosa is not actually a 'skim' of the worlds languages; it is much
more a "language for science - that can be spoken by the common man, as well."
   And here's a neat concept: recall the teaching of Scientific French and
Scientific Russian, etc; now, imagine that instead of Russian or French
joining words between the scientific terminology, you stick "glue words"
from the same (Greko-Latin) source as the terminology;  you end up with
something that can be called Scientific Scientific.

   Needless to say such a streamlined, simplified language needs a grammar:
Ron Clark, the prime author chose the logical structure of English sentence
construction, but got rid of the five inflections in English, and created a
grammar which is 'syntax-based.'  Recall how computer programming languages
always go on about their syntax - but never about their 'inflections.'  He
thought the language was so simple, obvious and logical that he avoided
publishing a Glosa Grammar: he said the mind sorted it out intuitively; it
is possible that, in this, he over-estimated human capabilities.

*  Just because Glosa uses the plain Euro alphabet, you might imagine that
it is Euro-based.  However consider for a moment, a World auxilliary
language will have to use a single form of graphical representation: what
is you preference?
   Did you know that the Chinese see their language as a potential global
auxilliary with all of its umpteen thousands of characters.

   BTW in your studies of lojban did you find it to be a very precise,
rule-based proscriptive language?  Well human beings don't work like that:
our biological logic circuits are much more fuzzy and imprecise.
   Although I perhaps should not say it, because even the great Chomsky
could not spell it out, Glosa was designed to mirror the 'Universal
Language of Thought.'  Please consider: perhaps Clark, using creativity,
intuited something that Chomsky, with all of his intelligence, did not.

   An easy to follow statement of the grammar is in the process of being
developed, and a course suitable for 'Further Education' is being mooted by
Walter.

>Language does of course change (Marlowe can be great, but he's fucking
impossible to read in any original form without translating
>constantly), but yes, I agree the literature of last decade must
>remain comprehensible!
>
*  I suggest that global civilisation is just around the corner, and it
could be a good thing; but, if we are to make it work for the best,  it
will need a humanly usable auxilliary language.  The Star Trek time scale
possibly is just beginning.

>The glosa symbol I also thought ridiculous.  How about a red triangle?
It's easy, and it can be asciified thusly: [/\]  
>
*  Perhaps we should call in the graphic designers.
   I note that triangles are getting a bad press from the No-NWO people.
And for this reason, I would like to steer clear of triangles, even though
the idea of a "Global Language" could be part of some NWO agenda.


>The main things that repelled me from esperanto:
>
>1: There were suffixes for: male, unspecified-gender and female.  The
>   default form of words was probably male but I was unsure about what
constituted best practice.
>2: There was no list of absolute minimum vocabulary, such as glosa
>   mil.  The closest I could find was a vocab list for GCSE
>   (high-school-level (16 y/o) exams in Britain).
>
* my problem is that having invested five years in learning Esperanto, an
esperantist over-identifies with the language that has stollen so much of
his life.

>The main things that attracted me to glosa:
>
>1: A pair of dictionaries in a well-described text-based format so I
>   could hack together a basic word-lookup tool.  My esperanto equivalent
is *much* cruder.
*  Please name them so we can get the feedback.

>2: It's a piece of piss to read with a dictionary programme; I learnt
>   the basics from a big list of translated sentences about `she is going
to town' etc.  This was much easier than the intellectual effort
>   required to read a tutorial.
>
*   Again, I'd appreciate feedback.
    I always thought that Ron said h'ed written the specification so that
Glosa would be emminently suitable for the machine handling of information.

>On a more negative note, I was put off considerably by the connection
>to latin.  That word evokes fear in people!  I would suggest replacing it
with "common european word roots" wherever possible!
>
*  Sorry about the irrational fear.
   Most of the early terms from science are derived from Latin; though,
now, Greek is proving more useful.
   The original word stem is called Indo-European: both Greek and Latin
come from this; and I simplify the phrase "Greek and Latin roots" to saying
"the Classical roots of science."

>I never used the esperanto interactive tutorials (OK, so I did, but
>not the interactive element); I would welcome friendly glosa intro
>material, of course, but for my own learning, I'd rather have my
>dictionary-grepper and a translated fairy-tale (If anyone wants to
>write/translate fairy tales or similar literature, I'd love it!).
>
*  Glad to hear Eo has modern instructional materials.
   Yes Glosa urgently needs multimedia instruction .. as well as good B&W
laser printable instruction, as well.
   Funny you shold mention fairy tales; I did over Three bears, Red Riding
Hood and Cinderella in historical time; these archival items are still on
my website (probaly needing a little editing to update their language usage).
   I intend, in about a month, to get started with Flash MX; however, your
computer skills sound a lot better than mine.  Please stick around: we
probably can use you. 
 
Only Kidding,

Robin Gaskell 
  P.S.  Any inputs you can make towards progressing the Glosa saga will be
greatly appreciated.
  P.P.S. Do a Google search on Glosa, and you'll find a lot there;

reluctantly i produce this english - the glosa should have been enough, if 
not we need to think why not ....
i was asked why i was an atheist - answer was, i didn't know so i thought 
perhaps creation theories might help so i cooked up some models
1] there was nothing and then the universe-or-something UOS/KAUR appeared out 
of the blue or whatever colour nothing is
2] the UOS has always been there - back for infinity,  forward for infinity
3] something made the UOS - creator or something COS/FRAUR
but we now need to examine the beginning of COS
4] the COS suddenly started from nothing
5] the COS has always been there
6] the COS was created by another COS - COS -> COS-> COS-> ....... UOS from 
infinity
we can combine 4,5,6 with 1,2,3 - that2 's 9 compinations/permutations or 
something
some are difficult to imagine
there is no way that i can prove which of these is true and, i suspect, 
no-one else can so i apply Ockham's axe. choose the simplest one that seems 
to work. they have become more and more complex from the beginning so back 
there.
1 has nothing and COS, 2 has just COS so that's the one i shall chose till i 
am convinced that one of the others is in fact true 
there is only the universe-or-something and it has always existed.
i shall develop the idea further, later  [in glosa]

that dosn't really explain why i'm an atheist .......

here is part of a Christ book, the Bible, without references to God:-
Christ said that we ought love our nieghbours and he was asked 'who is my 
nieghbour?'
a man travelled from Jerusalem to Jericho but was badly beaten, everything he 
had was stolen and he was left like dead. some people passed but didn't 
help.however, a man from Samaria stopped and gave much help.samarian people 
were despised by the local people.Christ said to love our enenies and forgive 
them - he said many things about loving nieghbours.
if all people did not look at references to God but acted as Christ said, not 
incliding God, the world would be much, much happier

Subject: [glosalist] vocabulary cleanup
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 2002 01:43:15 -0800

I've generated a vocabulary of 6730 words from several
international public-domain sources, including the
combined Glosa list, Ido/Novial, the Romance languages,
and a few others. The algorithm is impartial and
reproducible, and capable of improvement and updating.

All words conform to the easily-pronounced bisyllabic
consonant-vowel pattern, resembling the "scientific
combining forms" in ease of compounding, yet still
remain somewhat recognizable or at least plausible
at-first-sight to Romance speakers.

While not "perfect" or "final", this appears much
more attractive and practical than the current
Glosa vocabulary. I think it would be a good basis
for the necessary Glosa reforms. It is even possible
to write tolerable pidginesque text by using it
experimentally without any grammatical particles.

If anyone here is interested. In the last world-war
most interest in IALs died; looks like a repeat now.

imagine a very small animal. it has fur, blunt nose,
a short tail and small bright eyes. he sleeps in a hole in the ground during 
the day and feeds on plants near his hole, at night. he lives alone, he keeps 
away from other males and they keep away from him. if a female comes, he 
welcomes her for a short time and then she goes away.

dear Robin and all
Robin asks me if I am experimenting, yes, and investigating too. I have been 
a glosa-pe for about 30 years [an esperanto person for about half an hour]. 
if I had not thought highly of G, I would have left it long ago, however, I 
think that like everything else in the world, there are shortcomings and it 
is these that I am looking at. also I was in touch with hindi and similar 
languages while i was teaching and helping boys from southern asia.
my views on full stops seem to be misunderstood rather. If I were 
[hand]writing in G or any other language with the roman alphabet and could 
keep my writing legible, i would make the dot at the end of a sentence 
largish and slightly far away from the last letter. no problems in seeing it 
and it works perfectly adequately.
however in some type fonts the dot is tiny and put next to the last 'd'. as 
far as i am concerned the dot is invisible and looks like part of the 
squiggly bit at the end of the letter [serif]. i just can't see it! This 
seems to have been noticed long, long ago. Instead of doing something about 
the dot, it has been decide to make the following letter a capital. now we 
have to learn 52 letters instead of 26 and we have the end doubly and 
redundantly marked!
