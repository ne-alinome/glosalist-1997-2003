They cover only negation (two types), grammar (past participle) and gender.  
Possibly there are some more that could be added.  To me the "feel" is very
important: when we say the prefix, does the sound embody the concept that is
assigned to the letters used?

*       They look reasonable, and worth trying.  I would like to see these used 
in sentences to guage the "feel" they give.  Others on the Forwarder might
like to suggest suffixes (consonant, vowel type), for categories not
otherwise covered.  I would like a prefix, for example, to cover the idea of
"some of."
For some time, now, I've imagined DES, from the French, doing the job, but
it might be more consistent to use DE- before a measurable concept-word to
convey this, EG  U familia pa fago de-pani.  vs.  Pro prima-vora mu pa habe
des pani.

        Bill Patterson mentioned the possible use of -LI for either 
"of rock"  - from LITO,
"of wood"  - from LIGNI
 
Hogben used -LI = "of stone, rock", and so does the Glosa list of generics.
        Glosa could use -RO from ROKA for "of rock"
        and -LI for "of wood", but this would cause confusion.

        My guess is that since -LI has been set ~in stone~ to make a bad pun,
we should find something else for "woody."  From this, it looks like -XI from 
XILO should be used for "of wood."

        Another generic, hand-written in my dictionary, is -KO from KOMPANI,
and the example, also hand-written, is PUBLIKA-KO = publisher.

For those who do not have "Glosa 6000" I retype the 18 Generics in that
book, and use minimal page-width plus "dot" formatting:-

        18 Generic Terms
GENERIC.........MEANING........EXAMPLE........ENGLISH
-BO, BOteka.....shop...........pani-bo........baker's shop
-BO-PE..........shop-keeper....pani-bo-pe.....baker
-DO, DOmi.......house,building.agri-do........farm-house
-FA, FAski......set,bundle.....flori-fa.......bouquet
-FI, FIlament...thread.........kupra-fi.......copper wire
-KA, KAmera.....room...........kuko-ka........kitchen
-KO, KOmpani....business.......publika-ko.....publisher *[Added]
-LI, LItho......stone..........lamina-li......slate #[Old spelling]
-LO, LOka.......place..........panto-lo.......everywhere
-MA, MAteria....stuff,material.geo-ma.........mineral
-ME, MEkani.....device.........grafo-me.......typewriter
-MO, MObili.....furniture......grafo-mo.......desk
-PE, PErsona....person.........navi-pe........mariner
-RA, ReAl.......thing..........bio-ra.........organism
-RU, instRUment.tool...........fora-ru........drill
-TE, TExtili....cloth..........nasi-te........handkerchief
-VA, VAsa.......container......soma-va........bath
-VE, VEsti......garment........pedi-ve........shoe,boot
-ZO, ZOna.......ring...........meso-zo........belt,girdle

        I will also send Paul photocopies of the "Interglossa" pages on
generics: Hogben had sixteen generics, one of which, -RE, is not included in
Glosa.  Perhaps  -RE = concerning  is too fuzzy for Glosa.
 --------------------------------------
        For another day: there could be a good case for having a separate
category of suffixes, four-letter ones, like -ISMO, to make
lexical items into various types of abstractions.

Saluta,

Am sending you, Bill, the "Experimental Glosa Dictionaries" disk, but so far, 
have not found time to print the G-E double-sided, three-column dictionary.  I
hope you have time to print it yourself from the disk.  HINT for the
even-numbered pages, move the paper about half an inch to the right in the
printer.  Of course, the idea is that you print seventeen odd pages first,
then take the paper out of the printer, turn it over and print the
even-numbered pages on the reverse, making sure that Page 2 prints on the
reverse of page 1.
If you cannot get this done, I will print one, here, and send it.

The offer of an "Experimental Glosa dictionaries" disk is open to all, on
the Mail Forwarder, who wish to try their hand at writing Glosa.  As well as
the Glosa 6000 dictionary, I now use the G-E.ALL and E-G.ALL elecronic files
plus,
for further help, I use the Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary, the
Collins Gem Greek-English dictionary and the Reader's Digest "Word Finder."

On the help side, you will see the extensive \SYNONYMS  subdir. on the disk:
this needs altering before I print and send to Africa!  There are four
options that have been suggested:-

        A. Send the E-G file as it is, suitably compacted (3 col.,
dbl-sided), but this would be confusing to learners.  You and Paul would
probably object to this.
        B. Extensively revise the synonyms using a range of entries having
modifiers ... word(mildly) GLOSAWORD(S)1; word(in extreme) GLOSAWORD(S)2; etc.
This would take a lot of effort and involve serious dictionary research plus
a concensus between those doing it.  I would call this the "GLOSA 6000
Literary Dictionary" and it is not what we need at the moment.  This could
be produced in the future.
        C. The reduction of the entries to have only one synonym,
eliminating the rest of the possible synonyms.  How would you suggest
indicating the major word and the synonym, to be certain everyone knew which
was the preferred usage?
Paul B. has already said one synonym was one too many.  I prefer the
stylistic option of having the synonym, but must bow to the pragmatis of the
best presentation of the language for best results, EG water HIDRA,G._AQA.
        Originally it was AQA, but then Richmond preferred HIDRA, now I
treat this Greek word as my preferred usage.  How many people would write
off Glosa if water was always HIDRA without the option of using the
widely-known AQA?
        D. Use only one Glosa word for each English word listed: Paul says
this is the only way to reduce confusion (EG Someone uses AQA, and I use
HIDRA, and we think we are talking about different things.).  Ths
one_lexical_item_ per_ entry dictionary is what Paul prefers.  I would go
along with this ... leaving room in a small number of cases for one synonym
... It might be the "Kindergarten Glosa 6000" dictionary.  This would need
some agreement on which ONE was selected.  Please think about how you, Paul
and I could rapidly reach concensus on the single lexical item per entry.

easy would this be for you:-
        a. SORT alphabetically.
        b. Divide up into 180 entry chunks.
        c. Cut up to place two of the 60-entry bits to the right of the first
        (noting a twenty four, or twentyfive, character limit per entry) IE
x ->    x y z
x       x y z
x       x y z

Which feels like "Next week": FU SETIMANA or FU SEPTIMATINA?  I believe that
we can search back through our primative associations, and sense 
which of the constructs is closer to the primitives of language.  The trap
is in getting caught up in the intellectualisms of later language evolution.
In general, the shorter the word, the more easily it rolls off the tongue

I will try to get it all under the belt, before attempting another

operate a Glosalist Mailing List, at last.  It just needs my understanding
of the system - I'm not relishing the thought of playing with the system:
I'm more of a user than a techie.

*       As I see it, the Glosa authors a decade, or so, ago, adopted
Hogben's Generics with one deletion and three additions, and have left it
that way ever since.  All of their energies over the past ten years have
been in promotion of the language, with none put into extending or reviewing
the design of the language.  Personally, I believe that the language can be
extended and 'enriched' through a review of the design elements.  The
problem with this is that most of the learners have only "Glosa 1000", and
the rest have "Glosa 6000".
        The Glosa Central reasoning is probably geared to getting on with
the language, as published in 1992, and to avoid confusion with changes to
this '92
pattern.
        However, the Glosa Tense Table was developed after the publication
of Glosa 6000, and has circulated well enough.  An extended Generics list
can be circulated in a similar way.

    We know that this date is in the past, so 'pa' is completely
unnecessary here.  Many people have accused Glosa of being nothing more
than a direct replacement code for (relexification of) English.  This
sort of usage just confirms that accusation.  We have to avoid letting
native language habits dominate our usage.  Otherwise, we may have
trouble communicating with people who have other native language
habits.  I think tense and plurality markers tend to be overused.

    How do you speak a hyphen?  Many of us in western countries are so
used to dealing with written texts that we forget that language is
first and foremost a spoken/heard phenomenon, and not marks on a paper 
or computer screen.

Good point, Paul! I've fixed my reply-header.

Yes. As in "Yesterday we went" - well, we *know* it happened in the
past before we even get to the second word in that sentence, so why
worry about conjugation? Once we've established the time or the
subject(s), there's no reason to repeat that information.

As with "setimana" I feel that the hyphens will disappear from common
compounds. I dislike hyphens inside words. In English I rarely use them
except when I feel that they are absolutely necessary. And that necessity
is determined to a large extent by the familiarity of the word to both me
and the reader. And by our familiarity with the words which make up that
word. As I learn Glosa I find myself using hyphens much more frequently
than I normally do, and in fact *relying* upon them to help me parse
compound words. As I learn more, they won't be as helpful because then
I'll more quickly recognize the words that make up the compounds.

And this probably applies to Generics also. On Robin's pages I saw "redice"
and "re-dice". I prefer the look of "redice" and will undoubtedly spell it
that way. However, "re-dice" was immediately recognizable to me but "redice"
was not. So when I feel more comfortable with Glosa I'm sure that I'll soon
be applying that same writer/reader word familiarity rule.

It's late and I'm tired so I'm not going to look now but I must check my
notes to see if there is a standard rule covering these Glosa hyphens...

In the spoken language as in the written language, common compounds wouldn't
need a hyphen, but with compounds that are less common I bet the hyphen is
represented by a bit of a pause, and then a trailing "Know what I mean?"
kind of a look is appended to the word...

Synonyms

Suggested criteria for the selection of the "preferred" words:

1. The synonym which is used most often in common compounds should be
   the preferred word. Setimana argues for seti and mana rather than
   septi and matina.

2. For groups of logically related words, the preferred words should all
   come from the same language, for predictability.

3. Shorter words are probably better.   

4. The preferred word should not look or sound too much like some other
   totally unrelated word. This will probably be the trickiest criterion
   to apply!

5. For groups of logically related words, consider how the words might
   be used. For example, directions are often abbreviated, so Nord, Est,
   Sud, Uest are preferable to Boreo, Orienta, Austra, Ocide (which,
   however, make for wonderful literary synonyms!)

I can't wait to see that \SYNONYM directory! The first thing I plan to
do is write a little search program to implement that first criterion,
searching the lexicon for compounds...

   I tend to agree with you about Gaskell-Glosa and even, to some
extent, Aashby&Clark-Glosa (Ashby&Clark being the principals of Glosa). 
Even the latter, in some of their writings, tend to mark tense and
number either when it is already marked in some other or when it is
irrelevant.  There is a very small (and not overly active) discussion
group for Glosa (email me if you want to join), and twice recently I
have tried to point out overuse of markers.  Unsually I get either no
response at all or "Of course, but......."  Glosa does not *have* to
be just recoded English, but some users make it that way.  I sometimes
wonder if the Glosa-pe are their own worse enemies.

*       No hyphens are not for sounding, just for the reader (and the

to be a compound, straight away.  Hyphens could be left out altogether, but
word derivation hints would be lost, and for those who are etymologicallyminded,
some of the interest in language would be lost.  Also, I am being pedantic,
again, in wishing to observe the "words-do-not-change-for-reasons-of-grammar"
rule.  As I see it, a compound with a hyphen in it is two words (neither
changing for grammar), while an unhyphenated compound is a new word.  This
is a different argument from the one for punctuation, which I consider to be
the indication of vocal change due to sentence structure.

    It seems clear enough to me.  If some other construct in a sentence
indicates something like time, plurality, or sex, then a marker is not
necessary.  Redundant grammatical markers do not do much harm, but they
are just that: redundant.  The problem is that if they are overused,
some people may come to regard them as necessary, which can lead to
confusion and misunderstanding of the spirit of the language.  It gives
rise to the accustion that Glosa really is an inflected language, which
it is not.

Subject: Experimental Dictionaries
To: Robin Gaskell
Date: Tue, 14 Oct 97 20:1

Hi Robin!

I received the Experimental Dictionaries disk today.

I've printed out the G-E dictionary. Tried printing from DOS first but
(due to printer setup probably) some bottom lines were getting shoved
to the following pages. So I jumped into Windows and used the Works word
processor, with size 10 Courier New font and .75 inch top and bottom
margins.

But I noticed that each formfeed in the PRT*.* files was followed by
two blank lines, so the first page of the file prints ok but subsequent
pages are too long. Maybe that was the problem. And GALAXY appears to
append two CTRL-Z characters to the end of the file, sort of in the old
CPM or DOS fashion. I wonder if it *requires* them? If so, I'll have
to remember to append them to files I send to you!

I skimmed over the pages as they printed and noticed some synonym problems.
I see you've already got LISO in the synonyms directory. TITO is another
one: "kind of owl" or "small, young". Well, those aren't really synonyms -
I forget the word for what they are - words that are the same but have
different meanings!

And "vanish" appears as EVANESCE, VANESKE, and VANESCE.

And "bigamy" appears as BI-GAMI. A typo, perhaps? Since elsewhere GAME
is the marriage word. (That was in the E-G.ALL).

I was tickled by the fact that "big breasts" have their own word: BUMASTA.
But is that singular or plural? Should be singular? I would like to assume
that all Glosa things are singular unless plued, so to say.

E-G.ALL & G-E.ALL will be very handy. L6 turns out to be version 6.2a of
Buerg's LIST program. I use that all the time! I've got version 7.6a. It's
a bit larger than L6. One nice feature is that if you just enter LIST, it
brings up a directory listing, and you can navigate the directories and
select the file to read. There's also a newer version out there in the
universe somewhere - I tried it, but preferred this version, though I don't
remember why. I think because it had too many fancy features than I didn't
want in a lister program.

I hope to get back to "Un Lupus" soon. I've just been too busy. And now
I'm anxious to dig into these synonyms. Well, this is how I learn best!

Subject: Synonyms & Relexifications
To: William
Date: Thu, 16 Oct 97 22:4


Just a few thoughts off the top of my (aching!) head.
(I've had a nasty headcold these past few days.)

I haven't examined the synonym files yet, but I did print the Glosa-
English dictionary and begin reading through it. There seem to be
many synonyms in there, which is probably proper for a Glosa-natlang
dictionary, though in a natlang-Glosa dictionary we should have one
preferred word, marked as such (or the assumption that the first
synonym is the preferred word (and for clarity one should stick to
it!). Even then, though, is it necessary to have seven words for
"food"? And four words for "five"? Perhaps in Literary Glosa?

As a slightly tangential comment, I want to repeat that I *like*
synonyms and antonyms. This is one thing that I like about Ido in
comparison to Esperanto, though I have much more experience with
Esperanto. Few synonyms and no antonyms makes for easier learning,
but also gets boring after a while. And sometimes ugly. So I was
amused and pleased to find that many of my favorite "literary"
Esperanto words achieved perfect respectability in Ido, even as Ido
retains the ability to construct antonyms by use of a prefix, useful
when one knows only one member of an antonymic pair, and isn't able
for whatever reason to look up the other; though I'm not sure it's
considered good form, it would certainly be understandable.

Anyway, back to Glosa. I've found what appear to be relexifications
(don't get me wrong! I also feel that a little relex isn't always
bad!) of English forms of Latin phrases. "Ad lib" from English "ad
lib" from Latin "ad libitum", for example. It's not the relex which
bothers me; it's the fact that there appears to be no Glosa word
"lib". Now, since "ad libitum" means "at pleasure", I'd suggest that
we use "ad hedo" for this concept; or perhaps just remove the space
and coin a new word "adlib" - I prefer "ad hedo". Or perhaps
"ad-hedo" or "adhedo". Or does that make it a relex of Latin?

Another is "ad hok", when Glosa has no "hok". And "ad rem" when there
is no Glosa word "rem"? Though I'm not familiar with the phrase "ab
ovo" (from the start), there appears to be no Glosa word "ovo"; but
there is "ova" (egg) and I rather like the translation of "ab ova",
which would be "from the egg". Or is one of those ov- words a typo?
Or is this one of those terminal inconsistencies that Paul mentioned?

And now, the goats. I can accept two words for goat: "aegi" and
"kapri". But first I question the -i in "aegi", since the Greek word
is "aego". Second, "aegialo" (shore) follows "aegi" in the dictionary
and since both "aegi" and "alo" (or, alternative) *are* Glosa words,
one might assume (if not knowing better) that "aegi" and "aegialo"
are somehow related. Goat alternatives, anybody?

And thirdly, why isn't a "kaprimulgus" (goat - kid) a "kapri-fili"?

Sadisti: hunter, sadist. This may be a problem for some people!

And my setimana! This dictionary contains no "seti" but it does add
"hepta". And my "mana" has been replaced by "di", giving "septi-di"!
Seven-days - just doesn't seem as lyrical to me as seven-mornings.

Are we creating Fili, the Glosa equivalent of Esperanto's Ido?
Or is Glosa already the Fili, being the child of Interglossa?
How does one say "grandchild" in Glosa?

Another tangent: when the computer language C++ was named there was
some argument as to whether it should be called D or P. You see, BCPL
begat B, and B begat C. The question was, should the name of the next
language be determined alphabetically, or once again by the BCPL
sequence? I guess they decided to avoid the problem completely.

Oh, well, enough babbling for one night.
I'm tired.
But I *am* having fun!

- Saluta! - Bill

He forgets what's around, even the pilot in the cock-pit hears the

Possibly the MISSING.E-G file will turn up in your e-mail reader

        Re synonyms, I think a decision must be made for the learner's First
Glosa dictionary.  I, too, like synonyms - though am not necessarily so keen
on antonyms - and found the Glosa 1000 too stifling, altogether.  I would
say that one major Glosa word, with only one synonym, where it seemed
`popular', might be 
a rule of thumb for whittling down the E-G.ALL to an acceptable form.

        A "Middle 6000" with two or, at most, three, synonyms could follow.
However, I feel that some explanatory adjective or adverb would probably help -
as suggested by Paul Bartlett.  The "Literary 6000", with all possible synonyms,
is outside my range of language knowlege, and of very limited projected use.
Again, I think that clarification of the synonyms would be necessary .. to
differentiate between their nuances of meaning.

one quite deeply, hence my working with Glosa, which I still think is the

This *is* interesting. E-G.ALL and G-E.ALL have only one trailing CTRL-Z,
but INFO.TXT and LET_TO.WWP have two! Anyway, that's the old CP/M and
early DOS style, using CTRL-Z to mark the end-of-file. Newer programs
don't care whether it's there or not. Though some programs, both old and
new, will stop reading when they hit a CTRL-Z, even if it's in the middle
of a file.

GALAXY doesn't seem to mind if the input file has no trailing CTRL-Z. I
created a file without CTRL-Z and opened it in GALAXY. Worked OK. And
when I saved it, GALAXY appended two CTRL-Zs. But it does stop reading if
I stuff a CTRL-Z into the middle of a file. No big deal, because that's
something one has to do on purpose - it won't happen under normal
circumstances.

Beginning with G-E.ALL, I wrote an awk script to create GE0.TXT,
which consists of lines of the form "glosaword = englishword", one
word from each language per line. Then I re-sorted, and then used vim
and uniq to pull out the lines that begin with the same Glosa words.
The purpose was to locate (as much as possible!) all those Glosa
words which appear to have multiple meanings; not just similar
meanings (synonyms), but completely different meanings. For example,
I found that "amo" means "like", "love" and "sand", and "hipo" means
"below", "under" and "horse". Some of these result from a Greek word
clashing with a Latin word. Some may be typos. But I'd like to clean
them up before I continue.

I'm currently looking at 274 such words. Here's an example of a
fairly simple situation:
   KANCERA = cancer - crab
   KARCINO = cancer - crab
   KARCINOMA = cancerous ulcer
For internal consistency of the dictionary, here are my choices:
   KANCERA = crab
   KARCINO = cancer
   KARCINOMA = cancerous ulcer

And another:
   TIRO = beginner - cheese (!)
   TYRO = beginner
   KASEA = cheese
Here are my choices:
   KASEA = cheese
   TIRO = beginner
I chose TIRO rather than TYRO because the Glosa Basic Reference says
that the "y" in Greek words should be replaced by "i".

Qestio: Should TIRO instead be considered literary? A synonym? Maybe
we should instead construct "beginner" using the "-pe" Generic. We'd
have to choose our rootword carefully. Would a beginning-person be a
novice or a baby? Another example, we find:
   MANTI = divination - soothsayer
and I'm wondering if we should have MANTI = "divination" and MANTI-PE
for soothsayer.

Which brings to mind another criterion for synonym selection: a
synonym which spawns a Generic should be the Primary! Of course, only
a few words could possibly be affected by this. Maybe none. But it's
pretty important, I think.

Plus questio: GOMFO represents bolt, nail and peg, but sometimes I
think we'd need to be more specific as to which one we really should
be using. Any suggestions? The Glosa dictionary contains several
words for nail, but they all seem to be the biological kind, except
maybe for one that I don't recognize: what sort of nail is an AKU?

Once we've got these multiple-meaning words nailed down, I plan to
invert the file and consolidate the synonym lines to form a literary
English-Glosa dictionary. Then we can select a primary synonym for
each English word, resulting in the basic English-Glosa dictionary.

So I envision three dictionaries:
   a glosa-natlang dictionary containing all the words
   a literary natlang-glosa dictionary containing all the words
   a basic natlang-glosa dictionary containing only primary synonyms
Of course, the literary dictionary could also function as a basic
dictionary if we assume that the first synonym is the primary.   

Has anybody else noticed that the creators of Glosa seemed to be
awfully fond of bogs and marshes and mud and and pipes and other such
watery things, and suet and fat and grease, too?

Hello, Robin!
        Thank you again for your kind messages of support, which were 
most earnestly appreciated.  I am getting better (can now move about the 
house pretty much with a cane, though wheelchair or walker for trips in 
the car) and regaining strength.  The problem is stamina, of which I 
still have but little.
        Glosa is moving up on my agenda.  One of these days....
        Anyway, all the best to you, and to the folks on Glosalist, 
should you like to forward this.
                Plu kardia saluta ex
                John
