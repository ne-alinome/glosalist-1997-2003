        The word, "homonym" covers words with the same spelling but different, 
and unrelated, meanings.

*       That is a lot.  The authors claimed originally, that in the Glosa
vocabulary, they would avoid Classical Clashes, where there were Greek and
Latin roots with similar spellings.

*       My feeling is that the Glosa authors erred on the side of excess,
knowing that, one day, an analytical mind like Bill's would come along and
find the fine line that sorted the vocabulary into rational order.
        It is my belief that we cannot afford the luxury of unnecessary, and
definitely confusing, synonyms in a language that is presented as
streamlined, with primarily one word per concept.

*       For consistency, the use of category markers, such as -PE give Glosa
part of its distinctive feel, and would be the better choice.  TIRO = cheese
can be kept *in the wings* for literary use, when Glosa has a body of users,
but, for the present we are liable to *drown the baby by overfilling the
bath* to bend a cliche.
        Lexical distinctions, like one between the soothsayer and his
prognostications, are essential if Glosa is to be fully flexible.  The
mechanism is there: you have used it correctly, Bill.  I ask for others on
the Mail Forwarder to give their opinions!?  We can also use MANTI-AN and
MANTI-FE if we need to specify the sex of the diviner.  I would say that
when the Glosa authors were working on the lexicon, they were concentrating
on the *large picture*, and thus, got the job completed; now it is necessary
for us to see that the *detail* has been filled in correctly (or consistently).

*       Agreed: this principle is sound.  For example, is a water-pipe an
AQA-TUBI or a HIDRA-TUBI?  Which 'primary' lends itself better, and "feels"
better, when used to form 'generics'?  AQA-TUBI rolls off the tongue better,
and, by such backward logic, AQA should probably be the 'primary' Glosa-word 
for water.

>
*       Again, such differentiation of meaning is essential.  A "bolt" is
blunt, but anything called an AKU = "needle", "nail" ( from AKUTO = sharpen)
must be
sharp and pointed.  Perhaps when sewing, we use a VE-AKU, and when doing
carpentry, we use a XY-AKU.  When clothiers are talking together, they say
AKU, knowing they are only referring to the sewing needle; while, when
carpenters discus the job they only use AKU, knowing it is a "nail".
        The Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary didn't help much:-
  L-E  gomphus, i - peg, pin.

  E-L  peg - clavus  [L-E  clavus - 1. nail; 2. a) rudder, helm; b) purple
stripe on tunic.]
        pin - acus, us; fibula  [L-E  acus - needle.]

        This world standard dictionary has the same sort of *mulberry bush*
meanings that people criticise in "Glosa 6000".  With more time and
patience, I would look further to differentiate between "pins" and "needles".
        In the end, I try to assemble all of the possible Classical words
with their meanings, and try to distil the original flavour ... or sound
particle ...
that gave each word its conceptual meaning.  This method has been used by
the Glosa authors e.g. PET = fly
        The whole thing is complicated by the fact that the Ancients used
wooden pegs to hold things together, because the technology of nuts and
bolts was not available to them.  So, maybe the modern bolt is a renovation
of the old "peg".
This might give us the Glosa-word GOMFO = bolt .. or, if a bolt is really a 
"screw-peg", HELIKO-GO = screw-peg (bolt).  Maybe the modern "pin" is a
GOMFO in Glosa.

for general dissemination - based, of course, on the 6000 List instead of
the basic 1000 words.  I still feel that room should be left for the few
cases where a synonym is assumed, e.g. AQA (HIDRA) or is it HIDRA (AQA) ?

*       Well, landform and water were very important to the Ancients, who
lived much closer to the elements than we do.  I guess this comes through in
what we know of their culture and language.  Whenever I do dictionary
research in "6000"
I see the mists and rolling hills of ancient Greece, and I am reminded of
what passed for civilisation, in those days, in Rome and Athens.  The
contrast is marked when comparing the Greek and Latin dictionaries: in the
Greek dictionary there are modern figures of speech and contemporary
inventions; the Latin dictionary seems frozen in time - in a pre-industrial
earth-bound culture.
        This flavour has come across in "6000", with words for pine-cones
and pine trees, but nothing for "pins".  I wonder, were pine-needles the
first pins, or did the Ancients use bones from small animals or fish, as
their first sewing pins!
        Perhaps what happened then is just not relevent, now, and all we
have to do is find suitable words - or families of words - that allow us to
differentiate between the different technological concepts available to us
to-day.

    Robin, I must very strongly disagree with you here.  What "feels"
better or "rolls off the tongue better" is so subjective and influenced
by prior conditioning as to be a useless criterion, in my humble
opinion.  The feel and pronounceability are going to be so determined
by one's previous linguistic experience that nobody will agree.  I
suggest this criterion be dropped.

    Unfortunately, no consistent list of "Glosa 1000" exists, as I
found out when I collated official copies from G.E.O.  That's why the
Glosa Basic Reference on the Web pages has more on the order of 1600
words than 1000.  Regardless of whatever the personal and
circumstantial limitations of Ashby&Clark may have been and/or be, this
lack of consistency (as well as in terminal vowels and two Glosa words
for a term) is harmful to the Glosa cause.  People may never know or
care about Ashby&Clark and their personal circumstances: they will only
know the publications, which could have been better done, no matter
_how_ they came to be the way they are.

Both from the Greek:

NASMA = spring - stream
PIDAKO = fountain - spring

There are plenty of words for spring and stream and fountain and such,
and these two words aren't used in any compounds or anywhere else in
the dictionary, so it looks like we're free to define them as we please.
Preferences, anybody?

I'm using DOS versions of these handy Unix programs.

Awk is a programming language that allows you to write programs which
read textfiles one line at a time, find the lines which match some
criterion, then perform some function on those lines. You could do the
same thing in pretty much any language but awk was designed for this
sort of textprocessing so it has lots of useful functions that make the
tasks much easier. Vim is an editor, a freeware superduper version of
Unix vi (vim = vi-improved). Uniq reads a file and writes out any
duplicate adjacent lines. Or you can tell it to write out the lines
which are not duplicated. Grep, fgrep and egrep are like the DOS find,
but with more features.

So, for example, once I had the file of glosaword=englishword records,
I used vim to globally delete everything after the = and then saved
this as a new file, containing only Glosa words. Then I passed this
file to uniq and it returned a file consisting of only the duplicated
Glosa words. Then I wrote an awk program to search the Glosa dictionary
for every word in the duplicates file, writing those words and definitions
to another file. Then I used vim to read that file and remove the
duplicates which were just synonyms, leaving only those duplicate words
with different meanings.

Yes, Robin - homonym, that's the word! How could I have forgotten?

Nicely done, Robin! But it's late - I need to get some sleep

Yes! I had a similar feeling when I first examined the Generics; not
ancient, just not quite modern. That's what prompted my earlier question
about the Generics - the choices seemed odd, but intriguing.

The feeling does get stronger and more ancient as I examine the dictionary.

Unfortunately (or not, depending on one's point of view), as an IAL Glosa
will undoubtedly acquire more modern words, or develop its own substitute
terms for modern concepts. But I can't help liking a language that has
seven words for "marsh", and another for "marsh marigold". I think I'll
add a fourth dictionary to my list, by freezing a copy of the first
literary dictionary, and calling it Classical Glosa.

But I'd argue that in a living language the "feel" would be very important
in unconsciously deciding between two words which are otherwise equivalent.
And though the engineer in me prefers HIDRO (hydraulic, etc.), most of me
does prefer AQA. Since both appear only once in compounds, I feel that this
is a case in which "feel" could be a valid consideration.

Besides, the HIDRO compound is just ANHIDRO (without water), but the AQA
compound is AQARELA (water color) and to me that seems to be of more
significance than the simple negation embodied in the former.

What color is your water?

    Again I want to stress how much this "feel" is strongly biased by
prior conditioning.  If Glosa ever takes off, a lot of learners are
going to be post-adolescents whose language habits are more or less
fixed.  And for that matter, even pre-adolescent children can have a
certain amount of fixity (though less) in their language habits.

    English is basically a Germanic language, and the Germanic and
Slavic languages are notorious for their consonant clusters, which can
be a real struggle for adult learners from other language groups.  I
once worked with refugees whose native language was Khmer, and they had
a devil of a time with the consonant clusters of English.  If they were
assessing different candidate Glosa words, they might
semi-automatically select the one with fewer consonant clusters on the
grounds that it "feels" better, whereas an anglophone or slavophone,
accustomed to consonant clusters, might not even think of such a matter
with regard to how a word "feels."

    My whole point is that we can be led badly astray by our prior
language conditioning as to what "feels" better or "natural."  This
subjectivity has been notorious in the constructed auxliliary language
world.  "Natural" and "feels" better are all too often code words for
"more like my native language."  Other people with native languages
from different language fanilies might think that very different
phenomena "feel" better and more "natural."

    I still maintain that "feel" is so subjective and deceptive as to
be useless in practice.  If you think that you _must_ use it, then by
all means gather a panel of Glosa-pe who have different native
languages from English, preferably those with non-Indo-European native
tongues, and see how much agreement there is on "feel."

{crossposted to AUXLANG, Glosa Discussion

    Some time ago I received a private communication from George
Boeree, the originator of Lingua Franca Nova, from which I will take
the liberty to quote a few lines here.

    I have sometimes wondered what is the justification for the
sometime assumption that a strictly isolating language, say of the
Glosa type, is necessarily "simpler" than a language more of the
agglutinating type, such as Esperanto.  _Why_ must a welter of
particles with otherwise invariant roots somehow _have_ to be "simpler"
than agglutinated morphemes?  What does it even mean to say that one
structural type is "simpler" than another?

    What is a good working vocabulary size for a conIAL, even if we
allow for word derivation from roots?  About how many words do people
need to express more or less what they want to express in everyday
living (apart from specialized, vocational, literary, or technical
terminology)?  Mr. Boeree hypothesizes about 3000 - 4000.  Other 
ideas?

Subject: Hunters/Sadists & Fingers/Toes
To: William
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 97 01:1

Perhaps the creators were trying to make a statement - I don't know.
But here's how I've resolved the SADISTI homonym. Originally, we had...

   CASA = chase, hunt
   SADI = cruel
   SADISTI = hunter - sadist

Now we have...

   CASA = chase, hunt
   SADI = cruel
   SADISTI = sadistic (as in Glosa 1000)
   CASA-PE = hunter
   SADISTI-PE = sadist

I've noticed that there are several words in Glosa 6000 which refer
to people, and end in -STI, and appear to be formed from a root word:
SADI -> SADISTI, DENTI -> DENTISTI, JURNALI -> JURNALISTI, for examples.
Taking a clue from Glosa 1000, I removed the person from SADISTI but
retained the word as a different form of cruelty. There are undoubtedly
other words like this. For words like the other examples, I'd suggest
that we drop the -STI words: DENTI -> DENTI-PE, JURNALI -> JURNALI-PE.

========

DIGITA is a word that looked like a homonym though it isn't really.
DAKTILI probably should have looked like a homonym even though it
isn't, but it didn't, because it was defined only as finger.

We had...

   DAKTILI,G. = finger
   DIGITA = finger - toe
   MANU = hand
   PEDI = foot
   POLEX = thumb
   HALUX = big toe

According to my dictionaries it appears that neither Greek nor Latin
distinguished between the digits of the hands and feet, though somebody
found words for thumb and big toe! In fact, my Greek dictionary refers
to "finger" as "daktilo" and "toe" as "daktilo of the foot".

So we have...

   DAKTILI,G. = digit(finger or toe)
   DIGITA = digit(finger or toe)
   MANU-DIGITA = finger
   PEDI-DIGITA = toe
   POLEX = thumb
   HALUX = big toe

Unless somebody perhaps has a better dictionary, one which gives separate
words for "finger" and "toe"? I still find it hard to believe that neither
of those two languages distinguishes between them!

*       I have not looked at the lists of spring/stream/fountain words, but
I do not agree that we are able to arbitrarily allocate our chosen meanings
to existing lexical items.
 1) I go along with the Huna idea that words are made up of elements that
have 'spiritual' significance.  If we were able to look back far enough, we
would find the primitive start of language, and we would probably find that
the elements of 'watery flowingness' are in NASMA.  I suspect that the "AS"
in NASMA is suggestive of flowing water; the whole word gives me the mental
picture of a wet patch at the bottom of a hill, where the ground-water is
oozing out into a boggy area from which a small rill of flowing water runs
away into a larger riverlet, and so on.
        A bit poetic, I guess, and very subjective, but the original word
had to come from somewhere, and did have a specific meaning, then.  I would
like to imagine that someone with perceptive powers could sit down with the
various synonimous words on his desk with a few Classical dictionaries for
research, and then could fill in the presently significant concepts of
'watery flowingness' - matching up the Classical lexical entries with
current concepts.  
 2) I have to admit that PIDAKO seems like a much more acive word, probably
covering water in the form of an actual squirt.  Is the "AKO" element
suggestive of water 'arcing' in the form of an arch, or is it to do with
pointedness [ref. "aku"], and thus something to do with water from a
fountain or a spring that is spirting water.  In England, there is a small
group of villages that feature the word "Piddle" (= stream) as part of their
name, e.g. Piddle Trenthide.  Maybe a PIDAKO is the water squirt that comes
from a wet rock stratum forming the start of a river.
        Again, poetic ... but not arbitrary, though possibly intuitive.
 ... I hope that this helps in the search for meaning.  I can hear Paul Bartlett
disapproving of this approach as too subjective, but I believe that it is
'intuitve.'

*       I understand, Paul, that my "feeling" is likely to be different from
that of others growing up with other sounds and other neuro-muscular traces
built up in the formation of these sounds.  However, I am trying to be  -
the impossible - impartial, in this.  I am thinking ~Glosa~ and I am
thinking ~elegance~ in sound.  Worse, I am assuming the Roman alphabet: this
is an incorrect assumption for the Chinese people who do not differentiate
between 
/l/, /n/ and /r/.
        But where do we draw the line?  Can we only use one of this trio of
phonemes because, otherwise, many Chinese speakers would have to learn how
to form the new sounds?  That cuts the effective alphabet down to
twenty-four; through a similar process of reduction, reviewing other
languages, how many letters would we be left with?   This leads to the
Gilson (AUXLANG) suggestion that a Global IAL is an impossibility.
        My refutation of this is that LUI Haitao, of China, taught himself
Esperanto, and subsequently Glosa, in which he was quite good, but ... his
attempts at English were atrocious!  Agreed this was in the written form only!!!
        Haitao is now on Auxlang.  Perhaps I should ask him to re-open our
dialogue .. but with the use of voice cassettes to demonstrate his ability
to sound both Esperanto and Glosa.  I would like to know how well his vocal
attempts at the auxiliary languages matches up with his spoken use of them.

*       I would agree with the Khymer speakers: what rolls off the tongue
best is the obvious choice.  And it is true, Glosa started with the  C-V-C-V
pattern.  Some of the later additions .. more the Greek ones .. are a bit
hader to articulate.  Which would be harder for a Khymer to say: AQA or HIDRA?
        Consonant clusters are bad news, and should not be in Glosa.  But I
probably (PROBABILI) accepted them without thinking, because they were no
trouble to me.  Point taken.  I still wonder, though, if the Classical roots
of science can somehow be taken as a baseline in international vocabulary.
Somewhere a decision would have to be made .. along the lines of the need
for sufficient concepts.  Also, some smoothing of sounds could occur, as in
the case of PROBABILI, above.  The consistency of using the Classicals of
science is a factor in the equation, as well.
        Who has to compromise what - if global dialogue is to take place:
the Chinese and others with the learning of new sounds; or those for whom
the Classicals are comfortable .. in the loss of words or the alteration of
spellings, for ease of pronunciation?

>"Natural" and "feels" better are all too often code words for
>"more like my native language."  Other people with native languages

*       All of this points to the fact that, in Glosa, there has been an over-
concentration on th written form of the language.  Now we need to clean up
the act as far as the spoken form goes!

    Not necessarily.  In the 1950's, a Vietnamese author came out with
the auxlang project FRATER.  He explicitly named Bodmer as a source of
ideas, although I suspect they were actually based somewhat on those of
Hogben as expressed in _The_Loom_of_Language_.  I developed and
modified FRATER into my frater2 project, although I have never gotten
vocabulary typed in, so it has been largely an exercise in structure. 
Information on frater2 is available via my auxlang WWW page at

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/

    My whole point is that the sound system of FRATER (which I did not
change in frater2) consists of only eighteen (count 'em) phonemes. 
>From what I have been able to tell, these eighteen are among the most
common phonemes in the world's languages.  As in Glosa, most of the
base vocabulary is taken from Latin and Greek roots, but because of the
limited phoneme inventory, a goodly number of them have undergone some
deformation.  Apparently there was a conscious design decision to place
pronounceability for more above strict recognizability for some. 
FRATER showed that is is completely possible to build an auxlang out of
a limited phoneme inventory.

    Granted, Glosa could not withstand such a severe reduction of
phoneme inventory without losing its character.  But a reduced
inventory does not at all mean an auxlang is thereby impossible.  From
his posts on the AUXLANG list, I suspect that Bruce Gilson's idea that
a truly global conIAL is not possible does not derive from phoneme
inventory.

Ave, panto-pe!

With all those gloomy watery places waiting for us you'd think that
Glosa would provide us with some decent footwear, but all we've got
is...

BOTA = boot              
TROKADA = running shoe     Greek trokadin = at a run, quickly
SOKO = shoe(light)         Latin soccus = light shoe; comedy
UDO = shoe - sock          Latin udo = shoe of felt or skin

Well, ok, the boot would be handy.

BOTA is ok - I think we can leave that one alone. TROKADA's ok too,
though I bet *that* wasn't in Classical Glosa. But what I'm looking
for here is just some plain old shoes and socks. My English bias
tells me to use SOKO for sock, leaving UDO for shoe, but the
etymologies tell me to do the opposite: Latin "udo" sounds more
socklike, and "soccus" is definitely a shoe. (Or a comedy?)

How about some new terms?

I rather like the Latin word for stocking: "tibiale". (The Greek
"kaltda" is too close in sound to KALTA (marsh marigold)).

For shoe, Latin "calceus" works for me - say it out loud, it sounds
better than it looks. KALCEUS. Then there's the Greek "papoutdi" -
but I think that one looks better than it sounds.

And we could then leave UDO as it is, meaning either shoe or sock,
generically footwear. Or maybe yesterday's UDO *is* today's sock.
Kind of an inner, soft shoe.

*       This sort of rationalisation seems necessary to 'standardise' Glosa
forms.  Obviously, for the lexicon, we need different words for 'cruelty'
and 'sadism'.  Here I suggest the noun as the base "concept word".  Both
"cruel" and "sadistic", as you have given them, are adjectives: I imagine
the mind storing its collection of concepts as either objects or actions; so
getting mixed up with psycho-linguistics, I see most of our mental store of
concepts as either nouns or verbs.  EG the Glosa word, KI, is most likely
stored mentally as the action, and not as (in English) "going" - the
gerundive form.  IE KI (= to go)
would seem the base concept, rather than U KI (=the going) or DU KI (=going:
continuous action).

        The example SADISTI, however, meaning 'causing cruelty', is very
likely stored in our memory banks as a description .. so the adjective
"sadistic" might be the entry in our mental lexicon, because using this
concept decriptively is more basic than thinking of the abstract idea,
"sadism."  More by coincidence, I suspect, the -STI suffix can mean
"causing" or "causes."  So SADI-STI or SADISTI
could be ~glossed~ as <cruelty causing>.  Thus, SADI-STI-PE, or SADISTI-PE,
glosses well as <cruelty causing person>.

>I've noticed that there are several words in Glosa 6000 which refer
>to people, and end in -STI, and appear to be formed from a root word:
>SADI -> SADISTI, DENTI -> DENTISTI, JURNALI -> JURNALISTI, for examples.

>other words like this. For words like the other examples, I'd suggest
>that we drop the -STI words: DENTI -> DENTI-PE, JURNALI -> JURNALI-PE.
>
*       And again the -ISTI could be a "switch on" suffix.  The -I- might
just be the terminal vowel, leaving the -STI part to refer to the "switching
on" or "causing to come into being."  A JURNALI-PE causes the JURNALI to
come into being, so might legitemately be a JURNALI-STI, or a JURNALISTI.
Dentists, on the other hand, cause dentures, or bring them into being.
Whether all this was going on in the Clark/Ashby brain at the time of
vocabulary-building, I don't know, but there could have been some
serendipitous thinking occurring.

        If DIGITA .=. DAKTILI glosses as "digit (hand or foot)" then they
might be the Latin and Greek equivalents, and, thus, be seen as homonyms.

>We had...

*       This rationalisation seems correct, but the apparent synonyms could
appear on the same line:-
     DIGITA,DAKTILI,G. digit (finger or toe)

        Such inconsistencies are, I feel, par for the course.  The Glosa
authors did a very large job in hunting out their 6000 concept wordlist; and
while some of us might question some of the inclusions and omissions, the
rationalisations you suggest are legitemate at this Applications Research
stage of the language's development.  Perhaps suggestions for the inclusion
of additional words, EG computing terminologogy and some descriptive
linguistic terms, plus a hit list for removals - from "6000" - are also in
order at this 'Applications' stage of Glosa's development.
