    I do not know how much of a laughing stock Glosa would be if it
continued with the present system that lumps tense, aspect and mood
together ... and calls them particles.  It would be a lot easier for 99% of
the human population, as well.

*   The main thin is that the vast majority of people who know anything
about grammar have heard of tense, but do not know what "mood" and "aspect"
are.
    Calling it a "Verb Particle Table" would be honest, but a mouthful, and
somewhat confusing to the vast majority.

    I really can understand why Ron Clark wanted to leave the formalities
of grammar out of the story.  But I am sorry to say he vastly
underestimated the ability of people to jump into Glosa, and start using it
.. in such a way that the pattern would emerge with use.
    Another snippet of Glosa history: the way I learnt how to use Glosa was
by using it.  There was no Grammar Book then: there is none now.
Where, one wonders, is the courage that once made warriors into heros?
    There ent much of it about in the halls of Interlinguistics, anyway.

With Apologies,
 Robin G.

    What I am not sure about is whether the Formal Grammar-type terminology
that you are using is similarly ^hung up^ on Engish. 

    I do suspect that Glosa grammar far from being a cleaned up carbon copy
of English Grammar could be something quite different, and a medium of pure
communication .. or communication as pure as something as imperfect as the
human brain, can get it. 
 
    Although you havn't said it, I am suspecting that you have something
against the use of "has" and "had" as particles in English, possibly 
because they appear to mix the verbs "to have" and "to do". 

    has begun  - did start and is still going on; did continue to begin

    had begun  - did start, but is not going now; did cease to begin
               - did start, but is no longer starting now

 ???  Apart from the confusions of English that you dislike, and which
English-speakers use without knowing about all the rules they are breaking,
why not accompany you questions with ^trial sentences^ in Glosa???  

    Maybe I am asking the group to make positive comments about the way
meaning is, or can be, conveyed in Glosa.

    Say a person asks, how do you say this in Glosa, and a number of
Glosalistas put forward suggestions, then we will have something to work 
on.  I would ask people to try Glosa, even if they start with phrases.  If
you put the mental effort in, you will be able to grade up to sentences,
and one day, whole stories.

  is an English idiom relixified into Glosa; I thought it was an Adverbial
Phrase.  Still, I had thought that in any language, the logicality of ''and
so it follows'' [=that] was a necessity for clear thinking and logical
exposition.
    But trying hard, I wondered about the suitability of alternative Glosa
words:-
  ta forti KAUSA id frakto  [so hard causing it to break] 
  ta forti KA id frakto     [so hard because it breaks]*
  ta forti SEQE id frakto   [so hard and, as a consequence, it breaks]
  ta forti SO id frakto     [so hard, and thus it breaks]$
  ta forti ??? id frakto 
    OR is there a better structure, altogether, and if so, what?

    With commas, in English, it can be confusing if a series of them is
used in a sentence, with each comma having a different function; in Glosa,
where there are less textual clues, the "; = ,+" idea seems a worthwhile
innovation, to mark the introduction of a new clause.

*   As far as I have experienced it the number of true auxiliaries is less
than ten, ES, HABE, AKTI, GENE; and the verboids, which are usually used as
'helper 'verbs' is around twenty, POSI, POTE, NECE, DEBI, VOLU, 
SEQE, .... .   But, Glosa is not supposed to be classified to the ultimate
degree: this would be tantamount to rigidifying the language to the point
where the life(vitality) was squeezed out of it.  Some of the words which
can function as verboids are also able to function as verbs in their own
right, others not.  Many substantives, under the right circumstances, can
function as verboids.
    I would say that the essence of a word - the idea embued in it - is
part of SEMANTIC GRAMMAR, and not part of the syntactic analysis of the
language.  
    Here, in trying to force meaning into morphological structures, we are
erring in a way analogous to trying to force tense and aspect into 
PRA.  There probably should be lee-way in both areas; but trying to shape a
word because of its usual function seems, to me, to be getting away from
the original Glosa ethos.  If it works psychologically, as well as for the
computer, well and good; but, if an imposed CVCV structure feels
artificial, I believe it is wrong.

to be shorter than most substantives.  The words that glue together the
substance of what we want to say, are dealt with briefly, while the words
that have full semantic strength (substantial meaning) are the ones we
emphasise.
    But I am still of the impression that Glosa is supposed to be
naturalistic, with the feel of a normal human language.  Hence, I believe
that rigid rules will give the language a stilted feel.

    This is far, far better than trying to subsume all the connectives
under one, such as some counterpart to the egregiously overloaded
English "that."

    (By the way, it is looking more and more like my participation on
Glosalist may soon be coming to an end due to the time constraints of
upcoming employment.)

Robin,
	Saluta!
	I have given the matter of ";" vs "ke" some thought, and am going 
to stop doing so.  It is becoming very confusing!  PROVIDED THAT ";" has 
the meaning of introducing a clause AND is a definite stop, like a period 
(full stop), I think it can be retained.  I have to admit that I cannot 
come down heavily on either side.  A comma would merely add to the mess 
again.

I think you need the comma and/or some (any) conjunction;
KE is too valuable as a relativizer to use in that spot, IMO.

that, by contrast with what we are trying to do in Glosa, the general
standard of usage of English is quite 'sloppy'.
    This, and Paul's comments are what makes me wonder if we should not
come up with our own, appropriate terms to cover what happens in Glosa.
    And this, of course, begs the question: what really does happen in Glosa!?

    Thus, by circular argument, we come back to the starting point of
learning how to use Glosa, by using it.

    So, we come back to the question about the most suitable way to
describe Glosa's grammar, and the attempt to set this out in readable form.

    I will try soon, to catch up with an editing of my earlier SBG
(Syntax-based Grammar) posting, with ammendments as suggested by people on
this list.

    For those of us who are not up with the latest, can you please give
more details of how the newer, simple automated translation systems work.
    Such information would be helpful with the selection of lexemes for a
Machine-handlable subset of Glosa - or even for refining the full language.

    But I would like to understand more of the HOW, so that I can
understand the shape of the language that facilitates such a system.
    For example, had the DLT (Distributed Language Translation) project,
based on Esperanto, got closer to the nuts and bolts of the mechanics of
the process, I suspect that a more congruent Intermediate Language would
have been derived from Esperanto, and that the project would have been
flourishing to-day.  While, of course, I believe now, as I did then, that
the thing would have worked beautifully had the starting point been Glosa,
not Esperanto.

*   The DLT with Esperanto, is the closest anyone has come to trying Glosa
with a parser.  I have tried, in the past, to generate interest in the both
ideas: developing parsers for Glosa; and of seeing Glosa as a potential
"Middle Language" or 'meaning representation system', for translation.
But, what you are suggesting as a possibility is the closest we have come
to realisation of either of these ideas.

    But such thoughts smack of altruism, and generally lack a profit
motive.  I suspect that it will only be through 'not-for-profit' groupings
like Auxlang and Glosalist, that such broadly beneficial, though
non-exploitable, usages of computers will come.  
    So, go for it.  There could even be a ^buck in it^ for you, if you
retain copyright, and Glosa does become generalised.

     I found "jussive" and "optative" in the Glossary in the back of my
_Encyclopedia of Syntactic Theories_ but it hasn't done me much good.
     I suspect that we never did go out of our way to create special forms
for these.  Please suggest Glosa usages to convey these forms, if you feel
they should be in Glosa.  My understanding is that the 'simplicity' idea
acts against the introduction of special particles or auxiliaries for such
sophisticated moods in Glosa.

I would use "fini", or maybe "fin".
Auxiliaries almost always start out as regular verbs,
then get "semantically bleached" into particles.
The perfective really means the action is finished,
whether as of now or as of a past time.

"Fe PA gene u feli" ... She was getting (and possibly did get) a cat.
"Fe PA DU gene u feli" ... She was getting (in the act of) a cat.
"Fe PA FIN gene u feli" ... She did get (completely) a cat.
"Fe PA PRE-FIN gene u feli" ... She had already gotten a cat.

Or something like that. I don't like "NO-DURA" much,
but that looks like the status quo for completive aspect.
Lots of tricky "modals" are already in there already ...

    Best suggestion I have heard yet on the matter, although G.E.O.
materials seem to put a teleological twist on "fini" as having the 
meaning "end, aim."

    As I mentioned before, 'parato' seems a bit long for the usage.

    Conditional is a mood, not an aspect.

    I am not recommmending that anything be added as long as what needs
to be expressed can be expressed with what is available.

    I concur.

    We can say it, all right, but we seem not to -use- it the way you
Australians (and probably some Brits) use it.  I think it was George
Bernard Shaw (or somebody) who described Britain and the United States
as two countries separated by the same language.  Usage is not uniform
even among native speakers of a language as widely diffused as English. 
Pity the poor Canadians, drawn betwixt and between the U.S. and
Britain!

    I have to admit that these examples still have not clarified for me
the difference between 'se' and 'auto'.

*   So, Please find a language in which "tense, aspect, mood, and voice"
are separate, and jot down, in *Whatever*, the various instances, of the
above characteristics, that you imagine relevant to an IAL.
    And for those of us who are 'monoglot', with English as our only
natlang, would you please give English-language renditions of the gist of
the meanings of the *Whatever* instances.

    Then, those of us who are keen to see the Net Glosa idea ^wrapped up^,
will have something to work on - so we can reach a conclusion on this
"particles-before-the-verb" situation.

    I imagine that we need to agree on the range of instances per
characteristic, and then on the suitability of lexemes for the various
positions, before we can be happy with making genuine additions to the
language.  Selling such ideas to the authors may be another matter.

    Before I am happy with something I write in Glosa, it has to pass the
"tongue test": when I say it, it feels comfortable; and correspondingly,
when I hear what I have said, it sounds good.
    I believe that any such proposed ammendments to Glosa would need to
pass the "tongue test" also, before we suggest them to Glosa Central.

  Robin G.

    It may look funny,and even ugly, but does help define the syntax in a
language in which the syntax defines the grammar.

    My natural feeling is that a Noun Clause is an 'object', and, as such
warrants a colon.  However, if this is not a common belief, I feel that the
semicolon is a worthwhile compromise, and I prefer to stick with it.

    The resurrection of, the Old Glosa, ~ke~, on the other hand is another
matter.  English speakers are used to having such a function-word at the
start of Noun Clauses and Adverbial Clauses, and if possible, I feel it
should be retained.

    On looking in the Latin dictionary, I find:-

     <italic>finio  </italic>to limit, bound, enclose

     <italic>finitus  </italic>limited, restricted, rhythmical

     <italic>finis  </italic>boundary, limit, border  {Q. Did the Latin
appear in italic?} 


    So, if ~fini~ = end, finish

           ~fin~  can be the perfective particle 


    I use ~buta~ [butt,aim,purpose] to mean "end" (objective).


Saluta,

 Robin G.

   P.S.  The ~parato~ [already] I suggested as a possible 'perfective',
is quite a good, legitimate word in its own right, and probably should be
in the lexicon.  At present, it is Old Glosa, and has possibly been
?superceded? by another word.

    I'd like to ^call uncle^ here, and wish to invoke the "Elision Rule".
    If the dictum of >punctuate only when necessary for clarity< applied,
as it seems to do in English, then I would find the solution of this
conundrum easier.
    You like the clean lines of a sentence that runs on .. without the
interruption of (unnecessary) punctuation; I am thinking of the worst case
scenario, where an absence of punctuation makes life difficult for the reader.
    So, as far as I am concerned, people should have the freedom to operate
their language within reasonable limits: from 'verbose' to 'maximum
elision'.  If this situation applied, then we would be both right: me using
the unnecessary verbose form; and, you using elision.

    If, when expressing myself in English, I did hit something so hard that
it broke, I would have to stop and think before being able to express the
same thing using something other than "that".

Home work for to-day.
  Express the following in Glosa:-
 a.   It was so hot that it burnt him.
 b.   He walked so fast that he fell.
 c.   She talked so loudly that my ears hurt.

>Lots of tricky "modals" are already in there already ...

*   Aha!  On looking in the _Collins Cobuild English Grammar_ p 217,
section 4.95, I find "Using Modals".

    And I quote:


    " .....  using a set of verbs called <bold>modals</bold>.  Modals are
always

    used with other verbs.  They are a special kind of <bold>auxiliary

    verb.

</bold>

    Here is a list of the modals used in English:

     ____________________________________________________

    |                                                    |

    |   can         might         shall        would     | 

    |   could       must          should                 | 

    |   may         ought to      will                   |

    |____________________________________________________| " 


   So, these, I have previously called "verboids".  Maybe I should get
into line with Functional Grammar, and describe them as "modals".


   In Glosa the list looks like:-

    pote  [can]    nece  [must]      sio  [would]

    posi  [may]    debi  [ought to] 


    sio debi  [should]

    sio pote  [could]

    sio posi  [might]

    sio nece  [must]


    veri  [will,shall] {=truly}

Commas are OK with me, but I definitely want the "KE".
Even in English, a "which/that" to start a clause is welcome.
Those semicolons of Glosa will turn into commas, I predict,
in actual common use; so I'll cease complaining about them.

>> >> 4. so hard that it broke -   ta forti KE id frakto  .... AdvC     

The word "hardness" applies more to objects than actions,
so I still object to using "hard" instead of "forceful",
especially in the same phrase with "broke". It's poor idiom.

> a.   It was so hot that it burnt him.

"KA id habe ta termo, SO id kausti an."

I just noticed KA in the vocab.  At least it isn't exactly KE.
I don't know which is better, or when to use one or the other.
I would use SO in all the examples ...

Relative clause introducer, only. "Keep it simple."

It isn't enough. In free speech, people often pause and re-state.
We need to use the "KE" and other conjunctions to be explicit.
Adding some pauses and commas doesn't hurt though.

here, on day to day communication, and it is still my considered opinion

It isn't ANY tense. The authors seem to have imported
the English *idea* that "unmarked" tense == "present",
yet we do not even use English that way. Our "present"
can be timeless or habitual or past or future. To me,
unless the NU particle is used, it isn't present tense.

"Pa-di, id kausti an" ... surely this is more acceptable
than "Pa-di, id pa kausti an". And without the "pa-di",
context would most likely indicate the time of the event.

*   Well, if a language uses NO marking of Tense as a 'default' to the
Present, I see no harm in it ... and just because the English (or more
likely the Americans) make a mess of it, there is no reason that we, in
Glosa, should do the same.
  "I goes into this bar: I see this beautiful brunette. I order her a
beer." - pure Mickey Spillane, nothing to do with the Brits or us in Oz.

   When Paul Bartlett was with us, he was always chiding me for my
"punctillious" use of Tense Particles.
   If it was Past, I used ~pa~ before every 'verb'.  And Not a bad rule
either!

 I?E?  I went home, get some food and eat it.          (~=2)

  -->1.  Mi pa ki a domi; pa gene sito, e pa fago id.
OR
  -->2.  Mi pa ki a domi; gene sito, e fago id.

AND ??
        I went home, got some food, and ate it.         (~=1)

 N.B. The English-language version of  2.  sounds funny, but that was what
Paul demanded, in the Glosa!!!

 I*E*  Mi nu ki a domi; nu greso peri, id e nu fosi intra u jardina.(->3)

       Mi ki a domi; greso peri id, e fosi intra u jardina.        (->4)

       Now I go home, walk around it, and dig in the garden.    (~=3)
       
       I go home, walk around it, and dig in the garden.       (~=4)


I believe that Glosa versions  ->2 & ->4  pass the "tongue/ear test".

 Glosa  ->1  does sound a bit heavy, but it is consistent.

 Glosa  ->3  is too heavy, altogether.

Please ponder on it: I'd like to hear Glosalista's opinions on this, thanks. 

>"Pa-di, id kausti an" ... surely this is more acceptable
>than "Pa-di, id pa kausti an". And without the "pa-di",

>
*   Yes, I now see the sense (and psycholinguistics) of 

       Pa-di, id kausti an  
BUT
   It still translates directly to      Yesterday, it burn him

   So we have no alternative but to say that Glosa and English form tenses,
in a sentence, DIFFERENTLY.

PPS. I am aware that a general Glosa instruction book will move slower than
these exercises - increasing in complexity more gradually.  However, I am
hoping that, for subscribers to this List, such a pace would be too slow;
if this is not the case, and I am asking you to progress with the language
faster than is reasonable, please let me know.   R.G.

1. Overview
  #1 Derivation of Language Characteristics
    . Vocabulary is from the Classical roots of Greek & Latin
    . Pronunciation - Five Vowels of Italian & Spanish
    . Sentence structure - Similar to English
    . Words are Concept Centres - Based on Chinese
  #2 Words Don't Change With Use
    . Words do not have Gender.
    . Words do not Agree in Number.
    . The same word, unchanged, can function as noun, verb, or modifier.
    . 'Verbs' have no inflections.
    . 'Nouns' do not change to form the plural.
  #3 No Part-of-Speech Markers
    . A word is not changed to form a different part of speech.
    . A word's functioning as a particular Part-of-Speech is indicated by 
      its position in the sentence.
  #4 Precedence Rule Creates Syntax
    . One word modifies the next, and so on.
    . Phrase starts with least significant word, ends in most significant.
    . There is an order for placing words (least to most sig.) in a phrase. 
    . Precedence combines with Subject-Verb-Object order and clause
      structure to produce syntax.

2. Basic Structure
  A. Words
    i. These are symbols for ideas, and are the atoms of language, but are
       of little meaning, singly.
   ii. There are two major groups of words:-
      a)Primitives: comprising a small number of basic function words -
        present in all languages - these allow us to describe the
        relationships between the major concepts we convey, EG de [of], 
        e [and], pre [before], qe [-> ?], supra [above].   
      b)Substantives: the ever-expanding list of words representing things,
        actions and descriptions (sometimes usable for all three), EG 
        kurso [run], vide [see], via [road], oku [eye], hedo [happy], 
        celera [swift].
  iii. Consonant vowel (CV, CVCV, etc) structure for ease of pronunciation:
       this pattern is the general trend, not a rigidly imposed rule.
   iv. Formation of new words could be by adding completely new words, but 
       is usually through compounding, with hyphens, of unchanged existing
       words.
  B. Phrases
    i. A phrase is the smallest unit of Glosa to have recognisable meaning.
   ii. There are four main phrases, depending on their function within
        the sentence:-
      a)Noun Phrase: small group with a 'noun' preceded by descriptive words. 
      b)Verb Phrase: small group with a 'verb' preceded by its modifiers.
      c)Prepositional Phrase: preposition plus a Noun Phrase; can be an
        "Indirect Object" to the 'verb'. 
      d)Adverbial Phrase: small group with a modifier, amplifying the 
        meaning of the 'verb'; can be one word at the start or end of   the
        sentence. 
  iii. Phrases in a simple sentence follow the Subject+Verb(+Object) 
        pattern, with:-
      a)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase ... with Intransitive 'verb'.
      b)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Noun Phrase ... Transitive 'verb'.
      c)Noun Phrase+Verb Phrase+Prepositional Phrase .. 'verb' has Indirect
        Object.
   iv. Glosa phrases are "Substantive Final", starting with the least 
       important word, and followed by additional words combining progress-
       ively to extend the meaning of the substantive, which comes last.
  C. Clauses
     i. A Glosa sentence with only one 'verb' is a Major Clause.
    ii. With two, or more 'verbs' in a sentence, there is one Major clause,
        with the other 'verb(s)' usually in Minor Clauses that add meaning 
        to the Major Clause.
   iii. Two, or more, Major Clauses may be combined in a sentence through
        the use of one, or more, conjunctions.
    iv. Where ambiguity is otherwise possible, a semi-colon is used as a
        Start-of-Clause Marker.
     v. There are three types of Minor Clause in Glosa:-
       a)Noun Clause: larger group that takes the place of a Noun Phrase.  
       b)Adjectival Clause: larger group usually starting with the Relative 
         Pronoun, ~qi~, and following the 'noun' it adds meaning to.
       c)Adverbial Clause: larger group, that could be anywhere in the
         sentence, but which extends the meaning of the main verb of the
         sentence.  These start with a word that places or explains  the
         action of the 'verb' they qualify, examples: time ~kron~ [when],
         location ~loka~ [where], spacial ~dia~ [through],
         logical ~anti-co~ [however], causal ~te~ [in order to].
  D. Sentence
     The minimum meaningful group within Glosa: it starts with a capital 
     letter and ends with a full stop or equivalent.           

3. Function Words 
  E. Noun Markers
    i. Indicating the start of a Noun Phrase, particles are placed in front 
       of numerators and other modifiers that come before the 'noun'.
   ii. The particle indicates whether the 'noun' is Singular or Plural:
      a)~u~ is the particle for singular 'nouns', and
      b)~plu~ is the particle for plural 'nouns'. 
  F. Prepositions
    i. Small words that give information about a following Noun Phrase or
       Adverbial Clause:
      a)Time: tem [at the time], po [after], pre [before], kron [when].
      b)Place: lo [where], to [at], ab [away].  
      c)Relationship: epi [on], in [into], intra [inside], a [towards],
       infra [under], supra [over], inter [between], ex[out of],
       tele [far], proxi [near].  
   ii. Small words that introduce an Advebial Clause: 
       so [thus], ka [because], sine [instead of], te [in order to]
  G. Modifiers
     Words placed before a substantive to amplify its meaning; they are 
     usually substantives too, but they add meaning to the final word in 
     the phrase.
    i. Without changing, the same word can modify a 'noun'(being called an
       adjective) or a 'verb'(and be called an adverb).
   ii. In Noun Phrases, there are also modifiers of Number, Quantity & 
       Quality, that are paced after the Noun Marker but before the 'noun'.   
  H. Other Functions
    i. Conjunctions
       These join equivalent units within the sentence: words, phrases or 
       clauses:-
      a)Combination: e [and]
      b)Opposition: sed [but]
      c)Alternative: alo [or]  
      d)Binary Alternative: alo X alo Y [either X or Y]
   ii. Negatives
       Placed before the substantive these negate its meaning:
      a)Nouns: nuli [no,nothing] 
      b)Verbs: ne [do not .. ], no- [un-...]
      c)Binary Negatives: ni P ni Q [neither P nor Q]
  iii. Questions
      a)The placing of ~qe~ before a statement makes it a question.
      b)~qo?~ [what?] 
      c)~qo-~ is used to form compound question words: qo-lo [where],
       qo-tem [when], qo-te [why,what intention], qo-mode [how], qo-pe [who]
   iv. Generic Terms
       Two-letter abbreviations of substantives can be added, using hyphens, 
       as terminal affixes, to change the category of a word: there are about
       twenty of these. 
        EG post [mail], persona [person], posta-pe [postman]
    v. Reflexive Forms
       The action of the 'verb' is received by the Subject of the clause. 
      a)Where the Subject is a person, ~auto~ is placed after the 'verb',
         EG An bate auto. [He hit himself.]
      b)For impersonal Subjects, ~se~, or ~-se~ is put after the 'verb'.
    
         EG U makina pa frakto-se. [The machine broke itself.]
4. Substantives
  I. Concept Words
     In Glosa each concept is conveyed by one word, and it can function,
     unchanged, as a noun, verb or modifier, depending on its position in
     the sentence.  These make up the majority of the lexicon, and all new 
     word for objects, action or descriptions, are substantives.

Hello Again,
  Here's the second half of the Ver.2 Glosa Grammar.   R.G.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Noun Phrases
  J. Substantive as 'noun'
     A simple sentence has two Noun Phrases, one for Subject the other for
     Object.  The final word in a NP is a substantive acting as a noun.
   i. A single 'noun' can constitute a Noun Phrase.
  ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of determinants and modifiers,
      as well as the final substantive 'noun' in a Noun Phrase. 
  K. Pronouns    
     These take the place of substantives, and represent them, acting in 
     every way like the full 'noun'.
   i. Personal Pronouns represent people:
     a)First person: mi [I], na [we]
     b)Second Person: tu [you(singular)], vi [you(plural)]
     c)Third Person: an [he], fe [she], pe [a person], mu [them]
  ii. Impersonal Pronouns: u-ci [this], u-la [that]
 iii. Relative Pronoun (Adjectival Clause Marker): qi [which,that]
  L. Determinants and Numerators
     These are particles that tell about the quantitative nature of the 
     'noun', and are placed at the start of the Noun Phrase. 
   i. Noun Markers: u [=a,the], plu [=the](indicates plurality); these 
      can be omitted, if context, or other words in the NP, clearly 
      indicate the presence of the 'noun'
  ii. Countables
      Countables exist in discrete numbers, and may be described using:
     a)Numbers: mo [one], bi [two], deka [ten], bi-tri [twenty-three].
     b)General terms: oligo [few], poly [many], mega, [big], pusi [small].
      plura [several], 
 iii. Quantifiers 
      Substances that are Measured, not Counted, are described using:
      u mero de [a piece of], ma [more], meio [less], maxi [most],
      u qantita de [an amount of]. 
  M. Noun Modifiers
     Substantives functioning as nouns may be modifies qualitatively by 
     other substantives placed directly before them.
    i. Adjectives: This is the traditional term for Noun Modifiers.
   ii. Compounding: When two, or more, substantives combine, often 
       hyphenated, to form one complex concept, they modify the meaning of
       one another.
        EG trans-natio-korporati [TNC]

6. Verb Phrases
     A simple sentence has one Verb Phrase in the middle of the sentence:
     the final word in a V.P. is a substantive acting as a verb.
   i. A single 'verb' can constitute a Verb Phrase.
  ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of particles and modifiers,
      as well as the final substantive 'verb', in a Verb Phrase. 
  N. Substantive as 'verb'
     In a V.P. one substantive functions as the verb.
    i. The 'verb' represents the action associated with the substantive.
   ii. The substantive is not modified to show that it acts as a verb.
  iii. 'verbs' in Glosa are not inflected.
   iv. The substantive 'verb' is the final word in the V.P. being 
       preceded in the phrase by particles and modifiers.
  O. Auxiliary Verbs
     These substantive - capable of acting as verbs on their own - precede
     the main 'verb' and augment its meaning.  These are: es [being,is],
     habe [has_the_quality_of,"is"], gene [gets,becomes,"is"].
  P. Modal Verbs
     These are lesser 'verbs' that usually precede the main 'verb'
     modifying how it acts.  These are: posi [possibly], pote [can],
     debi [ought to], nece [must], probabili [probably]. 
  Q. Phrasal Verbs
     A Phrasal Verb comprises a substantive 'verb' followed by one (or
     more) "post-positions" that extend the meaning of the 'verb'.
      EG,  ki ana  [go up], moti ab  [move away from], loka antero [put
         in front of]
  R. Verb Modifiers
     The 'verb'is the final word in the V.P., and any word before the 
     substantive 'verb' modifies that 'verb'. The modifiers in a V.P. 
     follow a sequence of increasing importance to the meaning of the 
     phrase:- 
        Tense - Aspect - Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive   
    i. Tense Particles
       Strictly speaking there are two Tense particles:-
        pa - Past Tense
        -    Present Tense
        fu - Future Tense
        The default for a 'verb' not marked for tense is Present Tense. 
   ii. Aspect Particles
       A number of other words relating to the timing or intention of the
       action can come after the Tense particle to extend the expresion of
       the 'verb':-
         nu - immediate present
         sio - would .. if  (conditional)
         du - continues  (continuous)
         fin - completed  (perfective)
  iii. Modifiers(Adverbs)
       These are substantives that describe the action,
         EG forti [strongly], celero [quickly], sine sono [silently].
   iv. Verb as Noun (Gerund)
       A Substantive may represent the action, but be in the position of
       a noun: here the Substantive has the qualities of both verb and 
       noun, and is called a Gerund; a Noun Marker (u/plu) is used to clarify 
       the syntax, if necessary, EG
        An hedo kurso. [He likes running/to run.], 
        Fe kanto es fo boni. [Her singing is very good.]
        U ju-an interese es u vola de plu modela aeroplana.
         [The boy's interest is flying model aeroplanes.] 
     v. Verb as Adjective (Participle)
        When a Verb is used to modify a Noun, the prefix ~ge-~ is placed in 
        front of the Verb to indicate that the action is received by the 
        second word, IE ge-X Y  ... where X and Y are substantives,
         EG  u ge-klude tira  [the closed door]. 
    vi. Subject and Object reversed (Passive voice)
        To form Passive Voice in Glosa, the Main Verb is converted into a
        participle, and is preceded by an Auxiliary Verb; the "actor" 
        follows the Verb Phrase as an "Indirect Subject", IE
        "recipient"(Obj.)-Auxiliary-Participle-Preposition-"actor"(Subj.)
         EG  andra           es      ge-morda      ex        kani
          ... Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.
         The Auxiliary Verb can be ~es~ [is] or ~gene~ [gets].    

7. Syntax
    The definition of syntax used for Glosa is "word order".
  S. Precedence
     Words in phrases are sequential, and there is an order of precedence
     of words in phrases, of phrases in a clause, and clauses in a 
     sentence.
    i. Precedence Rule
       This states that, within a phrase, a word is modified by the word
       immediately preceding it.  The modifying effect is cumulative 
       throughout the phrase, with the meaning of the final substantive
       being qualified addatively by all of the words preceding it in the 
       phrase.
   ii. Sequence in Phrases
      a)Noun Phrases
        Noun - Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifier(s) - 'noun'
        Marker
         EG. u   plura       tri-loba       mega      alti, rubi    flori 
      b)Verb Phrases
        Tense - Aspect  -  Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
        Part.   Part.(s)    Verb      Verb                      Verb
        EG. pa   sio        posi       es         forti         hedo
  T. Sentence Order (SVO)
     Glosa follows the majority sequence, of subject-verb-object, in the 
     structuring of its sentences.  As with English, on which Glosa 
     sentence structure is modelled, there are variations on this theme:-
   i. SV: subject-verb (intransitive 'verb'), EG  An kurso.
  ii. SVd: subject-verb-dependent_phrase, EG  Fe dice fo celero.
 iii. SVO: subject-verb-object (transitive 'verb'), EG U kani morda an.
  iv. SViO: subject-verb-indirect_object, EG Fe ki ad u boteka. 
   v. OVS: object-is_verbed_by-subject EG U kani es ge-bate ex un andra.
  U. Compounds
     Although words in Glosa do not change through usage, to generate new
     concepts, two, or more, substantives may be grouped to form a 
     compound word, and such compounds are usually joined with a hyphen.  
   i. Normal compounds are formed from two or more full substantives, EG
      kryso-buklas [golden curls,"Goldilocks"], moli-centra [soft-centered].
  ii. Regularly compounded words are abbreviated to two-letter forms, 
      called "Generic Terms", that are affixed with hyphens to the preced-
      ing substantive word, EG -do (domi)[house], kani-do [dog-house];
      -bo (boteka)[shop], pani-bo [bread shop,baker's].
  V. Concept Clusters
     Some very complex things and actions require, for their description, 
     the adjacent placement of three, or more, substantive words; however,
     this "clustering of concepts" is to be avoided, where possible, in 
     Glosa.  EG  u televideo cyklo undu genera-me
                [a television cyclic wave generator]  ... would be better
     described as ... u genera-me de cyklo undu pro televideo
                     [a generator of cyclic waves for television]. 

8. Punctuation
   Represents, in written form, the normal pauses and inflections of
   speech; and, as required (to avoid ambiguity) indicates the beginning
   of a new syntactic group.     
  W. Comma
      a)Pauses within phrase
      b)Separating equvalent syntactic elments in a phrase
      c)Pauses between phrases
      d)Separating clauses joined with a conjunction        
      e)Introducing a new phrase, where this avoids ambiguity
      f)As parenthesis for brief additional information within a phrase
  X. Semi-colon
      a)Separating equivalent clauses in a sentence
      b)Pauses between clauses
      c)Introducing a new clause, where this avoids ambiguity
  Y. Other
    i. Colon    
      a)Introducing a list comprising equivalent clauses
      b)Following a clause to indicate a consequence 
   ii. Exclamation Mark
       At the end of a sentence to add emphasis or indicates surprise.
  iii. Question Mark
       At the end of a sentence indicating the asking of a question. 
   iv. Quotation Marks 
      a)Double quotes (") around
         . Direct Speech
         . Quotations from text
         . specialised terminology
         . book titles (Alternative use on Internet: underlining _Xxx_)
                       (Alternative use in printed texts: Italics)
      b)Single quotes (') around
         . Direct Speech quoted within other Direct Speech
         . literary reference
         . special use of terminology for emphasis
    v. em dash ( - ) pauses for additional information
         . around additional information inserted as a clause
         . as a single dash for additional information at the end of the
            sentence
   vi. Brackets (xxxx xx) around
         . alternative wording
         . special explanation
         . additional information not part of the syntax of the sentence
  vii. Idiom and metaphor
       For clarity of expression across cultural boundaries these should
       be avoided in Auxiliary Language usage; however, where it is 
       necessary - for literary purposes - to quote a national-language
       idiom within Glosa, then such non-literal language ought to be
       marked with some 'neutral' symbol, EG pluvi ^plu feli e kani^.
       
9. Pronunciation
   This follows the generalised pattern of European usage. 
  Z. Phonetic Rule
     Each letter has one associated pronunciation.
     N.B. This is not automatically reversible, EG ~q~ sounds like /kw/.
  &. Vowels
     The five vowels of Glosa have Italian (or Spanish) pronunciation:
     a - AH, e - AY, i - EE, o - OR, u - OO.
 &&. Consonants 
     These follow the general pronunciation within Europe, but, where 
     consonants have alternative pronunciations, the "hard"
     pronunciation is used (g, h, j, s, z).  c is pronounced CH; y as ~i~;
     x as /ks/; w is not used; and there is no letter carrying the
     "soft" g, or "soft" j, sound.
