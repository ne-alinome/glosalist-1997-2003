Hurrah! 

Both Aaron and Paul had trouble downloading my dictionary files. And then,
coincidentally, the same weekend, I got an email from somebody who had been
unable to download my Doom files.

I had the links defined like this...

   href="ftp:filename.exe"


...which should have worked. It did before! And it is the proper
format, and I have some much older pages which use it. But sure
enough, it didn't work for me anymore either! I've "upgraded" (yeah,
right, "upgraded", teeheehee) my browser since then. Well, the ftp:
is *supposed* to tell the browser to download the file. But nowadays
broswers are also likely to check the file extension and try to decide
for themselves what to do, no matter what you tell them.

Actually, the ftp: form does work for .zip files. In fact, just about
any combination worked for zips. The exe files were the problem. At home
I use Internet Explorer 3, and at work Netscape Navigator. Also at work
we have Internet Explorer 2. And I could not find a combination of things
that would work for all three! I kept thinking that it must be an improper
configuration.

But the fault may actually be with my ISP. Today I found an exe file, a
self-extracting file, at the garbo site in Finland, and the link was defined
exactly like my original version. And it worked just fine! So I moved the
files over to my site on xoom.com along with a test page using the original
links, and it worked!

So I left the files on xoom and linked to them there. If anybody wants
to try the new version, let me know how it goes.

BKZIP? Tell me more! Are you familiar with INFOZIP? It's a freeware
project that's compatible with pkzip (although the commandline switches
are a little bit different, and it saves/restores directory structures
by default (opposite of pkzip) ), but what's really cool is that it runs
under many different operating systems. Handy for me, because I use
DOS/WINDOWS/NT and Unix.

    Thanks for the reference.  Although, as you mentioned, the
Glosa reference was not precisely on target, it was at least
not too bad.  I noticed that there was a reference to
Jeffrey(sp?) Henning's Model Languages page.  I had not looked
at it in a long time, and I see that he has a link to frater2,
a project I was once working on but have done nothing with in a
long time.  It was a modification of FRATER, a somewhat
Glosa-like language by a Vietnamese, published in 1957:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/frater2.html

(I never got around to finishing the vocabulary.  I did quite a
bit in the language description, however.)

*	My suggestion to all potential Glosa aficionados, is to think in Glosa.
While you are ^juggling^ the Glosa words in your head, re-arrange them so
that ^when they fall^, they produce well-formed Glosa sentences.  The
situation becomes rather unworkable when you think in English, compose
satisfatory sentences in English, and then procede to translate these
English-language originals into Glosa.
	The Glosa authors welcome items for the periodical "Plu Glosa Nota"  from
beginners, and they will happily edit such articles into good Glosa.
Netters should send items to  glosauk{at}cix{dot}compulink{dot}co{dot}uk  .
	To recieve a sample copy of P.G.N. send your pidgeon post details to the
authors, and they will forward you one: unfortunately, they wish normal
commercial conditions to apply, and they need to get a subscription to the
periodical to be able to send out further copies.

 Robin

*	Hi Aaron,
I will agree that written Glosa gets more attention than the spoken form,
but the way the Glosa pronunciation was arrived at, possibly needs some
explanation.
	In a word, the authors went Italian.  At least as far as the vowels go,
they said the five vowels of Glosa had the same five pronunciations as the
vowels of Italian.  And for "C", they carried the trend, in Italian, for
"-ci-" and "-ce-" to have the English "ch" sound, on to the othe vowels.  I
hope you can follow their logic on this: all "cVOWEL" forms in Glosa have
the "c" pronounced as "ch" in English.  
	I went to my local library to borrow a "teach yourself Italian" cassette
to check out my Glosa pronunciation against that on the cassette. This
would be the most practical way of getting the Glosa vowels.  When Ron
Clark was teaching me the A, E, I, O, U of Italian, I was struck by the
fact that the last two vowels were formed differently from their normal
soundings in English: for both "O" and "U", he projected his lips forward
in a rather non-English sort of way.

>is "o" a pure short o, or does it really have an r!  any hint of a "w"
>sound?
*	When you say, "Pass me some more bread," you do not actually sound the
"R" in the "-ore", but it is 'felt.'  This is the "o" of Italian and Glosa.
 There is no "w" hinted.

>is "e" a pure e (like Esperanto) or is it diphthongised (like English)?
*	Neither.  The "e" of Italian and Glosa sound like the long "A" of
English, which is a diphthongised "a": hence my rendition of it as "AY".

>is "j" always like 'you' never like 'jet'?
*	True.  I wonder if something significant has been lost with the absence
of the 'hard "J"' which I see also as the 'soft"G"'.

>is "y" really used in modern Glosa, or does "i" always replace it?
*	It was originally there, but now has been completely replaced by "I";
this represents a standardisation.

>is "x" always ks, for example is xilo always like ksilo never like zilo?
*	The semi-phoneticisation in Glosa has each letter with only one
pronunciation: Glosa "x" and "z" being different letters have different
pronunciations .. one each!  Yes, the Glosa "x" is pronounced as "ks'.

>is "z" a voiced "s" (the international value) or is it "ts" or is it
>"dz"?
*	I'd go for the 'international' voiced "s"'.  But it is so rare in Glosa
that I use it very infrequently.  

>are diphthongs really avoided in practice (for example is auxi always
>a-oo-ksi or does aubreve-ksi creep in)?
>another example, is baia always ba-ee-a or does ba-ya occur?
*	Very tricky question.  Having adjacent vowels is purposely avoided in
Glosa, where possible.  Each vowel is supposed to be sounded separately,
according to the rule of Glosa's semi-phoneticisation.  But people are
people, and will take short cuts: what is the shortest distance between two
vowels?
	In the two examples you gave, classical Glosa gives each vowel its own
pronunciation.  Using Gaskell symbols, they are: AH-OO'ksEE and bAH-EE-AH.

	I understand that the authors sell a demonstration cassette of spoken
Glosa: I have threatened to create a set of conversation cassettes, but am
moving very slowly on the plan.

quite different, like Esperanto's "ri", would be a better bet.  However, in
English we have muddled through for centuries without this pronoun; it is
only now, with Political Correctness, that "he/she" or "heesh" has been
foist upon us, but still there is no "him/her" or "hir".  Obviously Glosa
could have a third person singular pronoun, but this is more likely to be
added at the time of IAL adoption, or afterwards, than as a priority for
the author's promotion of the language.  R.G.

    Correct me if I am wrong, but it has been my understanding from
the very beginning that 'pe' is usable as a sex-neutral pronoun.

    But my complaint, if you will, is that the language is not
consistent enough to induce me to put much effort into it "as it now
exists."  To be sure, we must avoid the trap of "tinkering" and ever
striving for a "perfection" which does not exist.  At the same time,
nearly every constructed auxlang goes through a developmental period. 

    Zamenhof experimented with various schemes before he published
Esperanto in 1887.  Different schemes were worked over before
Interlingua was published in 1951.  Lojban went through development
before it was baselined not too long ago.  There were at least three
editions of Russell's Suma.  And so on.  My position is that if Glosa
has been baselined, then it was so too soon and left with too many
inconsistencies.

    To be sure, there needs to be discerning judgment to decide that a
language is in good enough condition that further adjustment my not be
suitable.  I suppose I may differ in that judgment on the current state
of Glosa.

I came across frater2 some time ago, before I got involved with Glosa,
so the connection with Interglossa/Glosa didn't sink in. I see that you
integrated elements of Interglossa with frater2, and say that frater
is glosalike; was frater itself influenced by Interglossa or was the
similarity coincidental, since the authors of both languages were
approaching the task with similar ideas in mind?

Are there elements of frater and frater2 which could be used to
enhance Glosa?

    The author of FRATER merely said that he was influenced by Bodmer's
"The Loom of Language."  However, Hogben was the "editor" of "The
Loom," and I really don't know how much was Bodmer's and how much
Hogben's.  There was not mention of _direct_ influence from Hogben as
such.

> Are there elements of frater and frater2 which could be used to

    I would tend to doubt it.  I developed the grammar description of
frater2 way beyond that of FRATER, although the latter was the base for
the former.  Also, the grammar of frater2 seems to be much more
elaborate than the implicit grammar of Glosa.  (I did not want to leave
things ambiguous.)  Because both languages have a much more restricted
phonology that Glosa, there is even more deformation of roots than with
Glosa.  At this point I am not really in favor of "changing" Glosa; I
would just like to see more consistency, more optimal word selection,
and better presentation.

**	True, I did slip up here.  The correct version is "Id gene ge-vide ex un
andra.".  The English "seen" is a participle: I should have used the
participle form ( ge-vide ) not the infinitive form ( vide ).
*	This is annoyingly the only bit of Glosa that can be described as
"morphological" grammar.  The authors claim that Glosa should be in the
active voice ... but, because some people really need to invoke the
participle, and use the passive voice, then they created the
clumsy-appearing form: " ... gene ge-X .." where "X" is a substantive word
functioning as a verb.

	The glos is something like:-
  ... gene ge-X
     gets got-X-ed  ...... this 'got-X-ed' bit is the (past) participle, IE
functionally an adjectival form modifying the subject of the sentence.
Participles, being what they are, can, in English, have some of the
qualities of an adverb .. modifying "get" in this case (or the "gene" in
Glosa).  However, because I do enjoy using the passive voice - in both
English and Glosa - I decided to go along with this 'exception' to the "in
Glosa, no word is changed for reason of grammar" rule.   [NB The "ge-" of
Glosa is almost equivalent to an "-ed" in English - for participles.]

EG  Un andra vide u kani.  ........  U kani gene ge-vide ex un andra.
..  the man  sees the dog   ......  the dog gets (got)seen by the man 

..  Un andra bate u kani.  ........  U kani gene ge-bate ex un andra.      
..  the man hits the dog  ........  the dog gets (got)hit by the man

..  Fe klude u fenestra.  .........  U fenestra gene ge-klude ex fe.
.. she closes the window  .........  the window gets (got)closed by her

I wish to stress that in Glosa the form is always the same, but in English
we have inherited numerous ways of forming the participle, and it may even
stay the same as the infinitive.  There is always a verb before the
participle: "gene" in Glosa; and "is", "gets", etc in English.

The matter of tense becomes delightfully confused, in English, when we try
to tease out just whose "-ed" it is: sometimes the "-ed" tells us we have a
participle, sometimes it tells us about past tense, and at other time it
covers both.  Obviously, in Glosa, the authors attempted to standardise the
patterns for the formation of both tense and voice. 
    NB We really have tried to avoid translating Glosa word for word from
English, and have sought regularisation within the language.  Having said
all that, it is possible to use the 'glos' form to replace Glosa words with
English ones, and still come up with a fairly meaningful sequence of words.
     
>vide means seeing (adj), to see (verb), the see-er (noun), and? the act of
>seeing (noun),
*	Not so fast.  I think you have the ^tail by the dog^.
Back to basics: in Glosa, WITHIN REASON, the substantive can function as
any part of speech; we could perhaps have "vide andra" [seeing man], "ki
vide id" [goes to see it], "fe vide an" [she sees him], u vide [a/the
see(ing)].  But, perhaps the verb "to see" is one in which it is not
reasonable to force all of the possible functions; maybe there are better
lexemes for these functions, EG "vista" [view], "skope" [look at].
	However, it is rational to think of some concepts as more related to
actions (natural verbs) and others more related to things (natural nouns),
and the same has to be true of Glosa, also.  In English we use "see" more
as a verb than a noun.  The same is true of Glosa: it is natural to think
of "vide" as having more of the qualities of a verb than a noun.  
	So, it is best to start with the infinitive as the 'pure' form of the
verb: "Vide!" (imperative), "An pa ki vide id." [He went to see it.]; but
we can add tense "Fe pa vide id" [She saw it.], "Tosto, un avi fu vide id."
[Soon, the bird will see it.], or "John nu vide id" [John is now seeing
it.], and even "Po vide id, an pa kurso." [After seeing it, he ran.]; but
we can get onto sticky ground when we try for the gerund "Mi amo mi plu
okula, ka mi hedo vide." [I like my eyes because I enjoy seeing.].  As you
can imagine, there is no difference in Glosa between " .. mi hedo vide." [
.. I enjoy seeing.] and " .. mi hedo vide." [ .. I like to see.].

	But, of course, we have *seeing* things in Glosa, too: "An es u vide-pe."
[He is a see-er.] is pushing it a bit, when we would do better to say, "An
es u skope-pe." [He is a watcher.], and "An habe vide" [He is sighted.] or
"An habe un abili de vide." [He has the ability of seeing],
alternatively [He has the ability to see.].  On the other hand we use the
participle form as descriptions of things: "An es u ge-vide persona." and
"An es u ge-vide-pe." both mean either [He is seen.] or [He is the seen
person.] 

>ge- reverses the direction of the act,
*	You are right, but I stress that the reversal is ONLY in relation to the
participants in the sentence, and that the " ge-" specifically denotes that
the following substantive functions as a participle.	
	The action of the substantive 'verb' is still a positive one!
EG  Un andra bate u ju-an epi u buta.  
..  the man hits the boy on the bottom  

.. Epi u buta, u ju-an gene ge-bate ex un andra.
.. on the bottom the boy gets  hit  by the man

	The "ge-bate" is still a positive "hit", even in the passive: the boy
feels the arrival of the hand on his bottom, not the removal of it.
	But, in terms of the actor and recipient, we can say the " ge-" 
indicates a reversal: this is what passive voice is about.

>ge-vide means seen (adj), be seen (verb), the thing seen (noun), and? the
>act of being seen (noun)
*	Honestly, I believe we have a ^cart before the horse^ situation here.  IF
the Glosa construction " ge-" denotes the participle, then the normal
qualities of that 'part of speech' do apply: it acts as a noun modifier
that embodies some active principle, which , usually, has acted in the past.
	"Gene" is a 'form verb' giving us little information about the action
other than its 'direction' IE who does it to whom.  Sometimes "getting" an
object is all the action we need to know about, so, "gene", like "get", can
function as the only verb in a sentence, and would, thus, have the quality
of a substantive.
	"Ge-" is a sort of abbreviation for "gene" [get/got], but makes more sense
as a PARTICIPLE PARTICLE, akin to the "-ed/-en" moiety in English.
	Glosa, being a SV(O) language, needs a full verb in every sentence:
sometimes, as in English, it has only a 'form verb' to occupy the "V" slot;
these are "es", "gene", "habe" and "eqa".  The " ge-" particle does not
function as a 'form verb.'
So, I attemt to answer your question(s) about the meaning of GE-VIDE :-
#>ge-vide means seen (adj),# YES, participles are fundamentally adjectives.
#be seen (verb),# NO, not as an infinitive; but YES to "being seen" as an
adjectival group. 
#the thing seen (noun),# NO, not an elided noun phrase:  .. U GE-VIDE RA is
the full noun phrase; "ra" [thing] is a 'form noun'.
#and? the >act of being seen (noun)# NO, this is asking too much of
language, in general: in Glosa, the participle would need to be part of a
descriptive phrase EG  UN AKTI DE GENE GE-VIDE .

	N.B. If we take the abbreviation process too far, meaning is lost.
Because Glosa works without verb inflections or Part-of-Speech markers, it 
relies, for its semantics, on both syntax and description.  How else, in
English, which has few inflections and only some P-o-S markers, do we say
"the act of being seen" without using  the same number of words that we do
in Glosa: five? 

>so would I be correct in believing that "It is seen by the man." could be
>neatly translated by
>Id ge-vide ex un andra.
>
*	No: too neat.  What you have written translates into English as, "It seen
by the man." which is a non-sentence because it lacks a "V".
	Count the number of words in the compared English and Glosa sentences, and
you will find that there is one less in the Glosa sentence: there is one
word MISSING.  The missing word is the centre part of the SV(O)
prescription: the Glosa 'form verb' "es" [=] is usually reserved to
indicate equivalence; so the 'form verb' "gene" [gets] ^takes the crown^
that you would have "is" ^abdicate^.
	Certainly, in following the English syntax, Glosa has logical phrases and
clauses: " .., ge-vide ex un andra, " is a perfectly legitemate adjectival
phrase, as is its glos in English.
EG
"id, ge-vide ex un andra; qi pa komence voka, pluso skope an, e peti apo."
 it seen by the man flew who started to shout  also saw him   and flew away

>And I suppose,
>An habe pote ge-vide == An pote ge-vide => He can be seen
>
*	Well no.  The types of 'verbs' at work do need more clarification in
Glosa.  "Habe" is more directly involve with the direct act of HAVING, than
is the English equivalent, which get itself caught up in some pretty
complicated usages, which would have had to have had a very interesting
linguistic history.
	In trying to start with a fairly clean slate, we are starting off, in
Glosa, with as few complex linguistic structures as possible.
	"pote" is a member of the 'auxiliary verb' class - in its major function -
as a verb.  These auxiliary verbs precede a substantive verb, and are
(usually) not used alone: "pote", "posi", "sio", "debi", etc.
	Again, your Glosa sentence lacks an effective verb:
"An pote ge-vide." => He can seen.
	In English, "can" {pote} and "seen" {ge-vide} are both 'verbal 
elements', but there is still something missing from the 'verb phrase', and
that is the 'form verb' "be" {gene}.

	So, "An pote gene ge-vide."  =>  He can be seen.  The two sentences have
the same number of words, and both need an effective verb in them.  In
Glosa, we are not slavishly following English, but we are using the
syntactic structures of English ... purely for the reasons that English
syntax is logical, and it is as simplified as it can be, while still
retaining meaning.

    This whole discussion by Robin puzzles me mightily in the matter of

    Definitely.  Please see below.

    Why, pray tell, do we need this clumsy construction 'gene ge-X' at
all except to convey a nuance discussed below?  As Robin points out,
'ge-X' functions as a sort of pseudo-inflection or pseudo-agglutination,
the only one in the language.  It forms the rough equivalent of the past
participle, which in bare form in English is really a passive.

    And in English and various other languages, the full passive
construction consists of a passive participle and a copula.  The copula
merely links the "passiveness" of the participle to the subject.  In
short, the copula is all we really need:

        Id es ge-vide ex andra.
          It is seen by a/the man.  ('Un' is unnecessary here, because
          the preposition 'ex' must necessarily be followed by a
          substantive and therefore need not be explicitly marked.)

    The Glosa authors have made this clear:

        ge-lose feli
          lost cat
        Id frakti.
          It beaks/is breaking.
        Id pa frakti.
          It broke.
        ID PA GENE FRAKTI.  (sic! -- NOT ge-frakti!)
          It got broken.
        ID ES GE-FRAKTI.
          It is broken.

Hence, for non-idiomatic pseudo-passives, use 'es ge-X' in place of the
clumsy 'gene ge-X' unless one needs especially to express a nuance.
Even so, the form is NOT 'gene ge-X'.

    I think that here the authors have again allowed themselves to be
mislead by the notorious habits of their native English.  "Get" is one
of those portmanteau words that carries a multitude of meanings, which
they have allowed to sneak into Glosa with a slavish imitation, where
many languages might use separate words for the various meanings.

    Despite its many uses, several of the meanings of "get" can roughly
be summarized under the headings of "become" and "acquire" (although
this is not exhaustive), which many languages may not subsume in a
single word.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the authors have allowed
these meanings to collapse into 'gene' as a counterpart of "get."  Thus,
both "become" and "obtain/acquire" can be rendered by 'gene'.
(Although, to de sure, another rendering of "become" is 'esce'.)  I
think this is unwise and leads to confusion.

    One might say that if the window is broken, it acquires brokenness.
However, there is a subtle nuance of meaning here in English.  If the
window is broken, it is patient.  If it acquires brokenness, it is
agent.  The two situations are not precisely equivalent.  Nevertheless,
in most circustances I would say that most users of English employ a
passive construction to emphasize that the subject is patient rather
than agent.  Consequently, in Glosa we might SEEM to have:

        Id es ge-frakti.
          subject is patient
        Id gene ge-frakti.
          subject is agent

However, the authors have indicated the latter to be simply:

        Id pa gene frakti.  (Depending on the nuance, 'pa' might be
          unnecessary.)

"It gets break." will do for subject-as-agent and "It is broken." for
subject-as-patient.  In this case, I supprt the A&C usage.

    Remember, if we always try to smuggle English usage into Glosa. we
may be doing a disservice to all non-English-speaking potential users.
Why should English be the sole determinant of Glosa usage?  This is
another example of instances in which feedback from non-English-
speaking Glosa-pe would be invaluable.  Unfortunately, as we know, they
are not on the net.

Let me think out loud...

I will use the following notation: (preinterface)notion(postinterface).  Every word in
Glosa (as defined by the dictionary rather than by the ending) is either a notion or a
preposition.  A preposition (without a comma before it) overrides the postinterface of
the preceding notion.  Every notion has a default preinterface as defined by the
dictionary.  The default postinterface is (whole).  The preinterface for the first word
in a sentence is always (context).  The final postinterface in a sentence is always
ignored. A preposition (with a comma before it) ... that's more complex!

Vide and Ge-vide are two different words.  They have the same meaning, but different
interfaces.
(agent)vide(patient)            -> think of the notion of seeing
(patient)ge-vide(whole)      -> think of the notion of seeing


Id vide = Id es vide
-> (context)It(whole) (agent)seeing()
-> It sees (G'i vidas)

Id ge-vide = Id es ge-vide
-> (context)It(whole) (patient)seeing()
-> It is seen (G'i vidig'as)

Id gene ge-vide = Id es gene ge-vide
-> (context)It(whole) gets (patient)seeing()
-> Something starts to look at it, it acquires see-ed-ness (G'i ekvidig'as)

Vide id
-> (context eg: they default:something)Seeing(patient) (whole)it()
-> Something is looking at it / It is seen  (Vidig'as g'i)

PS
"Id habe ge-vide" would, I suppose, mean "It has something that is seen"

*	This question does not compute!  A Starter Dictionary" is one used by
someone to LEARN a language - get the right 'feel' for the vocabulary,
understand how words and phrases articulate, get the 'lilt' of the
language, and generally gain confidence in using it.  But the language they
learn to use still remains a 'baby language' at this level.
	Even when writing the Glosa version of the Three Bears, I had to go
outside the 1000 word list for a few of the words.  But, some people will
want to discus politics, others philosophy, and others, again, computers,
etc.  I feel strongly that Glosa needs to have a very clear-cut mechanism
for the development and interleaving of technical vocabularies.  
	But the vocablary that first delivers Glosa to learners (1.5 - 2K) needs
to be friendly and fairly comprehensive to allow light conversation on most
topics.  Paul, do you base your question on any historical precedent - of a
2K language that permits full discussion?

*	I suspect so.  While compiling a single list from the Glosa 1000 and the
Glosa 6000 lists in the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary, I was aware of
discrepancies, and did make decisions on these - just to get the job done
in a reasonable time.

usage for good (enough) etymological reasons.  Had I researched every word

some tricky finger-work, because among the three lists in this book (E->G

	Rather than add to a "baselined" 1000-word list, I would prefer to prune

this is very time-consuming work; Ron Clark was at it for at least a

essential.

these concepts comprise the true 'essential' dictionary.  Ron Clark
actually took the concept list from _Roget's Thesaurus; maybe Roget,
himself, saw something magical in the number "one thousand."

*	Thank you for this comment, Bill.  Yes the companion book(s) would be
worthwhile, and, for some, essential.  Whithin a cultural setting, however,
the more able would intuit the way to make the language work, and 
would explain it in the relevant natlang to others, who are less intuitive.
	I am not so concerned with purity, more with economy of resources and
human effort.  Such a "do it yourself" book would be printable in bulk and,
hopefully, on ASCII-based computer printers, and would be produced without
the G.E.O. group having to learn to translate into, or commission, versions
of Glosa instruction books in the world's myriad tongues.  Where the
expensive effort comes in is in the thinking of the educational ploys to
achieve all of these ends, IE making it work, on the page.

*	Yes, this could be sent with a book to a particular location .. possibly
even a page from a nearby language EG a Spanish Page to a Portuguese.  With
a first contact, we could find a person who knows a language that has been
covered with a 'prompt sheet,' and get them to do an equivalent one for
their culture.
	I am a great believer in the power of the human imagination.
Perhaps the problems are there only to give us something on which to
stretch our minds.
	Anyone attacking the World Language Problem, of course, has decided to
grapple with one of the most challenging of problems.  I do believe that
the best brains should be applied to this problem .. but, they've got us.

site.  But we don't have offices in different cities dotted around the
globe.  Yes, we should: please write with your plan to the authors.  They
will probably wish to see evidence of proven performance in 
using Glosa before authorising anyone to act on their behalf.
	I am "NSW Agent for Glosa" but do not advertise, nor put out a shingle to
this effect.  Perhaps I should, as you suggest, locate some advertisements
in the local media.  The trouble is that auxiliary languages, as a topic,
are a non-category: no-one wants to accept the concept as being within
their area of interest.  So, OK, this should simply be a provocation to me
to make it into a category.  I possibly have been lazy in not thinking of
this, lately.  When I first returned from the UK ~18 years ago, I did some
advertising and a couple of talks, but this led no-where.  Perhaps it is
time to start again.
	The question of groups is finding a ^shepherd.^  By this I suggest that
starting a group learning an unheard-of language asks a lot, and primarily
calls for an "authority" on the language to watch over the ^flock^ guiding
them through the tricky passes and observing them as they roam the plains.
Questions like "Did I get it right?" need to be answered almost
immediately, to ensure continued progress.  The idea of a correspondence
course with cassettes comes to mind for the reasonably affluent
non-networked group.  The non-affluent, non-networked need a lot more
material help, but, magically, are more self-reliant.  
	Certainly, we should have more satellite centres so that enquirers can be
serviced with the minimum postage cost.  also, if Glosa materials are
stored electronically, they can be printed using a computer printer, on
demand.
	Paul Bartlett points directly to the need for promotional materials in
various national languages.  Somehow these can be produced for electronic
reproduction, so that, for example, a German speaking enquirer can be sent
information through my printing the right file: the one with the  .GER
extension.
	Distribution of Glosa-pe is not circulated as an open list - I think it
should: Imust raise it with the authors that requests have been made for
names and addresses of people to write to.  Most are Post Office addresses,
involving paper, envelopes and postage stamps.

centralised up to now.  I have held stocks of G.E.O. materials in the past,
but stopped sending the ones proclaiming "Glosa has NO GRAMMAR" when I
found this counter-productive.  It would be nice to have stocks of Glosa
materials on hand (or on disk) ready to hand out (or run off).  This would
be especially so, if we could all feel happy that each dictionary with the
same name contained the same words spelt the same way.  Hence the value of
the present work in trying to standardise the vocabulary.

done so.  I was writing regularly to the Ugandans, but this is a slow
process, because they have to save up the money to buy stamps.  Maybe we
need to build up a pen-friend system so that people can vie with one
another for the record number of penfriends on their list.  Paul Bartlett
would say, "But is A using the same wordlist as B?" and this is a valid
question.  
	Basically the distribution of Glosa-pe is very dotty, with individuals
showing interest, in ones and twos, very widely separated .. except in
Uganda and at Oak Log Middle School in Atlanta.

*	Best if we can arrange a more or less democratic way of discussing such
possible changes .. on a concensus basis.
	They are scared of losing money and time on the Net, while they would
rather deal with the wider, non-networked group.  By the way, at present,
Ron is on Glosa full-time, but Wendy has to go out to work to support them.
	I know that Paul says it is wrong for the fate of a social invention to
hinge on the finances of the inventors, but, at present, Glosa depends on
the survival of the authors, who are running a fairly centralised,
non-distibuted organisation.  It would be great to have a map of the world

clearcut idea of what is the right syntax, but this is not stressed by the

	The thing that is deceptive is the ease of construction in English: we can
use sloppy syntax all our lives, when speaking English, and not know it.
But, while for Glosa, as in English, the same basic rules of syntax apply,
we will make badly formed Glosa sentences if we use the same sloppy syntax
that we probably would have gotten away with, in English.
N.B. Newcomers to this list might note that in Glosa phrases, the
substantive word, whether verb or noun, comes last: this is described
technically as a 'head final' structure.  Modifiers (adverbs, adjectives,
etc) precede the substantive word they modify.

*	I think that is the main thing: an IAL must be ready to serve its users
in any area of human activity, and, as such, the vocabulary should be
there, available, as needed.  The fact that the full terminology for brain
surgery is not in the standard dictionary, does not suggest that surgeons
should not be able to access a suitable lexicon to talk about such things.
	If people can cover most of their life interests within a 2K lexicon, they
must be living in an intellectual desert.  However, if they can get fluent
in a new language, within 2K, then the two thousand words have served their
purpose.  But, when they want to get into something really interesting,
like a heated discussion on language reform, or they wish to express
themselves interestingly, they will soon discover the limits of a 2K
vocabulary.

I would say that all languages provide their users with increasing levels
of complexity as interests and linguistic skills grow.
	It would be, I feel, honest to say to people that once they master their
first dictionary, or is it reach the limits of the dictionary they start
with, then they will move on to a larger dictionary with a larger vocabulary.
	Once our brain surgeon is happy with the normal vocabulary of this larger
dictionary, he will want to discover the medical extension to the language
so that he can effectively attend the next world conference of brain
surgeons in Alma Ata.

*	But doing it this way, we run into the over sufficiency syndrome that
Paul has reported.  People will feel that they can't possibly learn all of
the words in the dictionary, and, thus, will reject the language as being
too hard.  It might be a darn good IAL vocabulary, but learning of
language, like everything should be in gradual stages, and this suggests
the use of a restricted, but adequate, vocabulary, at the start.

	While a world speaking to itself using a 2K vocabulary will only be using
a 'baby language', the matter of cost explains the sending of 1000-word
lists to the majority of Glosa-pe.  If they had had the money to buy the
larger dictionary, they would have paid for one, but most Glosa-pe have
either been given a version of Glosa 1000, or have had only enough cash to

There's no way to point out the absurdity of a false claim without insulting
the person whose claim is being de-bunked.  The NGL folks say they want to
get "market share" for their new L1 language, and I simply pointed out that
there is no market clamoring for new L1 languages.

The NGL folks also claim that their language is nearly a loglan and "more
suited to the modern world than English," then one of them puts forward a
vocabulary list derived from Ogden's Basic English -- a list of some of
the most vague, polysemous words in English.  Whenever a bunch of 
anglophones design a new language for the world and then offer one-word
English glosses for their morphemes, it is a sign that little or no
attention has been paid to semantics.

The gap between the claims made by NGL fans and the reality is beginning
to rival that of Glosa.

    I will try to respond to a few points in some of Robin's posts here

    I think this would be a very good idea for those who really want
the language to succeed.  But I really don't know what would happen if
they decline to accept it.  Like John Schilke, I think it would be a
bad thing if there were a split in what little Glosa movement there is.

    Yes.  Pidgins.  They are in daily use and have a restricted
vocabulary (although I have no information on the specific vocabulary
size of particular pidgins).  As I have mentioned before, I have read
that Tok Pisin, a pidgin, is in use in parliamentary debates in Papua
New Guinea.  Is a pidgin a "baby language"?  It would seem to me that
the idea of a "baby language" is more a put-down than an argument. 
Sorry, Robin.  Was Hogben's Interglossa a "baby language" with its
restricted vocabulary?  And I never estimated the base vocabulary size
of Pham Xuan Thai's FRATER, but he translated the entire United Nations
Charter into it, as well as portions of relgious scriptures from around
the world.

    I think it comes down to differing ideas about the purpose of an
auxiliary language.  I do not see any one single auxlang as the be-all
and end-all of the totality of human communication, just a help for
those of dissimilar tongues.  That is why I am not in favor of such a
large vocabulary.  There may be room for more than one auxiliary
language, one, say, for basic communication and one for international
subtlety.  (But again, see FRATER; I suppose I really should try to
estimate its vocabulary.)  I see something like Glosa in the first role
and something like Interlingua or even Esperanto, with their
multi-thousand-word vocabularies, in the second.  (But even such a
division of labor might or might not really be necessary.)

    There is also the issue of competition in the auxlang marketplace. 
An isolating language with a small vocabulary might have a distinct
advantage over something like Interlingua, with a vocabulary running
into the tens of thousands.  It would to me.

    But it has happened!  Alice Morris Vanderbilt poured money into
IALA, which produced Interlingua.  I doubt that foundations might put 
a lot of miney into Glosa -- although you never know -- but an
enthusiastic rich donor might.

    I don't think so.  It appears to me that we just have differing

    "Lost face"?  I have to say that that one escapes me.  Being poor
myself at the moment (I can barely afford to stay on the 'net) I can
sympathize with the authors' possibly impecunious situation.  That is
hard.  But life itself is hard at times.  That is the unpleasant
reality of things.  They gave me approval to put the Glosa Basic
Reference on the world wide web without any specification for payment
by shareware or any other method.  Their copyright is on it, but the
cat is more or less out of the bag.  If it were merely smoothed out and
enhanced along the lines I have suggested in the last few weeks, I
would be satisifed.

    Yes.  I was using more a bottom-up approach, and you (and Bill
Patterson, as nearly as I can tell) are top-downers.  If the intention
of our efforts is in fact to come up with a revised/enhanced base
vocabulary, we _may_ be able to come out more or less in the same place.

    No doubt, and he is to be commended for his labor.  I am not
discounting it, and I cannot claim that I would necessarily do a better
job.  That is precisely why I have taken the bottom-up approach. 
Unfortunately, it is results that count, now how much sweat by whom 
was put into the effort.  Will he (and Wendy Ashby) let no one else
participate in the effort?  I don't know.  However, they did accept my

    I think you are overlooking the pidgins again.  A lot of folklore
has been preserved and recorded in Tok Pisin, and I have heard that
there are even radio broadcasts in it out of Australia itself.  It may
be similar with Police Motu and other pidgins.

    Which might well be my own case.  Over the years I have developed

    This has been, more or less, my position all along, and my hunch is
that the base might not have to be much larger than that in the current
Basic Reference.

Some search engines scour the web, sucking in every word on every page,
discarding only the common ones for the language of the page (according
to their estimation) such as "the" or "a" for English pages. These engines
*will* have your page, but they're so bloated with words that they return
many many useless hits with the few useful ones mixed in somewhere.

Some just examine the titles, so it's important to stuff the relevant words
in there too.

Some are more commercial and will guarantee that your site will be within
the first few hits - for a price. That could be argued either way, as a Bad
Thing or a Good Thing. But it could be useful.

Something I just started experimenting with is the HTML META tag. Some
engines index on this "keyword" information, so this could be an important
tool to use. For example, on my pages I've put something like this...

<HTML>
<HEAD>
  <TITLE>Ailanto: Glosa</TITLE>
  <META NAME="keywords" CONTENT="glosa, language, auxiliary, international, auxlang">
</HEAD>
etc...

...and then next week or so I'm going to try some searches on combinations
of these keywords to see what pops up.

I hadn't thought of this. Is this due to poverty or their sort of economy?
The thought saddens me, that such a thing could be an obstacle to an
intellectual, educational, international pursuit.

If you can get that information we might be able to give them a hand.

Hey, I like UNIX! I use it every day at work. HPUX 10.2, and up until
a few months ago we were using elm for mail. Of course, we've also had
W95 & NT machines around too; and now we're using an NT server and
Outlook to handle mail, and a new ISP.

Anyway, there's lots of good freeware out there.

    Of course, I was the one who forwarded the post (from a public

I just thought I would send it along as at least _some_ mention of
Glosa.

Subject: My Approach to Glosa
To: glosalist
Date: Sat, 13 Jun 98 21:1

    From time to time I have been known to express myself poorly. 
Perhaps of late I have done something like that with respect to Glosa. 
Let me say here that I would like to see Glosa or something like it
succeed as an auxiliary language.  When I first encountered Glosa, I
was fairly enthusiastic about it, and I did put in many hours of labor
developing the Glosa Basic Reference on the www, corresponding with
Richmond to obtain their approval.  It was only later that my
enthusiasm cooled somewhat as I encountered some of what I consider
insufficiencies in the language and its presentation.  But I think
these insufficiencies are remediable without anything like major
revisions, and it is to those matters that I have tried to address 
myself.

    I would still like to see something like it succeed, even if I
never master it myself.  So the remarks I have made of late have been
intended as constructive criticism, even if at times I may have
expressed myself infelicitously.  I think that there is an honest and
mutually sincere difference of opinion on the vocabulary size issue. 
That may have to be dealt with.  But all the rest, even if I have not
presented myself well, has been with the intention of helping, not
complaining.

	While these postulates may all be self-evident to superior intellects,
some of us on the Glosalist are just your average World Language Reformers,

*	I had thought of VIDE being a lexeme '=the notion of seeing', but then I
imagined the GE- particle to have a lexical value of its own, as well.
While most Glosa-pe would be more in tune with Subject and Object, rather
than (agent) and (patient), these more traditional terms, though less
flexible, would probably be adequate for most learners. 
	Somehow, I feel your second proposition (Subjective Voice) is not correct
for Glosa.  Though abstractions are theoretically satisfying, I would
appreciate some more concrete representations to help me understand what
you are saying.
   Without an example of what you mean, the  ''(patient)ge-vide(whole)''
statement is fairly meaningless to me.  Might a possible example be:
   Eng. "He is seen by the world."
   Gls. "An es ge-vide ex u munda."#
  ..... "An gene ge-vide ex u munda."%
  ..... "An ge-vide ex munda." * 
 #: O.K. but imports the English-like usage of the BEING concept.
 %: Old Glosa, but my preference owing to presence of "gene" as PV marker.
 *: Feels wrong to me; seems over abbreviated; lacks a full 'verb'.

	AND, before commenting on the examples given below, I would say that such
theoreticisation may not be helping the general move towards the
dissemination of Glosa.  My understanding of the best use of this List for
the development of the language is more in the use of dialogue.  You do
seem to be expostulating what you think Glosa is, or ought to be, rather
than than looking to see what it has become - over the past twenty years.
	There is certainly room for development ... and improvement ... in the
language, and this is necessary if the language to give the best showing
when, or if, an IAL competition is announced.  BUT, I am not convinced
that, at this moment, discussion at the top theoretical level is the best
use of the human resources available to this project.  

>Id vide = Id es vide 
>-> (context)It(whole) (agent)seeing()
>-> It sees (G'i vidas)
>
*	 These are not equivalent: syntax suggests "es" leads into a gerund =Eng.
"seeing".   A shaman who smokes the local weed, and perceives scenes by
looking at the inside wall of his tent, could tell you: it is seeing.]
	"It sees." is the right rendition; I'm not researching the Esperanto, but
assume that that language is your base reference for the ability of words
to convey meaning.

>Id ge-vide = Id es ge-vide
>-> (context)It(whole) (patient)seeing()
>-> It is seen (G'i vidig'as)
>
*	"Id ge-vide."* is not a full sentence: no full verb.  So =/=.
	You have interpreted the Gls. "ge-" to be equivalent to the
Esp. "-ig'-" as a Passive Voice marker: this is not so; Glosa's "ge-" makes
sense, syntactically, as a Participle Marker.

>Id gene ge-vide = Id es gene ge-vide
>-> (context)It(whole) gets (patient)seeing()
>-> Something starts to look at it, it acquires see-ed-ness (G'i ekvidig'as)
>
*	Again =/=.  "es" and "gene" have a supplementary relationship: it is one
or the other, not both.
	Glosa tends to 'map onto' English quite well, but the reverse process does
not seem to work.  It looks as if you have thought:-
  ~It  is  getting  seen.~
 .. | . | ... | ..... |
 .. V . V ... V ..... V
  "Id  es   gene   ge-vide."*

BUT this process is invalid.  English does not map onto Glosa, as it
appears you have attempted to do.
	Though it is not my desire to do so, I will consult the _Esperanto- 
English Dictionary_ by Butler, because I respect your use of that language
as a semantic baseline.  So, using the analytic mode, which is not my wont,
I get:
  G'i  ...... It
  ek-  ...... begins to
  vid- ...... to see | seeing  .... [I prefer the Infinitive to the Gerund]
  -ig'- ..... becomes | be | get(ting) <Intransitive, Passive>
  -as  ...... now <Present Tense>
I render this as  &It is beginning to be seen.& ____(1)
 ................ &It is now getting seen.& ________(2)
 ................ &It starts to be seen.& __________(3)
 ................ &It now becomes seen.& ___________(4)
 ................ &It is beginning to become seen.& (5)
 ................ &It is beginning to get seen.& ___(6)
	These are all acceptible English-language sentences, but are they all
legitimate representations of your Esperanto sentence, or of the Glosa
sentence with which we started?
Giving the same treatment to the Glosa version,
 "Id gene ge-vide." 
I get:
  Id  ...... It
  gene ..... gets <Passive Voice marker, when followed by "ge-">
  ge-  ..... (got) <="-ed" or "-en" as Participle Particle>
  vide. .... (to see) | seen <=Participle when Infinitive preceded by "ge-"

>Vide id
>-> (context eg: they default:something)Seeing(patient) (whole)it()
>-> Something is looking at it / It is seen  (Vidig'as g'i)
>
*	"Vide id." is simply the Imperative: the Subject "Vi", or "Tu", is 
implied.  It seems quite reasonable for a syntax-based language, like Glosa
to use the Infinitive form to make the Imperative.
The Esperanto (baseline) sentence says much the same, but with possibly
un-necessary inflection:-
  Vid  ... to see | see | seeing <Imperative, not necess. shown by syntax>
  -ig'- .. becomes | be | get(ting) <Intransitive, Passive>
  -as  ... now <Present Tense marker> 
  g'i  ... it

AND for comparison:-
  Vide ... to see | see | seeing <Imperative implied by syntax>
  id  .... it

>"Id habe ge-vide" would, I suppose, mean "It has something that is seen"
>
*	When considering such sentences - in the abstract - I do try very hard to
picture a realworld situation in which the utterance might be made.
	"I picture myself at Lightning Ridge, opal mining (though I've never been
there), and I see a possum scampering off into the bush.  Looking at its
paws, I catch the glint of light on the prize opal, that I have just dug
out, and give chase.  It has something that I have seen!"
	Though I wouldn't feel comfortable with the construction you have given -
probably because "habe" demands an Object - I might, in the heat of the
moment, come out with:-
  "Id habe u ge-vide ra." [It has the/a seen thing.]  But I try to avoid
such ^pretzelised^ constructions.
	HABE in Glosa conveys TO HAVE and TO HAVE THE PROPERTY OF.  There are
usages like this in French .. l'eau avait chaud.(possibly)

*	Does NGL stand for New Generation Language?  I take it that "loglan" is
used here generically, to mean "logical language."  I see the parallel here
with Glosa, however, the Glosa authors started with Roget rather than
Ogden, so the foundation is well-laid.

*	It is quite clear that Glosa uses a "word translation dictionary" rather
than a dictionary with definitions.  Glosa would still have been on the
drawing board had the authors decided to go in for a full-scale dictionary;
so, I, for one, am thankful that they took the pragmatic view, and cut a
number of corners.
	But it is also very clear that semantics is the submerged, larger portion
of the language ^iceberg^.  The authors took a direct approach to the
situation and dealt with the visible element of syntax, claiming that the
sense of language learner/user would allow them to sort out the meanings.
	As I now understand it, the syntactical analysis is the first, but
superficial, stage of linguistic analysis, while a second, more searching,
semantic analysis follows this.  However, because the understanding of
meaning is much more testing of our linguistic systems, most Linguists and
Communicators concentrate on the visible, rule-governed element of

*	I take it that this rather smart comment is from the David Armstrong
whose name appears at the head of the post.  He obviously thinks that
Glosa's claims and its realisation are widely separated: he is probably
still recovering from reading that Glosa has no grammar, and thus the
language can be learnt without the need for a grammar book.
	Such people, as Armstrong, may be time-wasters, but I will agree that our
promotional statements could be understated rather than overdone.  Perhaps
the authors should change their advertising agency to one with better
copy-writers.
	I find it quite interesting that there is such a range of theories extant
to describe language: if Linguistics was as good as it thinks it is, I
would have more respect for the comments of its practitioners.  But I can
see that the secrets of language are still locked in a 'black box' called
the brain, and I feel that the contents of this box are just as likely to
be intuited by the likes of Clark and Ashby, as by a Chomsky.

Sorry, David,

*	Do you see elision at work here?-  EG
An pa vesti-se in u ge-texo tegu. An pa vesti-se in u tegu; qi es ge-texo.
 .................. |______| .............................. |____________| 

U ge-texo tegu pa es ge-vesti ex an.  <Passive Voice>
the woven cover  was   worn   by him  
 ......^^.................^........

In u texo vesti; qi an pa tekto, un andra pa ki in u kamera. <Active Voice>
in a woven garment that he made  the man  entered  the room
      
COMMENTS: I would say that using "texo" as an 'adjective' [=substantive
functioning as an adjective] is tricky: it could be translated into English
as either the participle "woven" or the gerund "weaving"; using *rough
Glosa* we just throw it in, and #may the receiver beware#; but, if we are
being considerate of our listener (or just accurate) we use **precise
Glosa** and spell out the participle using the appropriate affix, "ge-".
  So, maybe already, there is *correct* (pedantic OR accurate) Glosa, and a 
*vernacular* (back-fence OR rough) usage of it.  Perhaps "gene" is a case
in point: I see it simply as a 'Passive Voice marker'; and, while others
might see the inclusion of "gene" as unnecessary or wrong, I prefer to
think of it as the correct form, thus peceiving its absence as yet another
case of elision.

GAMMA TESTING: This is a concept I find handy.  In the same way that Bill
Gates alpha and beta tests his software, then releases it - still
containing bugs - on an unsuspecting public, Glosa is now past the alpha
and beta testing stage, but may still contain *bugs*.  Windows 95, in its
third version is apparently bug-free after very extensive 'Gamma Testing'
of versions one and two on the buying public; Glosa is now in its Gamma
Testing stage, where it seems user ready, and does work quite well, but
might be tweaked into better shape.  
  Under experimental conditions, I prefer to use the 'as is' 1992 Version
of Glosa, although some of the 'bugs' (alternative spellings, different
terminal vowels, synonyms, etc) are known to us, here, and have been
discussed.  The "experimental conditions" I talk about is the use of Glosa
in the Third World: the Tri Munda 'experimental subjects' are NOT
discussing the linguistics of Glosa, they ARE using it as a language.  
  For reasons which make good sense to me, I am trying not to confuse the
two strands of Glosa R&D: while the Glosalist/Conlang strand of Glosa
discussion takes a 'disinterested' scholarly direction, the 'Field
Application' adopts a 'committed' practical one.  I hope that these two
strands of R&D can complement one another, even though they might appear,
at present, to be going in opposite directions.  
  Glosa is being Gamma Tested in Uganda; and, after the 'back-room boys'
tinker with it a bit, 'cleaned up versions' of the dictionaries are likely
to be sent to them as *upgrades* ... without any serious discussion being
necessary about any (minor) changes in the lists, when compared with
earlier ones.
  Tweakings to Glosa's grammar (syntax) might be another matter.  I will
soon start sending more guides on this to Uganda, but will discuss their
content with Glosalist subscribers and the authors before sending
pidgeon-post paper versions of these to Uganda.

*	Using basic P-o-S underlining, this Passive Voice form is:-
  Id   es  ge-vide  ex  andra.
 Pron - V - Part - Prep - N

	The forward-direction Active Voice version, in simple form, is:-
  Andra vide id.
   N -  V - Pron

 . In AV there is no 'form verb' just the substantive 'verb'.
 . I prefer "gene" as the 'form verb' in PV, because the %gets% concept
seems more apt than the %equivalence% concept that is (OR should be)
conveyed by "es".
 . "andra" is a 'noun' (= substantive functioning as a noun), and that is
what the syntax would lead us to expect, so the "un" would seem unwanted or 
elided.
 . What if the substantive after the preposition functioned as some other
part of speech? EG
  "Id es ge-vide ex kogita; ... "  <"ge-vide" used metaphorically>
   it is  seen  from thinking  
 
The "u", if included, 'flags' the coming of a simple Noun, of the Indirect
Object variety, and I personally feel happier with this style of
communication.  In the second example, "kogita" can be seen to function as
a noun, but the syntax (and semantics) tell us it is functioning as a
gerund, and that it ought to be followed by a Noun Clause.

*	It looks as if I have been using Old Glosa, again - with the 
"gene ge-X" structure: that was the way I learnt it; must get Richmond
feedback on the present usage for full Passive Voice.  I still like the
O.G. form.

*	I look at the Glosa lexicon from the concept point of view, and see that
there is a valuable conceptual difference between these two Glosa words;
so, when 'thinking in Glosa' I consider the abstractions conveyed by the
words, and try to use them accordingly.
  IE  esce - become, through growth
      gene - gets; gets to be

  EG  "U ju-bovi esce u fo mega an-bovi."
     ~The calf became (grew to be) a very large bull.~

      "An pato gene ma mali."
     ~His illness becomes (gets/got) worse.~

>    One might say that if the window is broken, it acquires brokenness.
>However, there is a subtle nuance of meaning here in English.  If the

*	So, in Glosa, by choosing the right 'form verb' "gene" or "es" we change
the flavour of the sentence, ... and thus of the way the 'participle'
relates to the subject of the Passive Voice sentence.

>    The two situations are not precisely equivalent.  Nevertheless,

>          subject is patient
>        Id gene ge-frakti.
>          subject is agent
>
*	Seems normal: the subject is the main participant in our sentence, and
comes first; but if the subject has the action done to it, we naturally
choose the PV form.

*	Now that you have spelled it out in full, I agree with what you have
said, BUT, and there is a big "but", this level of sophistication in
language use is just too much for learners, who are new to the language!!!
	For the sake of getting Glosa up and running, at a high level of fluency,
the fewer the rules, and the less nuances the better.  As long as the
language is not set into an inflexible structure, then these 'extensions'
of usage can be added later.
	For all of the reasons set out above, I favour the teaching of a
simplified, standardised form for the creation of the Passive Voice, which
was totally absent from Old Glosa - and, I suspect, from Hogben's Interglossa.

*	. English usages should not be incorporated uncritically.
	. These would impose an additional burdon on the non-English-speaking
learner of Glosa, agreed.
	. But where usages in English emerged as a result of the evolution of a
'natural' use of language, then there is every chance that comparable
usages will be equally 'natural' (IE psycholinguistically correct) in Glosa.

Date: Sat, 20 Jun 98 23:4

Glosalist Frinds and Glosa Authors,
   This is a brief statement of our differences over scope of the language
and optimum size(s) of dictionaries.
   Possibly the best situation for the world would be to have a number of
auxiliary language for different purpose, say Glosa for tourism, Esperanto
for diplomacy, and Interlingua for commerce; this would be similar to the
present situation with English&French for telephone exchanges, English for
air traffic, Aymara for the Andes, and Swahili for E.Afrca, etc.
   Glosa could be a trading/emergency language with the scope of a pidgin,
like Tok Pisin; or it could aspire to being a full language with universal
scope.
   Up to now, I have been working on the latter assumption:-
	1. I have the feeling that political leaders will want to have to make
only one decision, and will see dupication as an unnecessary and avoidable
expense.
	2. I have assumed, all along that Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby have projected
the Glosa concept into research and diplomacy, as well as offering a
langugewishing to provide people with a languag for daily living.
	3. If there were different auxiliaries for different areas of endeavour,
there would be junction areas that needed to communicate within communities
served by two or more auxiliaries.
	4. While Glosa is being disseminated a limited vocabulary is all that can
effectivly be supported by the G.E.O., and so the authors are concentrating
on the Glosa 1000 groups, even though they use the Glosa 6000 range in the
periodical, _Plu Glosa Nota_.
	5. While I look at sophisticated discussions in English, and wonder how
the ideas and nuances will be conveyed in an uninflected Glosa, I work on
the principle that the language is capable of extension through creation of
compounds, and through development of a more sophisticated affix system
than, at present, with the two letter categories.

	On the question of the optimal size of a Glosa dictionary for general
circulation, a happy compromise can be reached, I am sure:-
	a. While Paul Bartlett and Bill Patterson feel that a 2000 word dictionary
should be adequate for the present, I have argued for a speedy upgrade to
the fuller 6000 word dictionary.
	b. In the present situation, it would seem that a compromise at the 2K
mark would probably serve Glosa well for the next five, or possibly ten,
years.  Whole communities of Glosa-pe could gain fluency in the language
and comprise an effective global community - operating within the limits of
approximately two thousand words.
	c. use of a 2K dictionary would provide considerable economies in postage
and the learning load for those starting with the language.
	d. With the desire for more communication power, some Glosa-pe would feel
the need for a larger dictionary, such as the 6K edition; but, general
Glosa publications could be largely restricted to the widely distributed
vocabulary, giving meanings for words, beyond the 2K range, when they are
required for specific published articles.
	e. It is imaginable that a research publication, using a fuller lexicon,
could be circulated among those wishing to explore the direction
of future development of the language.  Such a publication could be the
site of publishing of scholarly works on the way Glosa might become
generalised and universalised, after an anticipated adoption as the IAL.

	On the question of dissemination of Glosa learning materials in electronic
format, I have raised the concept of Shareware:-
	i. Although software piracy exists, the release of Glosa dictionaries,
learning materials and publications as "Shareware" estblishes the copyright
owners' legitemate claim to the intellectual property and to the right to
profit from its distribution as Shareware.
	ii. Any distribution of Glosa materials through the Internet, as
Shareware, protects the G.E.O.'s ownership rights, while both fostering
increased future sales of paper-based publications, and bringing in a level
of revenue from Registrations.
	iii. In traditional marketing terminology a Shareware release is a "loss
leader", which involves the calculated risk that those sampling the
products will be attracted to make more substantial purchased,
subsequently.  In Shareware, ways can be arranged to prode sufficient to
whet the appetite for more.  
	iv. While the Glosa organisation desires both sales of materials and
dissemination of the Glosa ethos, Shareware offers an increase of both,
albeit with a time-lag between the distribution of the copyright materials
and the receipt of revenue.  However, taking the broader distribution
networks available to Shareware, such a situaion should soon provide a net
financial gain.
	v. Releasing Glosa learning materials as Shareware is good Poblic
Relations, because it offers people the opportunity to investigate the
language on a "try before you buy" basis.  This gives many people the
opportunity to learn about Glosa, and to try the language before they
become finacially committed; also, it gives the marginal enquirer, who will
subsequently become a Glosa speaker, the chance of discovering the language
effortlessly, without the feeling that he is risking anything or declaring
a commitment.
	vi. Seldom is a complete work released through Shareware channels: enough
materials for fluency in Glosa could be issued on disk and through the Net,
such that interested people would want a hardcopy dictionary and graded
lessons, which could be included in the Cost of Registration.

    There are, in fact, those who propose precisely this: more than one
auxiliary for more than one purpose.  I myself have mixed feelings about

    At the risk of sounding tiresomely repetitious, there simply is
no one "Glosa 1000" but rather multiple "Glosa 1000s."  It is this
inconsistency that dampened my initial enthusiasm and has disinclined
me to put a great deal more effort into it.  I would rather learn one
Glosa, not multiple Glosas.

: the principle that the language is capable of extension through creation of

    I have thought that the 17 (not 18!) current affixes might have been
extended originally, and some time ago on the Glosalist I proposed a few
more affixes.  However, I am not now suggesting adding too much to the
basic structure of the language.  My main "hobby horse," if you will, is
a consistent vocabulary (three issues here) and presentation (mainly in
the form of extending the "Mechanics of Glosa" approach).

:         On the question of the optimal size of a Glosa dictionary for general

:         a. While Paul Bartlett and Bill Patterson feel that a 2000 word dictionary
: should be adequate for the present, I have argued for a speedy upgrade to
: the fuller 6000 word dictionary.

    I think that this is a genuine and real difference of opinion among
the participants on Glosalist.  Considering the current size of the
Glosa Basic Reference on the world wide web, which was largely created
from collating different alleged "Glosa 1000s", my estimate of an
updated word list has been in the 1500 - 2000 range.  Robin and I
obviously differ here (Bill has to speak for himself), as I consider a
relatively small vocabulary to be one of the great strengths of an
auxiliary language like Glosa.

:         c. use of a 2K dictionary would provide considerable economies in postage
: and the learning load for those starting with the language.

    In practical terms, this is true, although it is not my primary
point.  However, a smaller dictionary could be much more efficiently
turned into other national languages, which is almost a necessity if
Glosa is to prosper.

:         On the question of dissemination of Glosa learning materials in electronic
: format, I have raised the concept of Shareware:-

    I cannot speak knowledgeably about other countries, but to the best
of my information, shareware is legally enforceable in theory in the
United States and Canada.  However, in practice the monetary amounts are
so small that the economics of enforcement for infringement are not
really worth it.  Shareware is truly an honor system.

:         i. Although software piracy exists, the release of Glosa dictionaries,
: learning materials and publications as "Shareware" estblishes the copyright
: owners' legitemate claim to the intellectual property and to the right to
: profit from its distribution as Shareware.

    Copyright is already claimed for the materials on the world wide
web.  I was very careful about putting a copyright notice on them
(although the "registered charity" business is meaningless in the US
so far as I know).

:         ii. Any distribution of Glosa materials through the Internet, as
: Shareware, protects the G.E.O.'s ownership rights, while both fostering
: increased future sales of paper-based publications, and bringing in a level
: of revenue from Registrations.

    The whole matter of copyright and intellectual property before the
law on the internet is a real can of worms.  There is a lot of
wrangling and disputation going on in the US, and undoubtedly elsewhere,
even as we speak.  Before it is all over, I suspect that the courts in
many countries are going to have a field day.  However, is the desire to
spread the use of Glosa as a meaningful auxiliary language, or is the
desire to get rich off of it?

    A possible problem is the material already on the world wide web.
It is copyrighted in the name of the Glosa Education Organization, so no
one can profit from it (legally and morally).  However, nothing has been
said about paying for it, and it might be rather difficult to try to
claim payment retroactively.  If the vocabulary and presentation issues
can be smoothed out, I think that the world wide web is one of the best
means available for furthering the spread of Glosa, although to be sure
there are many who do not have access to it.  (What is really needed,
once a uniform version is available, is material in multiple languages.
Proponents of other auxiliaries are burning up their keyboards getting
material on their favorite auxlangs into place.  The other night I even
saw something in Albanian!)

:         iii. In traditional marketing terminology a Shareware release is a "loss
: leader", which involves the calculated risk that those sampling the
: products will be attracted to make more substantial purchased,
: subsequently.  In Shareware, ways can be arranged to prode sufficient to
: whet the appetite for more.

    With computer software, this may be true at times, inasmuch as the
non-registered, publicly-available version is sometimes what is known as
"crippleware."  Nevertheless, a lot of shareware is the real thing and
the author has no more to offer.  It is just an honor system that people
will pay up.

Dear Friends, plu Glosa-pe,

	As I was looking for another book this morning, I came across my 
rather sadly deteriorating copy of L. Hogben's _Interglossa_.  It is the 
1943 Pelican (Penguin) paperback, of some 285 pages.  It really is a fine 
job of printing, considering the wartime restrictions which myust have 
applied, but the paper is acid-treated and is showing more signs of age 
than I do!
	My question is this:  I wish to keep it and to keep it legible.  
I plan to ask around a bit about restoration, but I have few contacts and 
fewer hopes that anything can be done.  Mere photocopying (however 
expensive that would be) would miss the nicely colored (mainly red) 
segments of the printed pages and thus not really be a satisfactory 
solution.  I have no way to get it scanned for the internet, but I do 
think that it is a valuable historical (and linguistic) document, and 
should be preserved.
	Does anyone have any ideas?  I'd be willing to lend it for any 
reasonable length of time for "processing," but want the effort to be 
worthwhile and (one would hope) not terribly expensive.
	I'm eager to hear from you.  I've no idea how many copies exist, 
but this is the only one I have ever seen.  My copy bears a Dec. '43 date 
of the original owner, and I bought it about 1973 in a used book shop.
	Plu kardia saluta ex

sense of multiple and not wholly consistent vocabulary lists, which has
been one of my major points all along.  It was the discovery of this

    I do not know what you mean by "form" verb as opposed to
"substantive" verb.  ("Substantive" usually refers to a noun, pronoun,
or noun clause.)

:  . I prefer "gene" as the 'form verb' in PV, because the %gets% concept

: conveyed by "es".

    But the whole problem is that "get" in English is HIGHLY ambiguous
and polysemous.  Why, oh why, should this mess be imported into a
language such as Glosa, which is supposed to facilitate communication,
not impede it with such a conglomeration as "get"?  I can easily suppose
that in many native languages, there simply is no single verb
corresponding to this hydra-headed monster of "get."  I think this "get"
in Glosa should be junked forthwith.

:  . What if the substantive after the preposition functioned as some other
: part of speech? EG

    What does this mean?  In every grammar that I have ever heard of, a
_substantive_ follows a preposition and is a substantive, not some other
part of speech.

:   "Id es ge-vide ex kogita; ... "  <"ge-vide" used metaphorically>
:    it is  seen  from thinking
:
: The "u", if included, 'flags' the coming of a simple Noun, of the Indirect
: Object variety, and I personally feel happier with this style of
: communication.

    Based on a direct communication I had from Richmond, you seem to
differ from them in usage here.  Although 'u' before a noun following a
preposition is allowable, I see not a particle's worth of difference in
the meaning whether the marker is there or not.

:                 In the second example, "kogita" can be seen to function as
: a noun, but the syntax (and semantics) tell us it is functioning as a
: gerund, and that it ought to be followed by a Noun Clause.

    By definition, a gerund is a substantive, albeit one derived from
a verb.  Some languages, such as IALA Interlingua, have no gerund
construction as such.  And why must a gerund be followed by a noun
clause?  It certainly does not have to in English.

: *       I look at the Glosa lexicon from the concept point of view,

    I have never understood just what a "concept language" is.  How does
such a thing, if it even exists, differ from any other language.  So
what is the "concept point of view"?

    I do not understand any practical difference.

    I do not have a copy of "Interlgossa" at hand, so I cannot say about
that.  However, I wonder what "Old Glosa" has to do with the price of
eggs now.  It seems to have been a provisional form which is no longer
"in effect" and therefore no longer particularly relevant.

    Exactly my point.  If someone has to learn or know English first in
order to use Glosa properly, then Glosa becomes entirely superfluous.
Just junk it and use English as the auxiliary language.  If Glosa cannot
stand on its own two feet, then it is worthless and a waste of time.

:         . But where usages in English emerged as a result of the evolution of a
: 'natural' use of language, then there is every chance that comparable
: usages will be equally 'natural' (IE psycholinguistically correct) in Glosa.

    "Evolution of 'natural' use of language" does not exist, in my
opinion.  Why are not usages in other languages equally "natural"?
Please consider the post I made on AUXLANG recently of an excerpt from
a work of fiction which addresses this very issue.  Is there a bit of
language chauvinism here?  My native tongue is "natual" and others are
"unnatural"?  Total rubbish.

    There are high-grade color photocopiers these days.  Just ask the
Secret Service trying to foil counterfeiters.  I used one once at a
copy shop in Salem (not far from where John lives).  The per-copy price
was higher, but the quality -- for a photograph, no less -- was not too
bad.  You might check around in the Kinko's and PIP type places for
color copiers.

    There is a copy, also deteriorating, in the Library of Congress in
Washington, DC.

    Powell's, maybe?  (I think they were already in business then.)

	I'll look into this, although I fear the 140+ copies (since the 
book would allow copying of 2 pages at once) might be staggering.

	Almost for sure!  I've frequented that haunt for many years, and 
have a vague recollection of finding it there -- much to my surprise.

	Again, thanks for the helpful ideas.

*   Do not give it to anyone for scanning: it would come back as single
sheets with the spine guillotined off, as did my copy of "Glosa 6000",
which is now held together with bulldog clips.
    You might contact a state library which has an Archive Section: such a
place should give you the best advice.  I too, have a copy in similar
condition to yours: I could contact the NSW public Library, which is active
in the preservation, through computer photographic scanning, of Australian
historical documents.

   Normal scanning with OCR is unsuitable for heavily formatted texts: the
photographic record is the only way to go.

Best wishes,
 Robin

*   I would rather, personally, stay with the "clumsy" construction, but
will see how it gets elided by other Glosa-pe.  As well as believing the
two parts to be functional, I will admit to a rare sentimentalisation, and
say that the 'gene ge-X' construction is ''quaint''.  It very clearly marks
the differentness of the Passive Voice form.

*   I refer specifically to the "Glosa 6000" dictionary, and I believe
there is only one edition of it: the 1992 First Printing.
    At an early stage, I decided that I would either have to completely
recast this dictionary, or use it, as well as I could, inconsistencies and
all.
    Using it 'as is' was both a calculated risk and an economic decision on
my part.  Had the drafts been properly edited and all inconsistencies
removed, prior to publishing, things would have been easier between us: as
it is, I am extending my suspension of judgment to the authors; and you are
pointing out that an invention must be well-crafted and polished, before
the man and woman in the street will bother to pick it up and look at it.
    I wished to avoid further negative reactions to the 'annoying typos' in
the dictionaries, so decided that it was time to rationalise the word-list
and SORT it using electronic means.  Thus, I had the "Glosa 6000" list
scanned, and that is where we are to-day: trying to rationalise the list to
something with fully consistent spelling, comprising a full working
dictionary - without marginal words.

*   I use "substantives" to cover all of the words that represent realworld
things, actions, or descriptions: Linguists have a term for this group,
which is infinite in size .. by contrast with this, there are the "function
words", that comprise a small, finite group of words that allow us to show
the relationships between the things, actions, and descriptions we are
talking about.
    In Glosa, where the lexical item can function as verb, noun, or
modifier, I find it convenient to label such a meaningful, multipurpose
concept/word as a "substantive."
    There are some words that are used in all languages simply to
facilitate the flow of ideas, and to define relationships beteen the more
^meaty^ words. 
Together with the 'function words' there are some 'verbs' that are present
for the demands of syntax more than to convey concepts: these 'verbs' are
often present to preserve the S-V-O form of the sentence, hence my term
"form verbs."  In English, words that can be used in this way are: is, do,
have, get, go. EG  I HAVE to have it.  He IS wet.  They DO want it.  I'll
GET GOing in a minute.  She was GOing to go.

But what makes English difficult .. and Glosa reasonably exact .. is that
'verbs', which are used as 'form verbs', also have a literal meaning as
well, and can, and should, be used SUBSTANTIALLY when this literal meaning
is called for.

substantially .. or, alternatively, on odd occasions, in one of its very
few, well-defined 'form verb' roles.

*   In these demo sentences dissociated from normal life, I still try to
imagine realworld situations in which they might be used.  So here I will
try to use the same 'clause' as a whole sentence, and as a subsidiary

  "Id gene ge-vide ex u diskursi."  - "It is seen from the discussion." .. (A)

  "Id gene ge-vide ex diskursi; plu faktu habe ero."  .................... (B)
  "It is seen from discussion, that the facts are wrong."

    In (A), the substantive after the preposition is a 'noun'.  In (B), the
same substantive is neither a 'verb' nor a 'noun', but has more of the
qualities of a gerund, and the "u" marker is not needed - though, if

*   In (A) and (B) above, I argue for the significance of "u" in
distinguishing between 'noun' and 'gerund'.  I suspect that there would be
something on it in the Functional Grammar method of analysing sentences.  Re
Richmond, I guess that the authors are promoting the elided, "telegraphic"
method of using the language.

auxlangs, and become fluent in them.  But since I am trying to do things in
my present lifetime, other than Language Reform, I have only budgetted time
to do R&D on, and learn, one auxlang.
    In the case of "kogita", above, I thought that the semantics called for
a *thing*.  Originally, a noun clause in Glosa could have the forms of
"xxx; X."
or "xxx; ke X."  (xxx -last word of preceding phrase; X - Noun Clause; "ke" -
=Eng. "that")  But, since then, the authors have decided to elide the "ke"
into oblivion: I may not agree that this is best Linguistically, but will
go along with it to support the ^party vote^.

*   The difference is a supposed difference between using language elements
as concrete objects, and using them as abstract ideas.  The difference
could be that between prose and poetry.  I fear that Glosa's rating as a
language in which the words represent abstract ideas (concepts) is one of
the reasons for its small currency.  Most languages do call a spade a
"spade", and one instantly has a mental picture of an object with which one
digs the soil. 
This is the opposite of the 'concept language' situation, in which "spade"
represents ~spadeness~, and the word, "spade" is interpreted from all its
possible realisations by reference to the surrounding words, IE its syntax.
    In the sentence, "He told me to spade the manure into the ground." we
see "spade" realised as a verb: we get a mental picture of the process of
turning a brown substance into the soil; we do not necessarily see - in our
mind's eye - a wooden and metal digging implement.  This is definitely a
case of using English as a 'concept language.'  BUT, most of the time that
people use English, they are using it as a 'concrete language.'  Glosa was
designed to be usable at the *abstract* level all the time: and this may be
a feat beyond the powers of most people.
    Of course, I believe that the move from concrete language (and concrete
thinking) to abstract language (and abstract thinking) is simply a case of
an improvement in civilisation ... and Glosa is riding on the crest of the
wave of this civilisation advance.

syntax and semantics.

*   What I should have said was that the authors originally said that Glosa
did not have a Passive Voice.  Then, somewhere between '84 and '92, they
decided that we would have to allow people the option of using a Passive
Voice form, if they really thought it was needed.  
INTERGLOSSA p180 features "(472) _ge_  that has got; that has been"
   EG  Hypo ge astra syn phylla urani
       Beneath a starred and leafy sky

  p181 has (473) "_gene_ get; acquire; receive; receipt or acquisition (in
the abstract)"
   "Gene is equivlent to become only when associated with an abstraction.
When become expresses incipient identification, we use the couplet proto
eque (469)."  and
   "Gene couplets convey the passive meaning of corresponding constructions
with acte, dicte and stimule.  When the amplifier is a physical state, we
can then express the passive by means of a habe couple; but it is better to
use the gene construction when an explicit agent follows, e.g.:
   U porta pre habe claustro   = The door was shut; The door has closed

   U porta pre gene claustro ex fe. = The door was shut by her.

There is a list of gene couplets on pp. 196-206 at the end of this chapter."
*   So, "ge" and "gene" are directly from Interglossa, but the Glosa
authors did not want to introduce Hogben's passive form into the revised
language; however, requests for a passive, caused them to look again at
Hogben's book.  Hogben went into considerable lengths to create phrasal
usages under the heading of "Semantics."  The Glosa authors have tried to
avoid printing a grammar book with the same *prescriptive* style that
Hogben used in _Interglossa_.
    Maybe, it is time to do something to redress this omission.  Perhaps,
through agreement with the authors, this group can knock into shape a brief
guide to the syntax of Glosa.

*   Well, I have had conclusive proof that this is NOT the case: LUI Hatao
from China wrote atrocious English, but perfect Glosa.
    But the absence of inputs from Glosa-pe living in non-English speaking
cultures is a serious deficiency of this List. 
    When we can locate Internet-connected, other-culture Glosa-pe, we will
necessarily have to use Glosa as the common language of this List ... or
possibly type everything in both our native tongues and Glosa.  The former
would be less time-consuming.

*   So all natlangs have over-riding cultural ingredients that adulterate
them in some way.  Glosa will, as you intimate all languages do, contain
some cultural adulterations that separate it from the hypothetical,
unobtainable 'natural' (psychologically pure) language.  How, I wonder,
would we recognise it, if we stumbled over a language whose grammar was
virtually ""culture-free""?

This, in my opinion, is Politically Correct rubbish.  However, henceforth
on this List, it is probably best for us (especially me) not to use the
word "natural", because a "natural language" cannot be defined.
    By your interpretation of the word, "natural", either we ought to avoid
using the word, or all languages are equally natural.  Either way, the
concept can have no discriminating power in our discussions, and so, is
rendered meaningless.
    Your AUXLANG story about the person who thought his language was the
only true way of thinking is clearly in mind.  It is probably a truism to
say that each person believes that thinking in his L1 is the only true and
correct way of thinking: it is simply a corollary of the Sapir-Wharf
Hypothesis.

*   I will cease forthwith to suggest, on this List, that one natlang, or
conlang, might possibly be more evolved than another natlang, or conlang,
but I will continue to think that through linguistic change, languages can
shed some of their earlier cultural encrustments, and so, move closer to
more neutral situations, communication-wise.
    Matters of "naturalness", linguistic evolution, and the thorny Lanuage-of-
Thought, might, however, be brought up - in private communications -
between myself and 'consenting persons.'
