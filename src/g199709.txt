Mi Plu Karo Amika,
        Sadly, I write this in English - for reasons of time.

        Paul Bartlett has reminded me that it is over a week since anything
happened on the Mail Forwarder.  Now, I will do my bit to change all this,
and must start sending interesting notes on, and in, Glosa ... on a regular,
hopefully daily, basis.  Also, Paul pointed out that what I thought was good
formatting of information often got mangled as it went through the system.
I will keep my formatting very simple, henceforth.

        The explanation for my quietness is that I have been using my ASCII
word-processor and DOS's SORT.EXE to change the  Glosa --> English  entries
in the "Glosa 6000" dictionary to  English --> Glosa  ones.

        I have already done a seventeen page double-sided, triple-columned
version of the "Glosa 6000"  Glosa--> English  list, and have printed and
sent one to John Schilke.  I am sending these, free, to Glosalist/Mail
Forwarder people; so, let me know if you don't have "Glosa 6000," and would
like this list.  The  English --> Glosa  list will take a bit longer: I am
only up to the E's, and have to go through ordering the synonyms, and
sometimes clarifying meanings.  With the list, there are some questions you
might help me to answer.

        I am trying to fit the English word plus its Glosa equivalents into
twenty-four spaces.  Also, if I have space to note the Greek origins of
words, I do: this is three spaces (,G.).  I have tried to keep each words
listing down to the single line, but this is not always possible, if there
are multiple synonyms listed.

        I am experimenting with the idea that some groups of Classical
alternatives are equivalent, while, within some of the Glosa collections of
words there is one, or possibly two, preferred ones.  For example:-

dust FARINA;KONIDIO,G.; 
 PULVE
[All are equivalent, or shown to be so.]

drop(a drop) GUTA
 & STAGMO,G.;STILA
[One is shown as preferred: the others are alternatives. Would it be best if
all multiple entries suggested one, such, preferred Glosa word?]

dry SIKA;ARIDI
 & AZALE,G.;KAPIRO,G.;
   TORIDI;XERO,G.
[Here I suggest that SIKA is the first preference, while ARIDI is the
synonym, and the other four are possibles, if necessary.]

        Should one first preference be given (first) for all multiple entries?

        I would like to hear your views on this - as learners of Glosa.
What would you like to find in an English --> Glosa dictionary/word list?  I
have found it necessary to give additional information in a number of
entries ... as in the case of "drop". This is not the action of "dropping
something, which would be LASE KADE, but a small sphere of liquid, hence
"drop(a drop)".

        After checking out alpha and beta versions on you and the Third
World Glosa-pe, I will negotiate with the authors to sell these print-outs
to the public ... needless to say with a "royalties" payment to the authors
for each one sold.

        I look forward to your feedback.
Saluta,
 Robin

Interesting, that Glosa should have so many synonyms. And also
interesting, that when many synonyms are available, the preferred
set may contain more than one. Sounds to me like there's some
historical explanation here, and enquiring minds want to know!

For any group of synonyms, I'd like to see one, the first, as
the preferred word. Synonyms are good, but to make sure that
everybody begins with the same base vocabulary, one word should
be chosen as *the* preferred word.

    Unfortunately, there is not 100% consistency in the Glosa
publications.  The terminal vowels of some words differ from
publication to publication.  This is unfortunate, because there 
are a few pairs of _different_ words which differ only by 
single terminal vowel, so this is a source of confusion.  As for the 
spelling checker, remember that you can have your own dictionary 
of words in addition to the supplied compiled dictionary.

Subject: Word Formation in Glosa
To: glosa
Date: Wed, 17 Sep 97 10:2

{Posted to the Glosa Discussion Group}
{Cc: to Glosa Education Organization}

    A few thoughts on vocabulary and word formation in Glosa.  I
apologize that this is not in Glosa itself, but it sort of illustrates
my point.

    As I mentioned in a response, there is some inconsistency in the
published documents.  Sometimes the same word has different terminal
vowels in different documents.  (Salta/salti was pointed out.)  This is
confusing, because there are other Glosa word pairs which differ only
by the terminal vowel but have different meanings.  (Such as
seta/seti.)

    It seems to be claimed that anything worth saying can be expressed
in Glosa 1000, but there is no consistent list of 1000 words.  When I
collated different lists from different "Glosa 1000"'s for the Web
pages, I came up with well over 1000 words.

    Having two Glosa words for the same thing, one from a Greek root
and one from a Latin root, is counterproductive.  If you learn Glosa
Word A for something and I learn Glosa Word B, we still cannot
communicate.  Having everybody learn both A and B is redundant and
superfluous in a language which is supposed to minimize the learning
burden.

    Vocabulary size is always a bugaboo in any planned auxiliary
language.  On the one hand, there is the wholesome desire to minimize
vocabulary in order to minimize the learning and usage burden.  On the
other hand, there can be difficulty for adequate expression with a
minimimal vocabulary.  One technique that has been used repeatedly in
auxiliary language proposals with relatively good results (my opinion)
is word formation from existing words by means of lexical affixes.

    Glosa does have seventeen "Generics" (-BO-PE is simply a compound
of two others) taken wholesale from Hogben's Interglossa.  This is a
good staring point, but I wonder if consideration should be given to
adding a few more.  (Notice that I said a "few," not a lot.) I have not
at this time worked out any suggestions, but I notice that the existing
seventeen generics all relate to concrete nouns.  Perhaps the
vocabulary could be extended somewhat without significantly adding to
the learning burden by a few judicious additions to the generics list
for concepts other than for concrete nouns (such as for expressing
abstractions or for extending or modifying the meanings of existing
words).  I do like the idea of the generics being two-letter
consonant-vowel forms.

    A few observations/thoughts.

{Cc: to Glosa Education Organization}

    In my post of earlier today, I should have added a couple of points.
The existing Generics in Glosa are derived from existing words and serve
as a kind of shorthand for them.  I think this is an excellent idea, as
it minimizes the learning burden and allows for more concise expression.
Also, there are the five prefixes:

        no-  reversal of meaning
        ne-  negation of meaning (not necessarily reversal)
        ge-  coming into being or being acted upon
        fe-  explicitly female
        an-  explicitly male

More excellent ideas/constructs in the existing language.

    A few ideas for additional generics do come into mind.  (These
are not hard and fast.)

        -ri  (abstRaktI)   abstraction
        -li  (abiLI)       able to be; possibility
        -ti  (akTI)        action or expression
        -le  (skLEro)      concrete expression (in general)
        -ce  (faCE)        causative; make, render
        -pa  (sePAra)      separation, dispersal
        -ga  (greGA)       aggregation, drawing together
        -ro  (mikRO)       diminution
        -gi  (GrandI)      augmentation
        -re  (itera, RE-)  repetition

    Again, I want to emphasize that I am not trying to expand things
all out of proportion.  The language should be adequately expressive
but still as reasonably concise as possible.  A scheme something like
this would have five prefixes and twenty-seven generic suffixes, which
I think would be brushing an upper limit, but it might allow for word
formation without having to expand the base vocabulary a great deal and
without having to use a lot of periphrasis to express basic notions.

re- is already listed as a prefix, so this suggestion is redundant.

As I mentioned to Robin, I like synonyms but I think that there
should always be just one *preferred* word, and that's the one to

metoo! metoo! E Qestio: Does anybody know the reasoning behind
these choices of Generics? Some seem obvious to me, some less so,
and I particularly like "-li", the Stone Generic; I've been
collecting stones for as long as I can remember, and am fascinated
by standing stones and such, and in fact my oldest boy is sitting
nearby playing with some stones right now.

In general, the Generics seem to have a nice homey feel and I'm
certain that the story behind these choices would be of interest.

But if a Stone Generic, why not a Wood Generic? Besides the fact
that we might suffer a "-li" collision, since "ligni" also begins
with those same two letters. Was stone considered to be more
important than wood? Was this a sign of the times or an insight

    The Generics are presicely the same as in Hogben's original
Interglossa.  I do not have a copy of that book, and the only 
copy I have ever perused I found a little hard to read because of 
the style.  (It was in a library from which I could not check it

Saluta Bill,
        I concur: one synonym is more than enough.  I suspect that the Glosa
authors were being generous with the languages, and included a number of
Classical roots with similar meanings, rather than being ruthless, and
restricting usage.  If one English word had two approxiamte equivalents, one
Greek and the other Latin, that should be enough: and, for the sake of
learners, the dictionary should show one word (Greek or Latin; it doesn't
matter which, just so long as one is chosen as the better word for the job)
as the preferred first choice!
        I am sending my Eng --> Glosa scanned list to the authors asking for
elucidation on this.  Mainly, I want to break up synonym clusters into
meaningful usable chunks (of one, or two, Classical roots each).  Up to now
they have not wished me to release the scanned version of their Glosa to
English "Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Net.  I am loathe to go against this,
but can see that if I sought help from members of the Glosalist moity, then
we would benefit from your advice and combined language knowlege on this.

What does the group think?  Should I ask the authors to release the Net
publication of the scanned "Glosa 6000" to restricted use by the Glosalist
group, for research purposes only, and not for general publication?  Or
should I select only the troublesome synonym clusters and ask for your help
to tease them out, straight away?  This might result in my printing a number
of synonym groups, asking you to help me break them down to more finely
defined entries,
so that the pattern could be like:-

englishword GLOSA1;
 GLOSA2;GLOSA3;GLOSA4;
 GLOSA5
  
  changes to

englishword GLOSA1 & GLOSA2
englishword(modifier1) GLOSA3
englishword(modifier2) GLOSA4 & GLOSA5

[NB I am aiming at a line-length of only 24 - 26, because I want to compile
the dictionary with three columns per page, giving pagewidths of 72 - 78
spaces.]

In this restricted space, how is it best to indicate the synonym: I have
suggested the convention " & SYNONYM".  Also, the ".G." tag telling us that
the Classical root is Greek, not Latin, is handy, but I did clip it when
this interferred with my linelength.  What does the group think about the
value of thes Greek markers?

On the matter of pagewidth, I have had trouble alraeady with linelength that
wrap-around, and also with tricky formatting that gets mangled as it goes
through the Internet.
        Now my Eudora right hand margin has been pulled in about five
spaces, and I have sworn to avoid all but the simplest of formattings.  The
3-column
dictionary would not get through the Net unaltered unless it was only 72
spaces wide, and all of the empty spaces were filled in with full stops.  At
this stage, I plan it as an ASCII, hard-copy printed production.  After all,
my main target population is the non-plugged-in masses of the Third World.

Saluta,
 Robin

    Bluntly put, they should have been ruthless here.  If you learn A
and I learn B, we still cannot communicate.  Why should both of us have
to learn two words when one will do?  An auxiliary language,
particularly one which seeks to function with a restricted vocabulary,
should deliberately avoid this sort of complication.

Oh yes! I'll confess my selfish motive immediately: I have a low
tolerance for Looking Things Up In A Dictionary. I guess I've
been using computers for too long - it's so much easier to search
a textfile - make the computer do the lookup. After I've learned
more of the language a hardcopy dictionary will be ideal, but for
now, in the beginning, the files that I've obtained from the
websites are a *great* help. Later, when I know Most of the words
instead of Few of the words - that's when hardcopy really becomes
valuable for me. Then I can take more time and thumb through the
dictionary in a more leisurely fashion, finding not only the
unknown word but also learning several others along the way.

And it would help Glosa by helping us...

> Or should I select only the troublesome synonym clusters and
> ask for your help to tease them out...

...for example, in analyzing these synonym clusters we might
want to search for similar words, or related words, or antonyms
and such - it's hard to predict where the research might take us.
Today I needed a couple of direction words. I really liked orienta
and austra, and that's what I used. But I also took note of the
synonyms (est and sud) which are shorter, and would be handy if
you were to be using them often - and wondered about the other
directions. grep... grep... (if you're not familiar with unix,
that's a file search) Hmmm. Nord/boreo and uest/ocide. Once again
I liked the longer forms but the shorter words are, well, shorter,
and more familiar-looking to me. Then I thought... directions. Like
on a map. We might want to abbreviate them. Boreo, Orienta, Austra,
Ocide. BOAO. Too (two!) many Os. Nord, Est, Sud, Uest. NESU.
Uniqueness!

(This also reminded me of Adventure games. I bet it would be much
easier to teach a computer to understand Glosa than most other
languages. Glosa software, anybody?)

So for brevity and abbreviation, I'd say that we should pick Nord,
Est, Sud and Uest as the preferred words and the longer words
as the synonyms.

Ouch. Just had another thought. That's good for written Glosa,
but what about spoken Glosa? I bet Est and Uest sound pretty
similar over a radio or telephone. For some special applications
we might want to reverse the preferences. Maybe the long words
should be the preferred words, with the short ones for special
written uses like maps and streetsigns...

So many things to think about.

> What does the group think about the value of these Greek markers?

Certainly of interest for etymological study, but unnecessary for
everyday dictionary use, so I'd say forget about them if they're
causing any trouble. They can be kept elsewhere where there's
more space.

Send it as an attachment and Eudora shouldn't mess with it at all.
It's only when you send it in the body of the message that Eudora
does its own formatting.

Seems like a pretty good first try, to me.  One hint that I think will come
up more in Glosa is an application of some of the ideas in Functional Grammar.
These may not have been worked out fully yet - for English - but I think
that the more regularised Glosa will operate using a limited set of the
Functional Grammar rules.

*       O.K. Bill,
Got your message, and the later one about the benefit to Glosa of releasing 
the "Glosa 6000" scanned version to Glosalist Subscribers.

On the technical (Internet) side,I would like to ask about your line-length:
does the word "line-length" appear on the right hand or left hand side of
your screen.  E-mail from you through the forwarder seemed to have short
line-length, and I wondered if normal-length lines wrapped around you screen.

On seeing the redirected offer from me, above, I deduce that all of the
normal line-length stuff over the Net gets 'wrapped around' your screen.
But the fault might be at my end .. though I don't think so.

If I place the three-column dictionary on the Net, it will take you and Paul
Bartlett a month just to re-adjust the formatting; I have already pulled in
the RHS margin in my Eudora 'Message Writer' half an inch as a result of "wrap-
around" complaints from Paul.  It looks as if I will have to pull it in a
total of two inches to avoid Wrap-around for you.  Which is best: using
Bartlett-
acceptable lines, or shortening them to the Will.Patt standard?

So, If I print and send hard-copy of the G-E dictionary, I should also
include a disk carrying this three-column, printable file .. as well as
single column,
readily computer readable versions of both the G-E and E-G creations.  I
have only I Mb of RAM, so the lists will be in bits that you can join up if
the whole dictionary will fit into your RAM. In DOS, I simply use COPY A+B C
to produce file C from the two other files.  Are you in DOS or Macintosh?  I
will include a copy of the programs GALAXY.EXE and L6.COM that allowed me,
together with the 
DOS SORT.EXE, to laboriously swap sides, sort, and format the dictionary.
Sadly, I didn't try sort until after I had compiled the three-column G-E
version.  This will have to be redone before I go commercial - offering
hard-copy versions for sale to the public.  Oh yes, Galaxy is a DOS ASCII
word processer: its poweful Macro function allowed me to queue in strings of
keystrokes that made creation of the dictionaries possible.

P.S. I decided to think, and, although the above message was written with
the wider lines, I have just pulled in the RHS margin in the middle of
writing, and the whole thing reformatted to fit the narrower page.  It
should all fit your system without wrap-around!!  Should I do this for all
messages sent to the Forwarder?

'U' and the 'L' in together.  Possibly, in Glosa, using "un" in front of a
word starting with a consonant gives it more `force.'  ~Un lupus pa skope

        I, too, find the longer forms more attractive, mainly for reasons of
poetry and mystique, but the shorter forms are definitely more suitable for
pedestrian use.  In rushing through the "Glosa 6000" listings I hadn't the
time for this level of cogitation: I should check back and change this in
line with the  North BOREO;NORD  pattern.

go down well on Conlang or with some computer professionals.  The objection
was that one shouldn't change the language to try to make it fit the
computer: eventually, people said, computers would be so smart that they
would do all the sorting out.  But Glosa has not been over-logicicised like
Loglan/Lojban .. it has just been simplified to an almost absurd level.  
        I see it as a Ph.D. task waiting to be snapped up: fitting Glosa -
or a sub-set of it - to computers to work as a Query Language.

    As for the issue of putting Glosa 6000 into machine-readable form
(I have a paper copy), that is largely a copyright issue with GEO in
Richmond.  However, I think there is another issue involved.  One of
the claimed strengths of Glosa is size of vocabulary.  Collation of the
various versions of "Glosa 1000" has turned up noticeably more than
1000 words, as I have mentioned before.  At the same time, I think it
unwise to expand the base vocabulary all out of proportion.  That is
why I think a small handful of additional non-concrete-noun affixes
would serve well.  In my opinion there is such a thing as too small: 
I doubt that a language with a vocabulary so small that it would all 
fit on one sheet of paper in medium type would be adequate.  At the 
same time, a base vocabulary too large could be a hindrance.  It would 
not be a "simplification" in Robin's words.

It appeared on the right hand side. But as you see above, it
gets wrapped in my reply. Usually I reformat quoted text in a
reply (as long as it doesn't change meaning) to make it look
better. This time I did not, on purpose, so that you could see
what happens when I reply.

When I send messages that are likely to get quoted I make my
lines shorter on purpose so that a few levels of quoting can
occur before things start wrapping around. I try to keep the
original text around 60-some characters or so in width so that
a few ">"s in front won't shove any text to the next line.

No - no fault anywhere! I'm just using shorter lines.
Your messages are coming through just fine.

Don't worry about me - no problem! And be sure to let me know if
there's anything I can help you with. Like the reformatting you
speak of below.

I've used Eudora before and like it a lot. Right now I'm using
Microsoft Mail simply because that's what my new ISP gave me.
For Net distribution, you really should try using attachments.
When I was using Eudora I think it could only do one attachment
at a time, but it may be able to do more now. Anyway, if you
send the file as an attachment it will get here *exactly* as
it is on your disk, no reformatting or wrapping at all. Try
it! Send me a chunk, full width, and let's see!

> I have only I Mb of RAM, so the lists will be in bits that you

I'm using DOS with a lot of UNIX-like utilities, and VIM for
most of my editing. I'd love to see GALAXY and L6 - I'm a
sucker for textprocessing tools.

Don't worry, Robin, really! It all looks fine to me!

        ISO SINE SONI vs ISO NO-SONI  I decided, on listening to the 'sound

        A. active voice; B. passive voice.

Subject: Setimana, Compounds & Synonyms
To: William
Date: Fri, 26 Sep 97 19:5


Today I discovered something important about "setimana" (week) which
I probably should have noticed before. I think that the significance
escaped me because the Glosa word has those same s-m-n sounds as
Esperanto "semajno" and Ido "semano", so I just thought of it as a
discrete unit. And perhaps those words have the same parentage but
it was never so clear to me.

Anyway, it occurred to me that "setimana" begins with "seti" (seven)
and there are seven days in a week. Could "mana" have meaning of its
own? Sure enough, "mana" is "morning" - "seven mornings" - I like
that! Plus, we get three words for the price of two.

Now, based upon this, I suspect the existence of a collection of
words, actually compounds but so common and useful that they appear
in the dictionary as standalone words in their own right. And this
suggests another criterion to be used in our selection of the primary
word in any group of synonyms. Glosa "seven" is either "seti" or
"septi" and "morning" is either "mana" or "matina". For some twisted
reason I seem to prefer "septi" and "matina", probably resonance with
other languages I've studied, but I'd argue that the preferred words
should be "seti" and "mana" for consistency with "setimana".

Of course, we could choose "septi" and "matina" and coin a new,
preferred word for week, "septimatina" - the important point being
that we retain consistency among the involved words, including other
compound words that might use one or the other of the smaller words.

Conflicts will undoubtedly arise, but I think it would be beneficial
if we considered these compound words when choosing our preferences.

- Saluta! - Bill
