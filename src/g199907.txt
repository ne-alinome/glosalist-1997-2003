Ave!

Mi pa gene posta ex Robin nu-di. Gratia de tu grama!

I received mail from Robin today, and thank God for that, because I had
forgotten about my Glosa interest since my first and only letter. The
reason will partially answer Robin's question about what are my
interests in interlanguage.

In the first place, my interest comes, of course, from international
communications and understanding, and I think I have no need to explain
further this.

I started, as it usually happens, with Esperanto, because it has had "a
lot" of "publicity", but mainly because I knew of the existence of a
free (mi ne habe valuta :( ) course of ten lessons through  e-mail.
I started the course during this Easter. But as soon as I got to the
third lesson, I thought: "I'm doing well with it, but this language has
TOO many things I don't like. I think it would be quite better if
it...", and I proposed to myself (informally) some solutions to the
limitations I saw in Esperanto. I remembered I had a book of
linguistics readers for anthropology students, that has an article on
Planned Auxiliary Languages. Despite of this title, in the article the
writer (a quite clumsy one) actually just "defends" (lamely) Esperanto
from the "attacks" of an Idist who "dared to say that Ido was better",
and cited the "supposed" improvements of Ido over Esperanto. It was very
funny for me to realize that the Idist improvements were quite exactly
the ones I thought Esperanto needed. So I joined inmediately an Idist
mailing list and contacted them to get some more information.

But both Esperanto and Ido are pretty much the same: the
"archaic" and "modern" forms of a completely European language. And that
I can not accept as International, Neutral, nor Auxiliary.

That same day in early may, since I couldn't get more information
out of my books, I went to the net. Researched through it, and with
godspeed found Glosa... (I'll get back with you later).

After some very harsh collisions with weird Esperantists that even
spammed me with threats and insults, and I never knew why... I finished
the Esperanto course the firt week of May, and started to throughly use
the language. I devoted 15 hours a day for it... until last week.

The first day of June, I created a mailing list, with the main goal of
getting Venezuelan Esperantists together through the net, since the
Venezuela Esperanto-Asocio doesn't atract any people to its see (and
you'll know why later in this letter... it's a creepy tale), but I
didn't announce it until June the 19th (not even two weeks ago!).
The first days of May I
contacted the Association, and asked for permission to build them a
website, although I knew nothing about HTML. I myself, alone, started
the construction, staying late up transcribing Venezuelans magazines and
literary works in Esperanto for the web page... I even got terrible head
and back aches (I still have 'em!) because of no sleeping nor resting.
Three days after announcing the creation of the group, at least 25
Esperantists from all the world had joined the list. The website was
launched. I was very happy, I had already forgotten the weird actions of
the weird esperantists.

An important member of the Universal Esperanto Association "awarded" me
with a membership to that organization because of my "seminal" work.

A nice Bielorussian Esperantist guy who was also an Idist I knew from
the Idist list, joined the Venezuelan Group.

I was very pleased, I said. "Althought almost all Idists are or were
Esperantists first, very few of today Esperantists have heard about Ido,
because past Esperantists said it was a heresy and declared them
enemies. Dear friend, your presence in our list pleases me very much. It
gives us a wonderful opportunity to tell Esperantists about Ido, and
show them that it is its ally. Despite the fact that Esperanto and Ido
are European languages, limiting their universality, I think Ido has a
lot of advantages over Esperanto, that could be praised."

Well, damn me for saying that, because the officialist Esperanto
position is the same as in the past, and they proved to be hypocrytes.
You could say I was shot with machine guns and bombed with shrapnel! I
was a "heresiarch", a "schismatic", and "enemy". "We declare war upon
you! Esperanto is the only international language for the world!".

I explained that I was not promoting Ido, but mentioning it. And I also
explained again that those two languages where in all aspects Europeans,
and pretending to make it the international language was a very
eurocentrical, ethnocentrical, racist goal.

Things got much worse. Much much worse. The discussion heated, the
attacks grew. I insisted in being a defender of the non-European
language speaking Underdogs. I demanded true neutrality and that the UEA
must recognize and permit the study and research of other
interlanguages.

Well, I condemned myself to hell, then. If you hear that Esperanto and
UEA respect and back Human Rights, let me tell you that by my experience
that seems to be a lie, since the war against me was declared by the
Vicepresident of the Venezuelan Association and the UEA's commissionate
for International Affairs.

I have gone into "exile". I use the "", because I'm actually still
there, under a pseudonym I created for defending me during the weird
events of the course. So effective I have been, that I have regained
quickly control over the group again, under the appearance of my alter
ego (I kind of feel like Zorro!). My alter ego was made by "its"
request manager of the group, since the Venezuelan Esperantist Leaders
are a bunch of very bitter and very old males that don't know how to use
the internet resources properly, and needed help from such well
respected "samideano" (my alter ego! Ha ha!). It seems that I have
succeeded at least on making them go silent, since I made them noticed
that the membership to the list was decaying, I've have defended very
well my ideas! Now even my original self seems to be respected, and as
the "other" I'm working on my triumphant return! God, it feels good to
be the good guy!

Such a strange world! I have never felt hate, but the pain was so big,
that I found five grey hairs growing in my 22-years old head this morning.

So that was what was keeping me away from Glosa. If I hadn't received
Robin's letter, I'd have forgotten Glosa, at least until next week.
Thanks, Robin!

Now, what are my hopes for Glosa?

Well, there are so many hopes! This is a language that really DOES
pleases me!

(And believe me, I have researched a lot about another interlanguages,
like Interlingua, Occidental, Novial, Loglan/Lobjan, Lingua Franca Nova,
Vorlin, etc. I even studied Volapuk today! And it's not as ridiculous as
Esperantists want it to be!)

I think that Glosa's grammar makes it (much, much, very much) easier
than any of those languages I mentioned. Not having inflexion makes it
great, and very international. All human groups, I think, can handle
this type of language, while inflectible and the other(s) are hard even
for those who speak it natively. I think I'll never get my own Spanish
right, but I have great hopes about Glosa!

The phonetic is pleasing, very pleasing (Oh, I finally got rid of that
horrible sounding Esperanto, so harsh, so difficult to Caribbeans like
me... so unpleasant... so full of stressed "i"s... it sounded like
losing on Jeopardy!).

I like the use of nu, pa, etc. for tenses, and I believe it deserves
religious praise!

The use of -lo, -pe, -ru, etc., kind of reminds me of African languages,
and are much better and more recognizable that things like the European
suffixes.

Oh, so many things I like!

Let me offer myself for Glosa! As soon as I learn it right, let me
spread the word about it in Spanish! I'm at your orders for translating
any information from English. I can't offer quickness, but you will get
hard work!

Robin, gratia de tu ofero! But I don't want to be abusive with you.
Remember that I live in Venezuela. Isn't mail expensive? (Or are we
Venezuelans too cheap?) I will only accept it if you guarantee it is not
a bother for you. So, here is my address:

Daniel Alegrett
Av. Sucre, Res. Yutaje, Torre D, Apto D-284. Los Dos Caminos, Caracas
1071, Venezuela.

Remember, only if it doesn't bother you! Gratia de tu kura e de tu auxi.

Although my main concern in Anthropology is Biological Anthropology
(still archaically being called "Physical" by a lot of National
Schools), in that field my main interest is the effect of Culture in the
Biological Nature of Man. "Man didn't create Culture. Culture created
Man". So, I guess it would enormously interesting to see the biological
effect of the use of a international auxiliary language that will make
brothers real brothers at last!

Mi fu habe poli amiki, kausa Glosa.

Gratia de vi tem.

A vi sinceri,

Daniel.

Saluta all..

I got on this list a while ago. I've been side tracked by my own language
project which isn't going as planned, and I've learned a bit of INterlingua
in the process, but reading Daniel's letter, has given me the interest in
making a possible go at Glosa.

So, what can we do here to get this list stinking active!!!

P.S.
I do know HTML, and if Glosa would like an official website, I can help
there as well!!

Maybe we could do some audio stuff??

One thing I played with was trying to sort the vocabulary into
semantic fields, to a greater degree than on Paul's page:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/glosaref.html

I used HTML form listboxes to collect all the animals, plants, etc.
But it is quite a task. The goal would be an easy Glosa-text-generator.
The first IAL to devise a good Java interface to generate and parse,
will win. That is sort-of the goal of the UNL project, which has
financing and a 10-year plan. Sounds really important ...

There is also a project by James Chandler on the AUXLANG list
to migrate Ido/Novial in the direction of a pidgin/creole,
effectively Glosa. I made a web page of a combined vocabulary:

Thanks for your support, and let's thank ourselves for waking up our
interest for Glosa.

I much fear that my internet access will be somewhat limited to e-mail
until october, unless I wake up at 3 AM and use it until 6 AM,
in order to have free access from my own. This is because I've moved
from Chemistry School (where I had free access to the internet) to
Anthropology School (where there's no access to the net) and the
university made me "quit" to my old Faculty and "suspended" me.
(They make all things sound so ugly) I'll not be a student of my
university until september, and I will have my very own access to the
internet the next month, when the Engineering Faculty (provider of
internet access for those faculties that don't have one) comes back from
its vacations.

Oh, in explaining such burocratic fiascos, I forgot to explain why this
situation bothers me. It's because maybe I won't be able to read or
study any Glosa text or information in the net for a while. Just because
that. But that's terrible.

Of course, I won't suffer if we "get this stinking list working",
according Michael's beautiful words, and start writing about Glosa
and/or in Glosa here.

After 15 minutes checking the Basic Reference text in the net, here is
my first attempt at using Glosa, in a translation from a ramdomly picked
text in an anthology of Spanish vanguardist writers (1925-1935). So, let
me know if I'm using the language right. Also, the basic reference text
doesn't tell much about using the indirect object. I have not studied
yet a tale that Robin included in the first letter sent to me. I think
it was Goldilocks. Nor I have studied the Shakespeare text in the net.
So, for this I got help only from the Basic Reference text.

"Mu pa taci; e Teo pa dice:
Mi ne pa veni homo Teo ad u Geo, sed homo u homini. E mi volu es;
seqe-co; vive ko plu homini kon alelo. Ka-co qi fu pa gene mi favo; qi
nu monstra maxi homini. Tu pa monstra homo homini; po tu ofero mi frigi
bibe-citri. Ka-co tu nu gene mi favo. Tu du es homini; tu ne tenti ki ad
ana; ne tenti ki a su tu. Co ne es ki ad ana; sed co es ki ad
'kata'..."

A re-vide,

Daniel.

    I quote the relationship between English and Glosa thus: one can
translate a Glosa sentence almost word for word into English, but the
reverse is not true.

    Tem mi grafo uti plu bi lingua, mi prima grafo u Glosa, po-co, mi

    When I write using both languages, I first write Glosa, then I translate

Ave!

Robin, what news of the 2.5K Dictionary and the Grammar that you've been
working on for Glosa? How about some more translation exercise posts? I was
enjoying tackling them.

I've been planning to do a semantic field ordering of the vocabulary too -
but have been waiting for the new words. How far have others got with this?

I made a HTML page with pull-down menus for each field,
acting as a rough 1-click dictionary. But it isn't easy
to categorize most words. Animals, plants, tools, OK.
Basic verbs and qualities, um, OK. Most words are
cultural fuzzy things, like "foreign" or "free",
which are not so easy. I didn't finish it ...

    It was only through actually writing in glosa that I started getting
the feel for the language.  Mathematically, I would say PRACTICE >
SCHOLARSHIP when it comes to gaining a feel for, and fluency in, Glosa.

    It is unfortunate that the virus struck my computer with the Grammar
completed, and work done on adding "omissions' and compiling tha 2500-word
NetGlosa list.  I will try to find copies of this work in my disks, but if
anyone can resend copies of these to me, directly, as they circulated on
the List, I would appreciate it.  My next three-week holiday starts at the
end of this week, and I will make a priority of bringing these sundry
projects to completion.  Thank you.

    But, as John says, "write as much [Glosa] as you are able."

Saluta,
  Robin

*   This enthusiasm is very warming.  I will suggest that at the start, you
might translate some of the promotional information on Glosa from English
to Spanish, thank you.  This can be copied directly from the Author's
leaflets, or might be modified and updated, to suit South American culture
and linguistic needs.  I should include some copies of Richmond leaflets
with the posting of the Dictionary Disk.

*   Sounds fair!  There has been an idea around .. for some time .. in
Linguistics,  called the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis, in which it is suggested
that the Language a person speaks shapes their thinking process.  Although
it is widely believed that this could be true, it is generally agreed that
no suitable experiment can be set up to test the hypothesis.  Even though the
Alegrett Hypothesis may be a special case of S-W, it might be possible to
experimentally test a hypothesis, which states that an auxiliary language
that aids clarity of thought, does, in fact, increase 'pro humanity'
attitudes among its users.

   The "Culture" <---> "Mankind" puzzle takes some thinking, but I think
you are right: a clearly defined set of 'rules for living' is needed before
a group of  Homo sapiens  makes it to 'Mankind' status.

   I think you have a solid hypothesis to work on, here.  And, there is a
reasonable chance that, in using Glosa as the language vehicle, we can
conduct experiment(s) which show that use of such a language actually does
produce a significant difference!

   Just what can we do to get the Glosalist moving!?

   a. One thing is to widen the subscribership: but numbers of people,
alone, do not make an active List.
     (i)  Daniel Alegrett can render the Glosa info into Spanish, and if he
creates a Website that is basically in Spanish - but which also has links
to English-language sites - we broaden the user-base.
     (ii) With Glosa info in Spanish and English, people who are not
natlang bilingual, will be instead 'auxlingual' and will thus be able to
demonstrate communication across the national language 'barrier.'
     (iii) There is a Glosa 1000 printed dictionary in Spanish: the authors
will allow us to use this.
     (iv) Subsequently, we might be able to mesh-in Webpages prepared by
Glosa-pe from other linguo-cultural groups.

   b. My stress with Glosa exercises on the Glosalist will be increasingly
in the direction of spoken and auditary fluency.
      (v) The need for a number of Glosa cassettes now becomes pressing.
      (vi) Comprehension written exercises are needed, as well as short
sentences for translation.
      (vii) Glosa-pe will be encouraged to attempt more creaive writing.

   c. Exercises from a wide range of human experience are needed.
      (viii) Different subscribers can send in their own exercises, and
these can be from a range of situations, such as:
    . Questions
    . Science
    . Emotive language
    . Logical argument
    . Reportage
    . "Vernacular" - polte conversation
    . Cultural exchange of information
      (ix) To make the List more fun - as well as translation from English
to Glosa, and vice-versa - we can mix the exercises up a bit, such as:
      > Identifying deliberate erros.
      > Questions .. write answers.
      > Answers .. write suitable questions.
      (x) Ggroup writing of stories and items to make up a Primer.
      (xi) Telling jokes in Glosa?
      (xii) Pooling ideas for disseminating and teaching Glosa.
      (xiii) ....... etc.

      I would like to see Glosalist jumping with ideas and subscribers'
Glosa scripts.

Saluta,
  Robin

>Hello Again,
>   Here's the second half of the Ver.2 Glosa Grammar.   R.G.
>  ---------------------------------------------------------------------
>
>5. Noun Phrases
>   J. Substantive as 'noun'
>      A simple sentence has two Noun Phrases, one for Subject the other for
>      Object.  The final word in a NP is a substantive acting as a noun.
>    i. A single 'noun' can constitute a Noun Phrase.
>   ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of determinants and modifiers,
>       as well as the final substantive 'noun' in a Noun Phrase.
>   K. Pronouns
>      These take the place of substantives, and represent them, acting in
>      every way like the full 'noun'.
>    i. Personal Pronouns represent people:
>      a)First person: mi [I], na [we]
>      b)Second Person: tu [you(singular)], vi [you(plural)]
>      c)Third Person: an [he], fe [she], pe [a person], mu [them]
>   ii. Impersonal Pronouns: u-ci [this], u-la [that]
>  iii. Relative Pronoun (Adjectival Clause Marker): qi [which,that]
>   L. Determinants and Numerators
>      These are particles that tell about the quantitative nature of the
>      'noun', and are placed at the start of the Noun Phrase.
>    i. Noun Markers: u [=a,the], plu [=the](indicates plurality); these
>       can be omitted, if context, or other words in the NP, clearly
>       indicate the presence of the 'noun'
>   ii. Countables
>       Countables exist in discrete numbers, and may be described using:
>      a)Numbers: mo [one], bi [two], deka [ten], bi-tri [twenty-three].
>      b)General terms: oligo [few], poly [many], mega, [big], pusi [small].
>       plura [several],
>  iii. Quantifiers
>       Substances that are Measured, not Counted, are described using:
>       u mero de [a piece of], ma [more], meio [less], maxi [most],
>       u qantita de [an amount of].
>   M. Noun Modifiers
>      Substantives functioning as nouns may be modifies qualitatively by
>      other substantives placed directly before them.
>     i. Adjectives: This is the traditional term for Noun Modifiers.
>    ii. Compounding: When two, or more, substantives combine, often
>        hyphenated, to form one complex concept, they modify the meaning of
>        one another.
>         EG trans-natio-korporati [TNC]
>
>6. Verb Phrases
>      A simple sentence has one Verb Phrase in the middle of the sentence:
>      the final word in a V.P. is a substantive acting as a verb.
>    i. A single 'verb' can constitute a Verb Phrase.
>   ii. Alternatively, there may be a number of particles and modifiers,
>       as well as the final substantive 'verb', in a Verb Phrase.
>   N. Substantive as 'verb'
>      In a V.P. one substantive functions as the verb.
>     i. The 'verb' represents the action associated with the substantive.
>    ii. The substantive is not modified to show that it acts as a verb.
>   iii. 'verbs' in Glosa are not inflected.
>    iv. The substantive 'verb' is the final word in the V.P. being
>        preceded in the phrase by particles and modifiers.
>   O. Auxiliary Verbs
>      These substantive - capable of acting as verbs on their own - precede
>      the main 'verb' and augment its meaning.  These are: es [being,is],
>      habe [has_the_quality_of,"is"], gene [gets,becomes,"is"].
>   P. Modal Verbs
>      These are lesser 'verbs' that usually precede the main 'verb'
>      modifying how it acts.  These are: posi [possibly], pote [can],
>      debi [ought to], nece [must], probabili [probably].
>   Q. Phrasal Verbs
>      A Phrasal Verb comprises a substantive 'verb' followed by one (or
>      more) "post-positions" that extend the meaning of the 'verb'.
>       EG,  ki ana  [go up], moti ab  [move away from], loka antero [put
>          in front of]
>   R. Verb Modifiers
>      The 'verb'is the final word in the V.P., and any word before the
>      substantive 'verb' modifies that 'verb'. The modifiers in a V.P.
>      follow a sequence of increasing importance to the meaning of the
>      phrase:-
>         Tense - Aspect - Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
>     i. Tense Particles
>        Strictly speaking there are two Tense particles:-
>         pa - Past Tense
>         -    Present Tense
>         fu - Future Tense
>         The default for a 'verb' not marked for tense is Present Tense.
>    ii. Aspect Particles
>        A number of other words relating to the timing or intention of the
>        action can come after the Tense particle to extend the expresion of
>        the 'verb':-
>          nu - immediate present
>          sio - would .. if  (conditional)
>          du - continues  (continuous)
>          fin - completed  (perfective)
>   iii. Modifiers(Adverbs)
>        These are substantives that describe the action,
>          EG forti [strongly], celero [quickly], sine sono [silently].
>    iv. Verb as Noun (Gerund)
>        A Substantive may represent the action, but be in the position of
>        a noun: here the Substantive has the qualities of both verb and
>        noun, and is called a Gerund; a Noun Marker (u/plu) is used to
>clarify
>        the syntax, if necessary, EG
>         An hedo kurso. [He likes running/to run.],
>         Fe kanto es fo boni. [Her singing is very good.]
>         U ju-an interese es u vola de plu modela aeroplana.
>          [The boy's interest is flying model aeroplanes.]
>      v. Verb as Adjective (Participle)
>         When a Verb is used to modify a Noun, the prefix ~ge-~ is placed
>in
>         front of the Verb to indicate that the action is received by the
>         second word, IE ge-X Y  ... where X and Y are substantives,
>          EG  u ge-klude tira  [the closed door].
>     vi. Subject and Object reversed (Passive voice)
>         To form Passive Voice in Glosa, the Main Verb is converted into a
>         participle, and is preceded by an Auxiliary Verb; the "actor"
>         follows the Verb Phrase as an "Indirect Subject", IE
>         "recipient"(Obj.)-Auxiliary-Participle-Preposition-"actor"(Subj.)
>          EG  andra           es      ge-morda      ex        kani
>           ... Un andra es ge-morda ex u kani.
>          The Auxiliary Verb can be ~es~ [is] or ~gene~ [gets].
>
>7. Syntax
>     The definition of syntax used for Glosa is "word order".
>   S. Precedence
>      Words in phrases are sequential, and there is an order of precedence
>      of words in phrases, of phrases in a clause, and clauses in a
>      sentence.
>     i. Precedence Rule
>        This states that, within a phrase, a word is modified by the word
>        immediately preceding it.  The modifying effect is cumulative
>        throughout the phrase, with the meaning of the final substantive
>        being qualified addatively by all of the words preceding it in the
>        phrase.
>    ii. Sequence in Phrases
>       a)Noun Phrases
>         Noun - Determinant - Numerator - Quantifier - Modifier(s) - 'noun'
>         Marker
>          EG. u   plura       tri-loba       mega      alti, rubi    flori
>       b)Verb Phrases
>         Tense - Aspect  -  Modal - Auxiliary - Modifier(s) - Substantive
>         Part.   Part.(s)    Verb      Verb                      Verb
>         EG. pa   sio        posi       es         forti         hedo
>   T. Sentence Order (SVO)
>      Glosa follows the majority sequence, of subject-verb-object, in the
>      structuring of its sentences.  As with English, on which Glosa
>      sentence structure is modelled, there are variations on this theme:-
>    i. SV: subject-verb (intransitive 'verb'), EG  An kurso.
>   ii. SVd: subject-verb-dependent_phrase, EG  Fe dice fo celero.
>  iii. SVO: subject-verb-object (transitive 'verb'), EG U kani morda an.
>   iv. SViO: subject-verb-indirect_object, EG Fe ki ad u boteka.
>    v. OVS: object-is_verbed_by-subject EG U kani es ge-bate ex un andra.
>   U. Compounds
>      Although words in Glosa do not change through usage, to generate new
>      concepts, two, or more, substantives may be grouped to form a
>      compound word, and such compounds are usually joined with a hyphen.
>    i. Normal compounds are formed from two or more full substantives, EG
>       kryso-buklas [golden curls,"Goldilocks"], moli-centra
>[soft-centered].
>   ii. Regularly compounded words are abbreviated to two-letter forms,
>       called "Generic Terms", that are affixed with hyphens to the preced-
>       ing substantive word, EG -do (domi)[house], kani-do [dog-house];
>       -bo (boteka)[shop], pani-bo [bread shop,baker's].
>   V. Concept Clusters
>      Some very complex things and actions require, for their description,
>      the adjacent placement of three, or more, substantive words; however,
>      this "clustering of concepts" is to be avoided, where possible, in
>      Glosa.  EG  u televideo cyklo undu genera-me
>                 [a television cyclic wave generator]  ... would be better
>      described as ... u genera-me de cyklo undu pro televideo
>                      [a generator of cyclic waves for television].
>
>8. Punctuation
>    Represents, in written form, the normal pauses and inflections of
>    speech; and, as required (to avoid ambiguity) indicates the beginning
>    of a new syntactic group.
>   W. Comma
>       a)Pauses within phrase
>       b)Separating equvalent syntactic elments in a phrase
>       c)Pauses between phrases
>       d)Separating clauses joined with a conjunction
>       e)Introducing a new phrase, where this avoids ambiguity
>       f)As parenthesis for brief additional information within a phrase
>   X. Semi-colon
>       a)Separating equivalent clauses in a sentence
>       b)Pauses between clauses
>       c)Introducing a new clause, where this avoids ambiguity
>   Y. Other
>     i. Colon
>       a)Introducing a list comprising equivalent clauses
>       b)Following a clause to indicate a consequence
>    ii. Exclamation Mark
>        At the end of a sentence to add emphasis or indicates surprise.
>   iii. Question Mark
>        At the end of a sentence indicating the asking of a question.
>    iv. Quotation Marks
>       a)Double quotes (") around
>          . Direct Speech
>          . Quotations from text
>          . specialised terminology
>          . book titles (Alternative use on Internet: underlining _Xxx_)
>                        (Alternative use in printed texts: Italics)
>       b)Single quotes (') around
>          . Direct Speech quoted within other Direct Speech
>          . literary reference
>          . special use of terminology for emphasis
>     v. em dash ( - ) pauses for additional information
>          . around additional information inserted as a clause
>          . as a single dash for additional information at the end of the
>             sentence
>    vi. Brackets (xxxx xx) around
>          . alternative wording
>          . special explanation
>          . additional information not part of the syntax of the sentence
>   vii. Idiom and metaphor
>        For clarity of expression across cultural boundaries these should
>        be avoided in Auxiliary Language usage; however, where it is
>        necessary - for literary purposes - to quote a national-language
>        idiom within Glosa, then such non-literal language ought to be
>        marked with some 'neutral' symbol, EG pluvi ^plu feli e kani^.
>
>9. Pronunciation
>    This follows the generalised pattern of European usage.
>   Z. Phonetic Rule
>      Each letter has one associated pronunciation.
>      N.B. This is not automatically reversible, EG ~q~ sounds like /kw/.
>   &. Vowels
>      The five vowels of Glosa have Italian (or Spanish) pronunciation:
>      a - AH, e - AY, i - EE, o - OR, u - OO.
>  &&. Consonants
>      These follow the general pronunciation within Europe, but, where
>      consonants have alternative pronunciations, the "hard"
>      pronunciation is used (g, h, j, s, z).  c is pronounced CH; y as ~i~;
>      x as /ks/; w is not used; and there is no letter carrying the
>      "soft" g, or "soft" j, sound.

Hi,
I am sending this email to everyone in my email address book as I thought it

If you work for a company who is not aware of this, it could help!
Apologies to anyone who already knew/was not interested.
Maybe if you send this to as many people as you know, we can avoid quite a
few computer crashes!

Subject: Small problem and fix for a Y2K glitch

  After running a quick little test, much to my surprise, I learned
that both of my computers would have failed on 01-01-2000 due to a
computer clock glitch. Fortunately, a quick fix is provided:

  Double click on "My Computer".

  Double click on "Control Panel".

  Double click on "Regional Settings" icon.

  Click on the "Date" tab at the top of the page.

  Where it says, "Short Date Sample", look and see if it shows a "two
digit" year. Of course it does. That's the default setting for Windows
95, Windows 98 and NT. This date RIGHT HERE is the date that feeds
application software and WILL NOT rollover in the year 2000. It will
roll over to 00.

  Click on the button across from "Short Date Style" and select the
option that shows, mm/dd/yyyy. (Be sure your selection has four Y's
showing, not two) Then click on "Apply" and then click on "OK" at the
bottom. Easy enough to fix. However, every single installation of
Windows worldwide is defaulted to fail Y2K rollover.

  How many people know about it? How many people know to change that?
What will be the effect? Who knows. But this is another example of the
pervasiveness and systemic nature of the problem.

  As far as MAC users, you will have to contact the dealers to see if
there is a similar problem and fix.

IGLOS - The International Glossary

This "International Glossary" is a project in construction. It is offered as
is and with the hope that any users might volunteer corrections to its
entries. Yes, there may quite a few needed corrections and this is where
making the file available may benefit all using it through constant
revisions and updates. The latest revision is dated 1999.07.26 - This
revision includes added English / Interlingua terms and meanings, plus
incorporates simple translations into French, German, Italian, Portuguese
and Spanish.

The file is almost 700k in zipped up form. When uncompressed it is over 2
megabytes.

Any help or suggestions are gladly received.

Sincerely,
Jay Bowks
