Karo Glosalista:

I am new to the list and I am not a linguist, but I have been enjoying
getting into Glosa and reading the Glosalist postings and e-mails to me.
But I have some questions and a couple of suggestions.

1) The other evening I passed by a bakery. The wind was blowing towards me and 
the bread smelled wonderful. Now, how to express this in Glosa?

Last night I passed by a bakery.
Pa-di noktu (Is there a word/phrase for "last night"?)
mi pa ki proxi ("I went near" = "passed by"?)

u pani popina (What is a "cook-shop"? It's in the EGB.)

The wind was blowing towards me and the bread smelled wonderful.
Pneumo pa du fla ad mi e pani pa se olface miranda.

2) I noticed in William Patterson's list of missing Glosa words, the word
"neighbor".  A kludge for this appears in a list of Glosa examples:
para-fe but neither I nor William feel this to be the best possibility.
William has listed a few words for neighborhood in Glosa: vicina and parokia.
Vicina-pe, or vicina-an, or vicina-fe would seem to work well for neighbor.
Parokia-pe doesn't roll off the tongue easily. What do other members of the
list
think?

3) Another word that is missing is "boring". Not that Glosa is boring! In fact
I've
picked up Glosa to help me get through some absolutely-brain numbing meetings.
Is
"tedio" the closest Glosa equivalent?

4) Pra = "had" but is there a past tense equivalent for "has"? 

5) Can time words go anywhere in a Glosa sentence, as they can in English?
*Now* I want to eat. I *now* want to eat. I want *now* to eat. I want to eat
*now*.

6) Am I right in thinking there is little distinction between adjectives and
adverbs
in Glosa? Position in the sentence determines the function?

7) Finally, I have to come down in favor of using the verb gene or es with the
prefix
ge-. I do not feel ge- by itself is enough. It seems to me that ge- indicates a 
state of being. The object has been put into the state of whatever - being
broken,
being seen, being cooked, whatever. The object *is* (es), or *becomes* (gene)
the state.
Maybe even *is made* the state - se face. Pa and fu change the time but not the
state of being.

Saluta,
  Debs

    If you say 'pa-di', then it is not necessary to say 'pa ki',
because 'pa-di' already puts the time reference in the past.  I keep
harping on this in the list because if native-English Glosa-pe get into
this habit of over-marking everything under the sun, they may run into
trouble understanding Glosa-pe of other native languages which do not
do this over-marking, so that the other Glosa-pe do not do it in Glosa. 
(Actually, I would think that 'pa-noktu' would suffice in place of
'pa-di noktu'.)

     I would make "cook-shop" as 'kuko-do' and "bakery" as
'pani-kuko-do'.

> 2) I noticed in William Patterson's list of missing Glosa words, the word

    I think that 'para-pe' would serve well for "neighbor."  So do the
Glosa authors.

> 3) Another word that is missing is "boring".

    Perhaps something could be worked up from the verb 'fatiga'
("tire").

> 4) Pra = "had" but is there a past tense equivalent for "has"? 

    'Pra' seems to be an obsolete construction retained only by Robin
Gaskell, at least in my acquaintance.  Glosa's verb constructions do
not necessarily mimic those of English exactly, just as Esperanto has
no simple set of perfect tenses.  We need not -- indeed, should not --
think that the English way is the only way, and certainly not the only
correct way, of doing things.  In fact, compared to those of some
languages, English verb constructions are rather "muddy," mixing up
tense, mood, and aspect.  Many adult learners of English have a
difficult time with English verbs.  We should avoid introducing this
confusion into Glosa.

> 5) Can time words go anywhere in a Glosa sentence, as they can in English?

    So far as I know, yes, so long as the meaning is clear.

    That seems to be the case.  Both are modifiers of one usage or
another.

    I have already tendered my opinion on this in the past.

I tend to push this idea farther than the creators probably had in mind.
My wish is that any word can act as any part of speech (though some
combinations are less sensible than others!). But it does seem necessary
to have *something* mark the end of the subject and the beginning of the
verb.

I'm still thinking about this one. Sometimes it feels wrong, and sometimes

I disagree. I think that this is one of those situations in which
agglutination fails, because the root-word combination just isn't
specific enough. Of course, in any language that builds words as
combinations of smaller roots, you'll run into what I like to call
the "purple-berry" problem....

(The "purple-berry" problem: I recall one language, or maybe just a
hypothetical example, which referred to some small fruit, *not* a
grape, as a "purple-berry"; a grape was a "wine-berry". Wine-berry
would be recognizable by a member of a culture that does wine, but
not by a person who doesn't know wine; either way, a purple-berry
could easily be taken for grape, or some other purple berry.)

Sometimes that's not a big problem, because once you learn that a
purple-berry is (or is not) a grape, you'll be okay. And there
aren't too many ways to interpret "purple" "berry". But "para-pe"
(or "para-fe", etc.) just doesn't work for me. There are too many
possible interpretations of "beside-person", and no particular reason
to nail it down as "neighbor".

We have...

EKO = dwell
HABITA = dwell
INKOLA = resident
KO-HABITA = live together
PARA = beside
PAROKIA = neighborhood
VICINA = neighborhood

And probably some others if I followed synonyms. I'd favor something
like "parokia-pe" or "para-inkola", which nicely bring together the
ideas of nearby+residence+people.

I have great fun every time I dig into that Glosa dictionary!
Just wish I could find the time and motivation to *write* in Glosa...

    And I disagree with your disagreement.  Where does that leave 
us? ;-)  Actually, I thought of 'para-pe' before I looked it up in 
the volume "Central Glosa: 5000 English into Glosa 1000 with
Etymological Notes."  It seems good enough to me.  Here we get into 
the thorny question of how much vocabulary is enough (and how much
specificity is specific enough)?  I wish I knew more about pidgins
(there is some about Tok Pisin on the www), which seem to do quite 
well with a limited vocabulary.

Teeheehee! Well, you've got the authors on you side. I'll just have to
use Literary Glosa when I talk about my neighbors.

Very thorny! No problem once you *learn* things like "para-pe" = "neighbor".
But if you have to *learn* them, then 1) you've lost some of the utility
of agglutination and 2) you might just as well have a separate word for
the term.

I'm afraid "para-pe" didn't come to me naturally. I need to include
something about "residence". To me, "beside-person" brings to mind
a spouse or co-worker (figurative) or the passenger sitting next to
me on a plane (literal).

Makes me wonder if agglutination-type wordbuilding really works well
between cultures that don't already have a lot in common. In the early
stages anyway. Once you're familiar with it, *any* language can work.
The question is, how long will it take to reach that point?

> ...I wish I knew more about pidgins

Yes, I *must* take a look at Tok Pisin someday. I keep hearing about it
but haven't yet found the time to investigate (or thought of it when I
did!).

Saluta,

I'd go for para-pe to loosely mean (home-)neighbour, co-worker, etc.,
but still allow para-inkola (cool word) when precision was required.

I strongly agree.  I only feel comfortable understanding a Glosa sentence when
I see the noun - verb boundary, and I detect this with my sense of English
language
(arghh) rather than some objective means.  Is the Vorlin.nu minimal grammar
approach
better than Glosa "no" grammar attempt??  I feel three types of word (or types of
word usage)...
1) adverb / adjective / gerund / noun
2) verb / preposition
3) interjection
The comma alone could maybe be used to distinguish these.

Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:
a strongly skilled woman
a strong skilled woman

    Why not just recast the phrase?  There is nothing writ large in the
nature of the universe which says says that any non-English language
has to mimic English word for word.  I would suggest that learners of
any non-native language avoid that habit of trying to translate word
for word.  This was drummed into me in elementary French class
thirty-seven years ago.

I like the Vorlin approach, but I'm not very familiar with Vorlin.
(Have you seen the new site at http://www.vor.nu/vornet/index.html?)
But the Glosa way is to use order within the sentence rather than affixes.

> Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:

Using Glosa's head-finalness, those three ideas in that order would
parse as...

   ( strong ( skill woman ) )

1) As Paul points out, you could rearrange the first sentence.

2) Or find an adverby Glosa word for the "strong" part, but I don't
   really like that idea.

3) How about linking the first two...

   a strong-skill woman

Saluta,

Adverbs are not just European, they are universal and are used to
provide a higher level of structure than simple linear {adjective}-noun.

Consider "a very good person" = ((big good) person)

A language needs somehow to identify the inner pair of brackets.  It could:
0) ignore them and use two sentences instead (too clumsy)
1) ignore them and let context assist (too risky)
2) dictionnary define some "(big" as a LINK-NEXT (ie adverb) rather
 than a LINK-LAST (ie adjective) (too much rote learning)
3) tag the space between big and good
 eg Esperanto:
    bona homo -> a good person
    multE bona homo -> a very good person (bigLY good person)
4) indicate the inner brackets
 eg Chinese:
    hao ren -> a good person
    hen hao DE ren -> a very good person
5) let the adverb be a declination on the adjective
 eg BSL
    gVoEoRdY person

Glosa could maybe use an affix, big-good person, but this mechanism is already
used
to form new words (para-pe etc)

Aaron.

Ahh, 'popina' = "cook-shop"; I found it in _Glosa 6000_.  Well, I cheat,
and my first port of call is the Langenscheidt _Shorter Latin Dictionary_:
this word has been lifted totally from Latin.

    popina, ae f cook-shop, eating house, low tavern; food sold at a 
     cook-shop. 

   I'd say the American "diner" or the Chinese "chop-suey joint" would
cover it; but, who would have thought the Romans coined the phrase, "Let's
pop-in for something to eat."

"a" --> "ad" only before a vowel; subsequent "pa" can be elided if
'pastness' is clear, and its absence aids flow and rhythm; similarly "u"
can be elided when the syntax clearly indicates an object, and its absence
aids rhythm.

    I use the phrase 'comfortable in the mouth' to describe, to myself, how

    There is every reason for retaining the use of  parokia , the less

alternative usages for the Simple Past, in English, viz did run, has run,

     pa kurso - ran, did run, has run

*   More or less, so.  I would check the Functional Grammar books before
making any pronouncement, but there are two factors to juggle: different
Glosa words relating to time, and the gist/intent/emphasis being put across.
  nu  - at this moment  ................anywhere, depending on emphasis
  tem  - at the time, as, while, time(N)  ...  general 'time' word, used
    according to syntax, depending on which Part-of-Speech it functions as
  seqe  - following, subsequently  /
  po | post  - after  ............/  usually function as prepositions
  freqe  - often, frequently     /     but can be 'adverbs' at start
  usuali  - usually  ............. normally an 'adverb' before a 'verb'

    Because Glosa has a Syntax-based, Functional-type Grammar, word order
is strongly related to semantic significance, and, in general - in a simple
sentence - we can say the more important concepts come first.  Note the
difference in feeling between:-
    Nu, na nece akti u-ci.  .......... & .....  Na nece akti u-ci, nu.   
    Now, we must do this.  ...........   .....  We must do this now.

>6) Am I right in thinking there is little distinction between adjectives

>
*   More or less, so; and definitely yes, in that order.
    Glosa has two main word groupings: substantives (concept-words) and
function words.  The former comprise words with a distinct 'flavour', those
that have lexical strength; the latter comprise the small, finite group of
words that facilitate communication and clarify the relationships between
the substantives used.  [N.B. I avoid technical Linguistic terminology to
sidestep being caught in the snares of preconceived definitions.]
    The substantives can (within reason) function as any P-o-S, and this
usage is indicated by position.  So, the substantives can denote things,
actions or descriptions: Nouns, Verbs, or Modifiers.
    The standard Transitive sentence has S-V-O order, and this translates
into:-
  (S) Noun Phrase - (V) Verb Phrase - (O) Noun Phrase
--EG  U .... gina   .......... bate   un .......... andra.
----  U rusu gina   .....forti bate   u bruno derma andra.
  ________|________________|______________|_____|_________ (Modifiers)

Note: Here  derma  describes  andra  and is functioning as an adjective, so
the English equivalent of the phrase would be "the brown-skinned man".
    Also, in Glosa, modifiers precede the words they modify ... which does
cause trouble with some adverbs for speakers of English.  When 'thinking in
Glosa' one does not think of the 'adverb' last.

>7) Finally, I have to come down in favor of using the verb gene or es with
>the prefix ge-.  I do not feel ge- by itself is enough. It seems to me

*   So far so good.  I also prefer the full 'verb' (gene | es) with the
'participle'  ge- .  Where 'state of being' has the strength of an
'adjective' then  ge-  does put an Object - somewhere else in the sentence - 
into the 'state' indicated by the  ge-SUBSTANTIVE  compound, which is a
functional participle.

Reflexive, EG Id frakto-se.  It broke itself.  This is the impersonal form;
when talking about people, we use  -auto, EG An bate-auto.  He hit himself.
   se  can occur on its own, but I have not used it as such.  But  se face
seems more like "self-made" to me.  Try some sentences out on us and we

    About three of four years ago, when Conlang was the only 'constructed
language' List, the question of New Guinea pidgin came up, so I went to
Sydney U. to do a bit of reading about it.  My feeling is that the way NGP
combines the word-pool of English with the way New Guinea people think is
quite creative, but it looks distinctly like a compromise and a 'make do.'
Glosa, on the other hand is not a forced marriage of quite different
language traditions, and so ought to 
be consistent, streamlined ... and then creative.
    So, I guess I would say that the pidgin tradition does not, as far as I
can see, have anything to teach us about how to construct Glosa.
    But when it comes to the 'full' Glosa, then I believe we should have
more choice in the concepts we can use.  The whole range of possibilities
should be open to us:
  para-pe
  vicini-pe 
  parokia-pe
  proxi-pe
  ....
  cyber-ami
  nexu-pe
    How might I say, "We neighbour on the Net"?  Na nexu epi u Reti. ??

articles as boring overkill and a serious case of Linguistic redundancy,
and I have been convinced that I should use a lighter hand where these are
concerned.
    But I am not convinced, yet, that 'omitting' "pa" and "u" is
Linguistically Correct (LC); it could still just be a case of 'heavy elision.'
    And so, I occupy the compromise position.  Although "pa-noktu" does set
the scene in the past, I believe that the first use of the tense particle
in a Verb Phrase is called for, and is LC ... prior to the omission of
following tense particles in the same sentence - as being either completely
'redundant', or optionally 'elided.'  And for naive learners, I would not
elide any of the function words.  Deb Pollard shows that she has intuited
this 'vernacular' usage, so I would not, now that Paul has convinced me,
suggest that she goes back to ^kindergarten^ by including the tense
particle in the second Verb Phrase.

     The only function word I would feel happy with eliding, here, is the

    It's not merely a question of elision.  Some languages never use
them in the first place, so far as I know, so elision does not enter
into the picture.  Why is it somehow "right" for anglophones to use the
function words as in English and not for others to use Glosa as in
their native habits?

    I don't find anything at all wrong in this.  It differs from
English usage, yes, but why is it somehow "wrong"?  Are you taking the
linguistic-chauvinistic position that only the English way of doing
things is somehow "the right way"?

    Why does it have to be either/or?  Why can it not be correct in its
own right?

    I.e., speak like English.  Then why not have them put forth a
little more effort, learn English as the auxiliary, and put Glosa on
the rubbish heap?

    I will have to think about this one for a bit, just because I am
myself a native English-speaker and get involved in this all the time
without considering.  However, right off the top of my head I recall
some Russian adult learners of English who tended to use English tenses
as they seemed to think they would correspond to Russian aspect usage. 
For instance, I once heard one Russian consistently use "He has been
such-and-such" when a native anglophone would simply say "He was" for
someone who was dead.  In Russian, I suppose, one would use the perfect
aspect to indicate that something was over and done with, whereas in 
English we would not mark the aspect at all.  (English "He was" might
be used wither for a perfective or imnperfective aspect.)

*   The "para-pe" generic 'neighbour' is a "Glosa 1000" solution to the
problem of delimiting the lexicon.  How many neighbours, and hence
neighbourhoods, will be needed in a 'functional-enough' ~2K "Learners'
Dictionary"?
    While 'neighbour' conveys, in the abstract, "the next person", then
*para-pe* suffices.  But, there are so many cultural differences between
neighbourhoods around the globe, that we possibly have to decide if Glosa
will blandly lump them all into  para-pe  or whether we will have to go
specific so we can say,
EG  Mi ski holo mi plu para-pe, e plura de plu vicina-pe intra plu via;
proxi mi domi, sed mi ne ski holo plu parokia-pe; qi habita mi suburba.

   I know all of my immediate neighbours, and several of the local people
in the streets around my home, but I do not know all of the residents, who
inhabit my suburb.

Then, again, if we live in a village, we are more likely to say,
EG  Mi ski holo plu persona de mi viki: mu es holo para-pe a mi.  Mi dice
ko holo plu inkola de mi viki; e mi parokia extende a plu parokia-viki
intra u vicina.

    I know all of the people of my village: they are all neighbours to me. 
I speak to all of the residents of my village, and my neighbourhood extends
to the neighbouring villages in the vicinity.

>We have...

*   Surely that is the intention in creating an open-plan language like
Glosa.  What we must do as a priority, is to sort out the 'optimal' number
of ''other-people'' grouping CONCEPTS needed for the first offering of a
language intended for a world of varied "other-people groupings."

    Step 1: think in Glosa.  Juggle the concepts you want to use, throw
them into the air, and let them fall .. as words in a sentence.

    My method of working is the Australian way, which is somewhat opposite

There could be a cultural difference between us at work, here.

The specificity, as I see it, is different for a *functional* dictionary
from more satisfyingly fuller dictionary.  I believe that we would do
better to be working at the concept level, than at the level of words.
    Agreed concepts are conveyed by words, but, somewhere along the line,
we need to decide on the match-up between concepts and words.  In my book,
the ideas which we want to convey should be primary to the words we use to
convey them.  I know this is not the way languages emerged in the wild;
but, now, with hindsight, and with some degree of urgency in seeking a
solution to the World Languge Problem, I think we need to go back to the
Roget approach, and look at language communication from the concept point
of view.
    Back at having discrete words for each concept vs. using agglutination
to form hyphenated compounds: Glosa is already a blend of both; and I feel
that we need to allow 'nature' to take its course, so that while there are
words derived using both methods, we ought to allow usage to sort out which
words will survive.  Even though compounding is part of the Glosa story, we
still need to understand the same thing from the same compound for
effective communication to occur.  My belief is that compounding works best
if the component words are well founded as concepts before compounding
takes place.  From this, the idea of word-translation dictionaries for
Glosa, does not assist in concept clarifictation, which needs the fuller
definitions found in normal dictionaries.
    With no grant for such work, we could seriously follow up the
suggestion, made by Paul, for more modifying words in the Glosa (word-list)
dictionaries, to allow a fuller understanding of the meanings intended for
Glosa words.

*   There is a place in our communication system for the 'generic'
"neighbour", and I feel that  para-pe  is as good as any, for this.  
    If sombody shouted, very loudly:
 Tena u manu de tu para-pe!  or more simply  Tena tu para-pe manu!

you would very quickly get the urgency of the situation, and grab the hand
of the person next to you.
    With less urgency, we very likely will want to be more specific about
who it is we relate to, and how far out from us the action, or
relationship, extends.  In such, more normal situations, a larger range of
choices would seem necessary .. both in relation to the people to whom we
are relating, and the distance from us, that the relationship extends.

I must see if we can find a group of non-Indo-European-based Glosa-pe who
are ready to enter into correspondence with Glosalist subscribers, for the
purpose of our 'using' the language to find answers to such questions.
    Such Glosa-pe would, however, be practising Glosa as it is, and would
not be likely to want to spend lots of time discussing Linguistic aspects
of the language.  I am not sure how many List members would be interested
in such field research: I know Paul would.

be spelled out.

In English, incorrect omissions. But when it comes to Glosa *used as an
IAL*, I'm in favor of the telegrammatic style that Paul advocates and
Chinese uses (well, Chinese is telegrammatic as compared to English,
though of course to the Chinese it's not telegrammatic at all!). The
very fact that the telegrammatic style works in telegrams is proof that
the extra words are, indeed, extra. And I think it would be much easier
for the student if such extra words were 1) not compulsory but were also
2) permissible, as long as the student understands that they might cause
confusion.

Thus, those whose native language does not use such words would not have
to learn this foreign way of speech, and those whose native language *does*
use them could simply be told to just try to speak more telegrammatically.

Extra words would also be quite useful in Literary Glosa.

Ah, I think I see! Your "neighbour" is generic, more inclusive, and
*could* mean "spouse", "co-worker", "passenger in the seat next to you",
or "person who resides next to you". Context would make that work. In fact,
it would be a very handy literary device. But if I were to say "See her?
She's my beside-person.", you really wouldn't know her relationship to me.
As with the example in the Basic Reference: "The woman; who is going
around the corner; is my neighbor.".

So, we're talking about two different things. You're talking about a
reflexive kind of situation, or a literary reference, but I'm talking
absolutely.

Yippee! We're both right, we both win!

Except for one thing. When somebody looks up "neighbor" in the dictionary,
what should the corresponding Glosa word be? Perhaps both "vicina-pe" and
"para-pe" should be listed, with the latter marked as "generic" or some
such thing.

Me too! It might be of more interest, though, to see how beginners deal
with it. As I said before, *any* language works once you learn it. The
practicing Glosafolk are using it as they have learned to use it. The
fact that it works doesn't prove that it is the best way or the easiest
to learn or to use. (Unless their style is *not* by the book. Deviations
would be of considerable interest!)

(Somebody once said that *anything* is regular if the rules are complicated
enough!)

I said...
> Once you're familiar with it, *any* language can work.
> The question is, how long will it take to reach that point?

...to which Robin replied...

(Since I realized our different approaches to the word "neighbor",
some of the specifics in the following paragraph aren't relevant,
but the logic still applies for explaining my lead-in-time remarks.)

Well, that wasn't quite the point I wished to make. As it stands, if I
learn "para" and "pe", I also have to learn what a "para-pe" is, because
it doesn't contain the concept of "residence" and thus doesn't mean
"neighbor" to me. I get three words for the price of three. But if I
learn "parokia" and "pe", then "parokia-pe" is pretty straightforward;
three words for the price of two. And I've also gained another link in my
mind to "para"! I believe that this sort of regularity would make Glosa
easier to learn, and without it, Glosa will suffer a long lead-in time.

Similar arguments can be made for "vicina-pe" and "inkola-pe".

This sort of analysis is why I have so much fun with the Glosa dictionary,
but it is also why I always burn out and have to put it away for a while!

*   Yes.  Bill is simply using the agglutinative principle, as it applies
to Glosa compounding, correctly.  And the join, _heard_ as a short "gap"
between the component words, is _seen_ by the human, or computer, reader as
a hyphen.

*   Well, in a well-turned Glosa sentence, the substantive acting as a noun
 - just before the start of the Verb Phrase - marks this boundary.  And, if
we are in the Past, this start of the Verb Phrase is very likely to be a
"pa," ... two markings of the boundary!?

*   Funny thing though, English has only five verbal inflections, and its
grammar is 50% Syntax-based.  This could be your reason, Aaron, for finding
English uncomfortably close to Glosa.  Glosa does the Syntax-based Grammar
thing right: in English, however, Syntax-based Grammar "sort-of" evolved,
and is still breaking away from the inflected German grammar that was added
by the Anglo-Saxons.

*   More information on Vorlin.nu required: some of us have only time for

structure and this is the foundation of its Syntax-based grammar.  We all
apologise for the mis-statment of "no MORPHOLOGICAL grammar" as "no grammar."

*   Without examples in Glosa or simple English, I cannot 'understand' this
schema.  No time to run through the combination of the all possible
interpretations that your groupings conjure up.
    Rearanging  1) , slightly, I give EG
 quickly running old man  (ADV/G/ADJ/N)
 celero kurso paleo andra

   This is the Noun Phrase minus its Determinant, "The" or "a" or "Several"
(U | plu).  Please note:  andra  does not agree in number with its
determinant  u  or  plu; also,  andra  is the only logical 'noun' in the
whole four-word group .. it is the 'culmination' of the Noun Phrase, and,
as such is the Linguistically 'Final' "Head," .... and the terminal
boundary of the Noun Phrase in Glosa.
   While the casual reader might say that all of these words are
substantives, and that the grouping is a "concept cluster" and, thus,
semantically too dense, I ask the non-casual reader to notice that the
words follow a clear-cut sequence of increasing significance, and that the
order is Syntactically correct, and cannot be changed.
    Aaron, I suggest that the most direct path to the Glosa truth is for us
to accept that words are basically all concepts, and that each concept
could concievably function as any part of speech: after having decided to
use this as a working hypothesis, we can then say that the surface
structure, or syntax, gives us the ^lie of the land^ and indicates the
particular way a word is being used in a specific instance (is it
incarnating as a verb, noun, modifier, or what); and, then, we apply
'hidden power' by allowing our "language centres" in the brain to go to
work, and sort out the deep structure, or semantics, of the sentence - to
*understand* what the sentence's words really mean.
    Perhaps speaking and writing Glosa is the reverse of the above process.

>Regarding adverbs, how to distinguish the following:
>a strongly skilled woman
>a strong skilled woman
>
*   We will agree on  "U .............. gina."  but what goes between; and
even more importantly, does the rest of the message need to be tightly
squeezed into that space?
    And why should we not consider the possibility of 
 a skilled strong woman  and
 a skilfully strong woman  as well?

   There is an underlying pattern in all of these phrases:-
 LEAST IMPORTANT / MORE IMPORTANT / EVEN MORE IMPORTANT / MOST IMPORTANT

That is how it goes in English, and that is basically how it goes in Glosa.
But, in Glosa, without the "-ly", "-ed" and "-fully" Part-of-Speech
markers, we might need to be a bit more basic in our sentence structure -
not having the sophistication of using such inflections.
    We can juggle  forti  and  tekno - throwing words, instead of balls,
into the air - but we might, just might, have to spell out the relationship
between these concepts, to ensure that we have conveyed the right meaning.
    The need to think about what you want to say - before saying it - is, I
fear, the major ^culture-shock^ when entering Glosaland.  After achieving a
regularity of morphology .. for various believed advantages .. we then have
to pay the price of this 'elegance' by using a more *descriptive* style in
our sentence formation.  So, here are my attempts at the phrases in
question  EG
 a strongly skilled woman  ...  u gina; qi habe plu forti ge-developo tekno
 a strong skilled woman  .....  u forti, ge-tekno gina
    a skilled strong woman  ..  u ge-tekno, forti gina
    a skilfully strong woman    u gina; qi uti fe forti ko tekno

    Maybe, in English, we place the Adverb last because it is the remnant
of an elided Adverbial Clause.  ... purely an unsubstantiated theory.  In
Glosa, we have not had sufficient usage of the language to make such heavy
elision current, yet.  Perhaps it will come; but, for the moment, it is
probably best to *spell out* what we are trying to say, so that our
readers, or listeners, have no trouble in following our drift.

    So, let me say straight out,
  u fo boni persona  =  a very good person

    Aaron, I believe that you have fallen into the trap, all too common in
Western Scholarship, of over-intellectualising the situation.  And here are
a few details backing up my sentence, above:-
   forti [strong]
   fo [strong (abbreviated form)]
   boni [good]  ..................are all 'modifiers', IE they add to the
meaning of another substantive, usually a 'noun' or a 'verb'.  However,
here, we see a modifier modifying another modifier: is this mouthfull
permissible in Glosa?  Of course it is.
   The only Grammatical Rule that the authors have published is:
     "A word is modified by its precedent."

   This is not much to go by, but it does lead directly into 'Head Final'
phrase structure - something I had to figure out for myself; it also tells
us that 
" ... fo boni ..." is OK.
   Is it a $good$ which is $very$, or do we suspend judgment, and wait to
see what the next word is, only to discover that we have a #person# who is
primarily #good#, and secondarily #very OR strongly so#?
   On top of all that, I would see a distinction between the concepts of
"big" and "very": we might describe somebody as 'Mr Big' but never as 'Mr
Very'; this suggests to me that there is a semantic category difference
between these concepts.  My guess is that  mega [big]  is a substantive
while  fo [very]  is a function word.  This probably explains why we are
more likely to read of a  fo mega andra  than of a  mega fo andra .
   I believe that your mathematical approach to language is not the right
one for understanding the structure of Glosa.  As children, we spend years
'understanding' how we are supposed to juxtaspose words in our sentences,
then, as educated adults, we carry on, as normal, 'knowing' that the way we
sequence our words in sentences is 'obviously right.'
   What makes both Chinese and English hard for learners is the
'naturalistic' uninflected grammar.  Glosa ^joins the club^ - only moreso -
with NO inflections, and a word order that is also assumed to be close to
the 'natural.'
   The difference between the two natlangs and Glosa is that the natlangs
evolved, or devolved, to their 'natuarlistic', mainly uninflected, forms,
while Glosa was 'hatched' under ^pressure-cooker^ conditions to simulate
this 'naturalness' in language.  Did Clark and Ashby get it right: are they
even close?  Only practice will tell!
   Hence, in my understanding of the R&D situation, as it applies to Glosa,
we are now in the "Application" (or Verification) stage of the language's
development.  As such, I am very interested to see how the language fits
the mouths of common people .. as it is.  The authors assumed that the
language was ready to be picked up by the man, woman and child in the
street, but they had not taken into account the Linguist in the road.

>A language needs somehow to identify the inner pair of brackets.  It >could:
>0) ignore them and use two sentences instead (too clumsy)
*  Agreed about the clumsiness, but not that language contains the
mathematical sort of bracketting that you suggest.

>1) ignore them and let context assist (too risky)
*  The authors trusted the people's cerebration more than you do; this was
the sort of risk they were prepared to take.

>2) dictionnary define some "(big" as a LINK-NEXT (ie adverb) rather
> than a LINK-LAST (ie adjective) (too much rote learning)
*   As stated above, the authors go for each word in a phrase impinging on
the next, sequentially ... seeing concepts affecting concepts in a forward
direction, rather than Adverbs modifying Adjectives, as we have been taught
to do in English.

>3) tag the space between big and good
> eg Esperanto:
>    bona homo -> a good person
>    multE bona homo -> a very good person (bigLY good person)
*  With all respect to Esperanto, I see that as their problem.  Glosa tries
to see the "good person" as simply a  boni persona [good person], and a
"very good person" as a  fo boni persona [very good person].
    No *tag* seems necessary, or correct, to impede the modification
process in Glosa.

>4) indicate the inner brackets
> eg Chinese:
>    hao ren -> a good person
>    hen hao DE ren -> a very good person
*   Though I do not follow what is happening, here, in Chinese, I am going
to ^play^ the "Recency Card" and say that, with hindsight, and the benefit
of recent thinking in Linguistics (since it became a 'science'), the Glosa
authors have ''streamlined'' language usage as much as they feel people can
bear, and have attempted to iron out the wrinkles that have built up,
through usage, in the national languages.

>5) let the adverb be a declination on the adjective
> eg BSL
>    gVoEoRdY person
>
>Glosa could maybe use an affix, big-good person, but this mechanism is
>already used to form new words (para-pe etc)
>
*   fo  is already an affix; this case was argued by some in previous
discussions in the Conlang list.  There is no hyphen, and  fo  has the
structure of a full word, but it is bound to the following word by the
mythical Rules of Syntax; so, in Glosa we have the best of both worlds.
    Though there might possibly be a BSL, I would have a lot of trouble
speaking it, with its UPPER/lower case mix, so I suspect that you are
finishing off your blip with an EXfTRuEMnELnYy joke.

Yes, but while examining the Glosa 6000 I came across things like...

 AMI = friend
 AMIKA = friendly
 FILEMON = friendly or loving

 EKINO or SOLOX = bristly
 HORIDO = bristling
 KAETA or SETA = bristle

...which may just be misleading, but it appears to indicate that some
words are to be thought of as adjectives, some as nouns, etc. Could AMI
be used as an adjective, or AMIKA as a noun? Well, probably, particularly
if used to form a compound. So perhaps what we've discovered here is that
there is yet another group of hidden synonyms in Glosa. Oh no!

This well-turning could be tricky though, and critical, because if any
word can be any part of speech, how can you know when you've reached the
end of the phrase? (Reminds me of the old joke about spelling "Mississippi":
I *know* how to spell it; I just don't know when to stop!) One has to make
a determined effort to somehow mark the Head of the "Head Final". A "pa"
marking the beginning of the verb phrase would certainly mark the end of
the noun phrase. Or the first word that could not logically be used as a
noun could perform the same function. This gives a lot of importance to
the words that cannot logically be interpreted as any part of speech (can
somebody think of a good word for that?) in a language that is based on
words that can!

That's *exactly* how I'd do it. It creates a little head-final kind of
compound word and then applies it to another word in a head-final phrase.

To me, those two uses are the same.

I don't think of compound words as separate words in their own right; at
least, I don't think they should be. If the root words are precise enough,
and the compounds are created carefully enough, then the meaning of a
compound should be obvious. But I have retained many compounds in the
dictionary (and added some for completeness) because 1) sometimes the
compounds are *not* obvious (purpleberries!) and 2) I think they make
the dictionary more useful.

By modifiers, do you mean that they are *Modifiers* or that they are acting
as modifiers in this sentence? Could "forti" or "boni" ever be the Head?
When it is said that "Glosa words can be used, within reason, as any part
of speech", I fear that maybe I'm not sufficiently reasonable!

What's bothering me tonight is: Glosa seems to have an awful lot of words
that *cannot* act as *any* part of speech. And they seem to be necessary,
since there is no other way of marking the heads of the phrases. Is it
*possible* to have a head-final concept-word language with no method of
marking the heads? 

(That's why I say that I probably push this concept-word idea farther
than the authors had in mind.)

Another troublesome aspect: if FORTI and its synonyms cannot be used
as nouns, and the nouns are just nouns and the verbs just verbs, then
we are left with ROBORA for the verb and VIS for the noun. Beauty, but
not simplicity. Three forms of the same concept without any obvious
relationship. It seems to me that it might be simpler to learn a regular
inflection or a handful of POS markers/affixes to apply to concept-word
roots. In fact, couldn't one say that the FORTI/ROBORA/VIS example
demonstrates a highly irregular and inflected language?

*   These statements are relevant to the Glosa situation.  The authors have
purposely not printed a Grammar Book, and have published only one
grammatical rule: that a word is modified by its precedent.  This has shown, 
among the Third World Glosa-pe, that the language does live even without a
^smack on the bottom^ from a heavy grammar-book.  However, this experiment
has proved counter-productive among the First World would-be-Glosa-pe, who
feel that Glosa needs a ^life support system^ to make it live, for them.
    The Ugandans are using Glosa "not by the book", because there is
virtually no book to go by.   I was asked by Peter Kwagala for some help
with a few "seminars" on Glosa's usage, and that was in 1995; after a
serious lapse, I will resume the process, with 'Seminar #2', ' .. #3', and
so on.
    As an experiment run under very extreme conditions, I feel that Glosa
showed, with statistical significance, that it works without complicated
rules.  However, the experiment was, I feel, very costly - in that for
those not in "extreme conditions" an un-Booked Glosa did not reach the
significance level, of workability.
    And that's where we are, now, in the Glosalist: I am trying to vivify
Glosa with "life support" in an ad hoc manner.  The modification of a " 'no
grammar'" Hypotesis 1, is a "syntax by seminars" Hypothesis 2.  This second
experiment ought to gain an even higher significance rating for Glosa's
workability in the Third World, and might even raise workability to
significance in the First.

"understand and work out".  The 'cut-off point' is IAL adoption, and we are
IMHO much closer to this now that we were in 1881, when Esperanto kicked
off.  It is my belief that Glosa needs to enable people to reach fluency
quicker than does Esperanto, because there may not be 'five years' between
now and when the machinery for IAL adoption is set in place, with, of
course, the major player in the 'highly probable' slot.

*   With the wizardry of electronic databases, such improvements to the
Glosa dictionary are instantaneous, and a finger-press away.  I feel that
the "neighbour" moity can be sorted out very quicly, as it seems to have
been done on Glosalist, and adjustments to the dictionary can be made using
suitable qualifiers.  How do I translate "next-door neighbour" into Glosa,
anyway?  Possibly ~para-domi-pe~ simmers down to ~para-do-pe~.
    Bill, you are putting up the case for spefic terminology, and fairly
regularised rules for the derivation of words; I seem to be quoting the
case for flexibility in concept-building.  I have the feeling that this is,
as you observed earlier a win-win situation: some people will use Glosa in
the concrete, and others will, as happens with most modern languages,
polarise their usage to the abstract; with time, and suitable
encouragement, others, again, will discover that they have, within Glosa,
the flexibility to chose the specificty of the word they want to use.
    But getting back to basics, we cannot hit Glosa learners on the head
with the Glosa equivalent of the Full Oxford English Dictionary.  I feel
that we should be fairly specific and restricted in range, in the Glosa
Staters' Dictionary, but that there ought to be a few non-specifics
included, to show learners that abstraction is alive and well in Glosa, also.

*   Firstly, I would say that in general use, the basic rule as enunciated,
above, holds for most of the Glosa lexicon.   
    While  amika  and  filemon  may be Classical synonyms, perhaps this
represents a historical cultural difference, with the Greeks being more
affectionate in their friendliness.
    I have tried to avoid the ^square corner^ approach in my use of the
Glosa lexicon, and have, possibly slackly, used  ami  and  amika  almost
interchangably, choosing whichever felt best in a particular sentence.  The
alternative view is that  amika  is the full substantive word, while  ami
is the abbreviated form.

*   I think we are falling down the crack between 'syntax' and 'semantics.'
The Glosa rules relate to syntax; and, on an Internet List, like this one,
the syntax can be seen - easily - on screen, but the semantics are not so
readily discerned.  My guess is that Semanticists have had a lot to say
about lexical items that are 'dedicated' to functionas only one part of
speech.  And I would guess that at a later phase of Glosa research, we will
give the language the full treatment of Semantic analysis, possibly along
the lines of Functional Grammar.  However, at present, I go along with the
authors, and am trying to get away with letting the brain of the Glosa-pe
sort it out.
   If any word could possibly function as any part of speech, but, in
reality, we know that many words don't, then for normal language usage we
are guided by common sense in this.  We have "But me no buts!" but not "To
me no to-es."
   I still find it very convenient (not a good Linguistic term) to use
inverted commas when assigning a word its Part-of-Speech in Glosa, EG
   Kurso dona mega hedo.
    kurso - 'noun' (= word functioning as a NOUN)
    dona  - 'verb' 
    mega  - modifier: 'adjective'
    hedo  - 'noun'

Most of these words can function as other Parts-of-Speech:  kurso  is
usually a 'verb';  dona  can be an 'adjective' or even a 'noun; we usually
see  hedo  in its 'adjective' [happy] incarnation, but it can be a 'noun'
[hapiness] as here.    mega  will only very seldom, if at all, be a thing
or an action, so is dedicated to the "comparative" function and will almost
always be an 'adjective', or rarely, an 'adverb'.  Lumping all such
'dedicated' words into the "funtion word" category might be a bit crass,
but it lets us get on with seeing Seantics in two broad categories: but is
this enough of a classificatory division?  Some words are always verbs, and
others always prepositions; while the authors believe that people have the
language ability to sort these categories out automatically, is this
classification something we should be doing now?  Personally, I believe
that attempting to use the language in all its uncertainties, is more
important, at present, than dotting every "I" and crossing every "T",
metaphorically speaking, of course.

    I suspect that most people will use Glosa without realising that there
is a problem with identifying the "Head", or with wondering how far the
function of a word can spread.
    An habe ta forti; an sio pote trakto id ad u sola.
   [He has so much strength, he could pull it to the ground.]
           ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I would call "forti" the Head of a Noun Phrase, here.  

    Fe pa akti id pro u demo boni.
   [She did it for the people's good.]
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Likewise, "boni" is the Head of a phrase here.

think that the "reason" here can be equated with the old cover-all, "common
sense."

    Yes, in trying to make the rules for words universal, the authors have
possibly over-generalised the situation.  I am certain that they were
expecting the 'man, woman and child' in the street to apply their inherent
linguistic abilities to the situation, knowing that, for example, they
could not used "ad" as a verb.  
    One can list all of the possible P-o-S usages of a word, and this would
be a proper way for computer programmers to go about doing it.  The
_Collins Cobuild Essential Dictionary_ does just this: it has a special
column down the side in which the exact P-o-S usage is noted for every
listing of a word; it makes the whole language thing very complicated.

get the rhythm of it, to tell us where one phrase ends and the next starts.
 This could be a demonstration of somatic knowlege being superior to
intellectual knowlege.
    Glosa, of course, is designed to make use of this 'feel' for language,
also.

Oooh, I need to take a look at that! (Yep, I'm a programmer, that's me.)
But does it actually make language more complicated, or less, or even
have no effect at all? Maybe just makes language *appear* more complicated.
One way of looking at it (descriptively) is that such a dictionary merely
codifies practice. If you're unsure, you can look it up. It may look
difficult seen all together at once, but it's really just a textbook
description of what folks are saying anyway. Well, perhaps I should say no
more until I actually look at it!

It's just a dictionary problem. If you look up "strong", you find "forti"
but not the others; if you look up "strengthen" you find "robora" but not
the others; if you look up "strength" you find "vis" but not the others.
They are, of course, synonyms (eek!), but to users whose language is not
concept-word-oriented, the segregation makes it appear that these are
different forms of the same word, but wildly different from one another.

Synonyms don't make irregularity. (It was a joke! (That was the thesis!)
(But it could go something like this...))

Root word (noun): VIS = strength

To form a verb: If the leading character is V, drop the leading V- and
append -ORA, the verbal suffix. Substitute R for leading vowels. If two
consonants are found to be adjacent, replace the second with -OB- since
this is easier to pronounce. Thus, "robora". (If the leading character
is not V, see page 231, paragraph 4.)

To form an adjective: If, during construction of the verbal form, a
secondary consonant was replaced by the -OB- infix, then begin by dropping
the final consonant, if the word contains a consonant. See Table XIII
for consonantal shifts; in this case, F replaces leading V. And remember,
whenever a word might consist of only a consonant and a vowel, the infix
-ORT- (Organic Recyclable Trash, according to my daughter, or "leaving,
refuse" in Old or Middle English, I can't remember which and can't find
my source) must be inserted between them. Thus, "forti".

And I before E except where it isn't.
