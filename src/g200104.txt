Dear Charles,

Yes, I think there is an awkward self-overestimation in this point, 
that damages Glosa's reputation and so the spread of the language.  

Look what Wendy wrote to Alexander (see his email 01-02-11):  "Ron pa 
dice Ruso-lingua fo boni e fo amo tu lingua.  Mali-fortuna an ne pa 
habe pote de grafo tu alfabeta per an puta-me; seqe-co an ne pa proto 
u-ci [the translation of 'Glosa 6000'] ergo." - and she feels 
thoroughly convinced of it.  Their "Deutsch-Glosa 1000"-book is nearly 
unreadable and so I cannot believe, that Ron's Russian would have 
satisfied to write a whole book in it. 

But I do think, they were NOT totally stupid, they have more knowledge 
than me and they did put a lot of work into the Glosa words, more than 
there can be seen in their printed word lists.  Certainly a lot of 
errors in the vocabulary are redactional (language development faster 
than new editions of books) and so perhaps a problem of computer 
usage.  And finally do not forget, more problems are caused than 
solved by the science.  That makes non-scientific inventions likable. 


 > Arbitrary and inextensible. Also anti-mnemonic for Europeans. 

Very extensible: take every -i-word and make it to -a, -e, -o and -u, 
then you have a 4-times-extension!  ;)  -    OK, I know, what you mean 
and you are right.

No, I don't think that either. They dropped morphology,
and that proved both revolutionary and workable.
Their work was as valuable as that of Hogben.

Only someone who has tried to make a conlang knows
how difficult the task is, even using a computer.

Interlingua of Peano had a word selection system
(and it determined final vowels nicely).
Interlingua of Gode has an algorithm to determine
international words. It is almost the same as
that of the earlier Occidental.

Esperanto began with a set of roots and affixes.
It was arbitrary but artistic and consistent. It proved
that less (rules and vocabulary) is more (learnable).

Interglossa had some guidelines for selecting vocabulary,
but it wasn't thorough. Glosa used the Roget's Thesaurus
plus whatever fill-in words occured to the authors.
Compared to other systems, it isn't adequate for use,
but *could* be revised using more modern techniques.

The EuroWordnet project compared vocabularies of several
European languages and identified their most important
shared concepts, much better than Roget:
http://www.hum.uva.nl/~ewn/corebcs/topont.htm

As for English, a huge corpus of data was analyzed
to produce a word-frequency list by part-of-speech:
http://www.itri.bton.ac.uk/~Adam.Kilgarriff/bnc-readme.html
Notice especially his "lemmatized list" which generates
90% of all English vocabulary in actual usage.

I have come to believe, provisionally, that it is necessary
for a useful artificial language to have a base set of
approximately 3000 to 6000 *productive* words. It would
include "cat" but not "lion", because there are too many
specific names of things to give them all primary roots.
Glosa has no morphology, but every lang must have derivation.
So, "big cat", etc.

Interglossa originally had another good idea which has
been lost in Glosa: We don't need more than a very limited
number of verbs, perhaps only 20 to 100. This is valid
because most verbs (approximately 5000 in European languages)
are composed of a "light verb" that incorporates a noun
and/or direction. So factor them out, and things get simple
fast. Asian langs do this and work very efficiently.

But how to choose which base words are really needed?
I think it is necessary to rely on linguistic science today,
not personal artistic inspiration. Some weighted formula
involving EuroWordnet, BNC, even Roget, and/or other sources
can be tried out by computer and tested and adjusted.
Then it can be published and maintained in the future,
by some committee that will perpetuate Glosa.

It is also possible to design an algorithm matching
equivalent roots in many languages to the chosen concepts.
One could include ancient and modern languages and dialects.
Then maximize recognizability, pronounceability, etc,
by another open (public) algorithm.

This could be done, and should be, by trained linguists.
There are probably 10 available in the world, I even
know of 1 or 2. It has to adhere to the highest possible
standards of science and openness. I think the world
would welcome such an effort, and even use the language.
If a sufficient enthusiastic group of supporters were
to "demand" such a thing, I think it could happen.
(Until then, I prefer a different interlingue.)

Dear Charles,

Thank you for your interesting answer about word-derivation.


You wrote about Interglossa:

Glosa has not lost it.  You can form lovely easy sentences with akti,
es, este, face, habe.  And this method is also good for longer
sentences to make clearer what is the verb.

But Glosa has also the possibility of strong verbs.  And therefore
you do not need a vocabulary extension because of the
no-part-of-speech-concept.  Stronger verbs give better style.  More
life comes in.  Interglossa was poison for poets.

So with Glosa you have both, and I like this hybrid.  But I am angry,
that Ashby and Clark refused to write a grammar.  So the older
Interglossa with its sentence-formulas seems to be clearer, easier and
more scientific than its follower.

But that feature eliminated all confusion that results
from using vague verbs such as "to hammer"; one is forced
to say "use hammer" etc, which is clear and easy to read.

Well, there are always names and particles at a minimum.
Glosa uses "pa/nu/fu" etc excessively just to mark where the
subject ends and the verb begins. But I agree (now) that
eliminating Esperantish a/e/o POS was an improvement.

>  Stronger verbs give better style.  More
> life comes in.  Interglossa was poison for poets.

Poetry is certainly attested in natural pidgin/creoles.
When I try to write in Glosa the particles are awkward.
Strong verbs are an ambiguity-causing problem, IMO,
so I much prefer light verbs without tense particles.

> I am angry, that Ashby and Clark refused to write a grammar.

That problem is most easily remedied, because nobody would try
to stop you from writing one; but it's a bit of work ...

For instance, in English and Chinese the sentence is based on
the SV(O) pattern, but SV can be either transitive or intrans.,
as in "I dropped it, and it dropped (like a stone)".
I don't know which is correct in Glosa, but would guess
it's *different*, therefore English/Chinese speakers must
be taught the rule, or they will mangle it in practice.

sorry I don't use all this <<<<<<<<<< business - will learn sometime 

I've been thinking about glosa grammar for some time having done some 

Urdu/Hindi, Bengla looked very briefly at Welsh etc. I find learning
other 

languages difficult and have tried to put myself into the shoes of a
similar 

person without english and from India. Glosa so far is about the easiest
lang 

 I've come across but partly because it is more or less english with 

different words used (and why not?) however my virtual indian other self 

would not find it so easy 

I seem to need know where the verb phrase starts and ends and the head
word 

so - pa fu and I suggest du for the present ( dura for continuous) 

same with noun - u/plu - it has been suggested that we beg borrow steal
em 

for beginning of direct object - I suggest per to introduce subject. some 

months ago, I loaded you all with something like that. 

(per) un andro du dona (em) plu-r avi ad u gina. 

(em) plu-r avi ad u gina per un andro du dona (like Hindi) .

Karo Amika,

    I did a beautiful reply all in Glosa ... but it was late and I must
have moused the wrong option,

because that reply has disappeared up some untraceable mouse-hole.

   In brief, I suggested that the designers of the mail program Syd uses
did a serious dis-service to the Net by bringing in numbers of vertical
stripes instead of continuing with the clear ">", ">>" etc, system.

   On grammar I tried to say there was a "signpost" system for both Noun
Phrases and Verb Phrases: a N.P. starts with a 'determinant' (u/plu) or a
numerator e.g. ~tri~, ~poli~, ~nuli,  and then fills in with more
substantial words leading to the final substantive "noun"; the V.P.
starting with a tense particle is clearly visible ... ending with the
substantive "verb."

   Trouble comes when there is NO tense particle needed (Simple Present
Tense), and there are no modifiers to indicate that we have a new phrase:
then the V.P. comprises only one word. 


  e.g.   Jon gresi in u parka.

           Jon, gresi in u parka, skope un avi.

           Jon, puta id fu habe gluko flavoro, pa bali u sagita ad un
avi.


  The "descriptive grammar" for Glosa, that I wrote from observation of
Ron and Wendy's prose, combined with my subjective ponderings, may have
got lost.  I think I put it on my website, but will send it to the
Glosalist as an attachment - next post - not as a definitive statement,
but as a point of continuation of the discussion.  

  The question proper formation of sentences in Glosa got the treatment
in my "Seminars" #1 and #2.  These seminars were prepared as a result of
a request, from Africa, for more guidance on the matter of sentence
formation; these were written at a time when Ron was opposed to the
writing of a "Grammar Book", stating that such a thing was unnecessary,
and would only serve to rigidify Glosa, and cause unwanted confusion to
its users.  

  My attempt to "describe" Glosa's grammar came as a result of subjective
frustration, and from taunts out of the Conlang Mailing List, that Glosa
had '''no grammar'''.  As it worked out, I made extensive use of
discussion, with the Conlangers, to refine the descriptive grammar
offered.


  Perhaps I should mention here my one significant addition to the
Linguists' lexicon.  Following much trial and error - with emphasis on
the latter - I finally coined a phrase to describe the style of grammar
found in Glosa: Glosa has 'syntax-based' grammar.  Needless to say such a
phrase is not (as yet) found in the Linguistic literature; however,
something like it will have to be 're-invented' if Glosa is ever to be
recognised by the Linguists, because it does not fit their pre-existing
categories.   Needless to say, well-written Chinese is syntax-based, and
so is 50% of English.


  While I'm at it, perhaps I should say that if Glosa's "grammar" does
depend on syntax, and that people with a better understanding of syntax
would write better Glosa than those who do not have this understanding,
then ... the "Rules of Syntax" will need to be 'taught' to
school-children learning Glosa!  There is only one problem, such syntax
rules do not seem to be available in the general alinguistic literature. 
This is only a small oversight, considering that Simon Pinker and others
researching children's learning of language, have strongly stated that
the one principle running through the learning of all languages is the
brain's hard-wired syntax system.  Some languages are closer to it, while
others are quite sophisticated, and a long way from 'natural syntax.'  If
Ron Clark had not been tapping into something fundamental to human
thinking, how could he have possible stated that Glosa could be used
without first ' ' learning' ' its grammar?

   The closest I have seen, in print, to the 'syntax-based' idea, is the
fairly recent definition of the grammar of English - under the heading,
Functional Grammar.  Of course, grammarians of English have to run two
sets of rule, in parallel, to cover both Latino/Germanic synthetic
grammar and the much simpler uninflected Early British forms.  Am I
unkind, or simply technically correct, in describing English as having a
"bastard grammar"?

   Nedless to say, the simple, uninflected strand of English grammar is
the one perpetuated through Glosa, and this can be observed in academic
fashion in the two "Seminars", the Glosa descriptive grammar and in the
attempt to record observed syntax, non-verbally,  in the GAS (gASCII
Analysed Syntax) system.


   Were we living in "Peace-time" I would spend much of my non-working
time in writing in, and about, Glosa.  However, living in a situation
where, like Columbus' sailors, we feel we are about to drop off the edge,
it is hard to ignore the possibility that soon there could be no
civilisation into which Glosa  might be introduced.  Sadly, I cannot turn
my back on the world, and say I'm doing my bit by perfecting Glosa for a
time when the world is ready for it.  If the right actions are not taken
now, the world might drop back into a New Dark Age, and never be ready
for Glosa.  I don't really know when I'll be back into full promotional
mode: it depends on the international situation.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

Those are simply ambiguous or awkward sentences.
There's no way to prevent "language abuse";
that's just part of learning.

Glosa has no inflectional grammar, which is the nastiest kind.

Oh it is; they say that some language grammars rely more on morphology,
others on syntax. They'll never convict you; go ahead and use the phrase.

Not only that, but recently the linguists on sci.lang have admitted
that some languages are really truly 2 to 6 times easier than others.

> people with a better understanding of syntax would write better Glosa than those who do not have this understanding, then ... the "Rules of Syntax" will need to be 'taught' to school-children learning Glosa!

I think the best way is by example, after all. But not just easy
trivial ones. The longer sentences demonstrate more and better.
(However ... I still say Glosa's semicolons suck very badly!)

> Am I unkind, or simply technically correct, in describing English as having a "bastard grammar"?

I don't know, but most of Europe switched from SOV or VSO to basic SVO
since the year 1000 give or take a few centuries. The funny thing
about English is adjective-noun order instead of the reverse.
But it works, so Glosa hasn't chosen badly; especially since
compounds naturally follow the Greek order (e.g. "tele-phone").

> Were we living in "Peace-time"

I think we were, and that golden age (1992-2000) is past.
It's time to get working on the most important tasks.
I think that would be the development of machine intelligence;
language is a huge part of that problem. Maybe you should
reconsider whether Glosa might be part of your solution,
since it needs only a few people's help, but they are of
a very rare type, whereas political demonstrations are
mindless mass-mob things. Just my opinion, of course.

Subject: [glosalist] heresy corner --------    -     .spg ipa, syntax and cabbage flies
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com

Written in .spg (g for glosa...), a heretical variant of glosa brutally 
simplified or being so done to make the variant easy for a beginner.

there are no caps, "q" of normali glosa becomes "ku", "x" becomes "ks" and 
"sc" becomes "x" - a little confusing for us old lags but easier for 
newcomers. 

verb phrases are introduced by "pa", "fu" and "du" (present tense) - noun 
phrases  by "u", "plu" or a number - the subject may be introduced by "per" 
and the object by "em"

Henry Doubleday Research Association is shortened to HDRA and, in, .spg, to 
.hdra - at the end is some info for Robin who might find HDRA interesting and 
thinking along similar lines to his own.

The pronunciation of .spg follows the that of .ita (international phonetic 
alphabet). the word stress is on the vowel just before the last consonant, 
any vowels in words of less than 4 letters are given their full value, 
otherwise the final vowel is free to be changed, smudged or glossed over etc 
but it is recomended that it heard.
 where the vowel at the end of a word is difficult to pronounce easily before 
the vowel at the beginning of some of the following words, a very brief flap 
of "r" can be inserted. instead of "u"/"un", "a"/"ad" etc we have "u (r) 
unda", "plu (r) unda", "a (r) unda" The .spg dictionary has been adjusted a 
little to allow for these recomendationa. 
The dictionary has been assembled by amalgamating G1000, and G6000 with 
Marcel and company's pretty comprehensive core dic. for beginners it is being 
rather ruthlessly  pruned.

-------------------------------------------------
The HDRA does search for the good methods of gardening and does ask its 
members to make investigations on various themes 
==============================================

to shorten the dictionaries, we use "ne " and "no" so "approximate" becomes 
"opposite"+"exact" = ne-eksakti, "ago"  "opp." + "to come" = "ne-avante"
we can have a scale from fo-boni, meso-boni, boni, pusi-boni, no-boni, 
pusi-ne-boni, ne-boni, meso-ne-boni, fo-ne-boni
very good,moderately good, good, slightly good, indifferent, slightly 
opposite to good=bad, etc

---------------------------------------

----------------------------------------
(not exact)=about 30 or 40 years (not in front)=ago a method was sought to 
(opposite of start)=stop the bad from cabbage root fly ( a 2 wing insect that 
attack the roots of the eat-plant, cabbage) not with= without need not 
collect=spread poison on plants and soil
======================================
here we have passive mood - (they) sought a method = a method was sought. the 
active mood object noun is brought to the front and the verb adjusted. glosa 
has a similar construction (ge-cerki) that has been criticised rather. The 
use of "em" obviated the need for it 

  **************************************
more heresies to follow

dear robin
you might be interested in HDRA (www.hdra.org.uk), I've been in it for many 
years as an organic gardener. They investigate environment friendly plant 
growing in England and other parts of the world (glosa could be useful to 
them perhaps), there are or were australian members. I had a letter from an 
australian member called Pidd asking whether I was a relation. At that time 
from what I could gather, I was not. They came fromm Fleet and later I 
learned that my forefathers also came from there.

I like caps, but only for proper names and acronymns,
not for beginning sentences. But then sentences must be
separated by something more substantial than period-space.
Also I want something to show intonation, but I suppose
that's too difficult to systematize well.

Why not break up all consonant clusters, force all words
to 4 letters and have a pure CVCV root pattern? Once we decide
to phoneticize, there is no longer much recognize-ability
for eurolang speakers anyway, but it's easier for the world.

Yes, make a full set of 10 or so prepositions, maybe 10 determiners,
auxiliaries, etc. Then set up a simple word menu to pick options
to build sample sentences. Looks good in HTML forms.

That's good if we can't restructure the whole vocab to eliminate
the problem by design. But there are projects that deliberately
designed all words to differ by more than the unstressed vowel.
But even better is the idea of repeating the previous vowel,
e.g. "fele, kana, musu".

Of course, making such radical changes really makes a new language.
I have a feeling this isn't going to happen.

I prefer to eliminate roots beginning with vowels altogether.
If there were only 20 consonants and 5 vowels, that allows for
2000 CVCV roots. Adding 5 more consonants via digraphs
e.g. CH SH TH ND ST or some such, gives 3125. Adding a vowel
gives 2400. Both, 3750. Why shouldn't 2000 roots be enough?
Tunu (my linguist friend's conlang) needs only 1400.

I agree, polarity affixes or roots are very good; you multiply
effective vocabulary at minimal cost. But there are other affixes
equally productive and necessary, e.g. English -ing -ed -ly -ish.
But how to apply these affixes, at the beginning or end?
Maybe it's best to use actual roots and simply compound them.
Then, "non-" becomes "nulu", and "un-" becomes "nege", etc.
And BTW, please give me a word for "e.g."!

We could have true verbal voices such as passive and middle,
which are very productive. The verb phrase goes:
tense + aspect + mood + voice + mainverb. Most IALs fail
to distinguish tense from aspect (finished vs. continuing),
which is absolutely fatal in Asian countries.

Excellent beginning!

vowel and remains so.
ple-de-ne-kali ....... pledenekali ...... full of ugly
kali=beauty, ne-kali=ugliness

kali-ple ...... kaliple .... stress moves  to "i" the final and unimportant 
vowel.

xxxable
.spg uses "em" to mark object - if object first, "em plu(r) avi du dona per

shortened to "ge"
poti ge moti ...... (able get moved) pote-ge-moti ..... potegemoti =moveable  
 

in 2 (or more) minds about that final vowel.

recommend 1 simplish rule - all FVs are free etc and the dictionary reflects 
that idea - if the current FV is essential, add another perhaps echoing the 
stressed one
