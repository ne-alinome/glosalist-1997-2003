For easy automatic relexing, short of true translation,
from English and many other significant languages,
we need to specify good equivalents for the English
numberless indefinite article "the", and for the so-called
demonstrative adjectives "this/that/these/those" --

Glosa lists U-CI U-LA PLU-CI PLU-LA for demonstratives,
and uses U or UN and PLU as *definite* articles.
It seems to me that U/UN/PLU make excellent *indefinite*
articles, while LA/CI better serve for the definite.

Consistently using UN instead of the unlovely U and
freeing the order of particles, it could be like:

UN FELI = a cat
PLU FELI = some cats

CI FELI = LA FELI = the cat(s)

CI UN FELI = UN CI FELI = this cat
LA UN FELI = UN LA FELI = that cat

CI PLU FELI = PLU CI FELI = these cats
LA PLU FELI = PLU LA FELI = those cats

Maybe CI FELI vs. LA FELI could express some nuance.
I don't know. It's just an idea.

I agree that U/UN/PLU seem more indefinite than definite.

But UN, to me, is too close to UNO and "one". Perhaps we could drop U/UN 
altogether in favor of MO?

MO FELI = a/one cat
PLU FELI = some cats

> CI FELI = LA FELI = the cat(s)

Literally, "here cat", "there cat" (...everywhere a cat cat :-)

I have thought about replacing U-CI with CI, but it just seemed like "here" was 
an important enough concept not to muddle up with "this", let alone "the".

I like the intent, and would *love* to get rid of U-CI and U-LA, but to me CI 
and LA can't serve as the or this by themselves. Any other ideas?

Kevin

My real intent was to get "LA = the" as in other euro-style IALs.
If that link were broken as in Loglan/Lojban, it would be easy to
define reasonable apriori particles. Then MO would be much better
than U/UN, which is indeed the same as "one" and English "a/an".
But as I understand it, the authors wanted Glosa to serve as an
introduction to Mega-Glosa, which imports all international words
much as the other euro-IALs do.

The same word could be used for "one" and "a", or "there" and "the",
provided the syntax supports it. All pidgins use phrases like
"one black cat finish eat there mouse", because that's the basis
for all language anyway ... But it does sound rather bizarre and
might not attract the sort of upscale market desired.

One good feature of Glosa is the ability to add or elide particles,
so it is not necessary but remains possible to specify tense, number,
and other such notions. Logically there ought to be an orthogonal
set including at least { singular, plural, definite, indefinite,
near, far, masculine, feminine, animate, inanimate }. These could
be freely applied at the start of any noun phrase (but after the
optional preposition). By eliding the remainder of the noun phrase,
we obtain "pronouns". So a mo' careful design is essential ...
Maybe we should collect and study Shaq talk.

noun-phrase := (preposition) (articles) (adjectives) (noun)
preposition := ad | de | etc.
article     := un | la | mi | etc.
adjective   := melano | blanco | etc.
noun        := feli | etc.

Cool! They play fine with linux's mpg123 program.

It sounded like Wendy Ashby studied Italian, and Ron Clark
knew some German. And probably Robin's microphone was underwater.
Maybe all British-speakers front their vowels like Swedes,
I never noticed that before; the O and U should be stronger.
(My own accent tends to merge most of the consonants,
politely allowing the listener to project his own meanings,
but at least the vowels are clear and true, sometimes.)

Now, why not generate sound directly from the writing,
a soundex-type program (like the ancient Atari-800 used,
to pronounce English text most amusingly)? There must be
something out there on the net. Simulate nubile females
or Darth Vaders speaking whatever ...

Well, success at last. I found that same Irish-accented
mechanical voice and it is reciting from an endless loop
piped from the unix "fortune" program. I heard this one
and thought of our noble list owner, but unfortunately
it is as yet untranslated into Glosa ...

:         Barlow was a crossing-tender at a junction where an express train
: demolished an automobile and its occupants. Being the chief witness, his
: testimony was vitally important. Barlow explained that the night was dark,
: and he waved his lantern frantically, but the driver of the car paid
: no attention to the signal.
:         The railroad company won the case, and the president of the company
: complimented the old-timer for his story. "You did wonderfully," he said,
: "I was afraid you would waver under testimony."
:         "No sir," exclaimed the senior, "but I sure was afraid that durned
: lawyer was gonna ask me if my lantern was lit."

Of course it required a 27mb download of something called
"Festival". Software bloat since the good old Atari days ...
Now I have to figure out the API. One should be able to dump
fuhnetic Glosa text directly down its throat sans dictionary.
It will soon be the world's most fluent speaker, inshallah.

As far as I know, the word "hymn" can't be used in last phrase. Only religions may have hymns, while states have anthems. But R gimn
and G die hymne make anthem not-international word.

My super-non-authoritative database of true international words
has only "hymn = eng hymn, fre hymne, glo himna, ido himn, spa himno"
for this approximate concept, i.e. a special theme song. In other words,
3 major source languages (French Spanish English) and at least
2 well-known IALs (Ido Glosa) have selected this root.

Stretching HIMNA to cover both meanings is exactly what an IAL
would need to do, in order to cover the entire semantic space
with a reasonably small number of words. The only thing that
bothers me about it, is that H goes silent in most languages.

Controll langs - German and Russian use it too.
I just said that we can't say "Glosa's hymn", because this word is not used in this meaning in literary English (all the dics say
so)! While R and G use it completely for both meanings!

Replace it by "G" - this the way used in Russian...

So in http://www.glosa.org/en/audi.htm should I change "Glosa hymn" to
"Glosa anthem"?

(I think, in the German file http://www.glosa.org/dt/audi.htm
"Glosa-Hymne" and in Glosa http://www.glosa.org/gl/audi.htm
"Glosa-himno" are okay.)

Not a lot of life in this group since Wendy reasserted
control over Glosa. Where there's hope, there's talk.

It was Otto Jesperson, the most famous linguist of his time,
who invented the International Phonetic Alphabet. Later,
he participated in the 1907 committee to reform Esperanto
which produced Ido. He served as its president for some years
until it became clear that Occidental was scooping up all of
Ido's followers in the 1920's. Then he tried to ameliorate
Occ's flaws with his own Novial, which eventually merged
back into it just before WW II (after which they both
devolved into Gode's Interlingua, another story ...).

Anyway, Jesperson left us a wonderful book which is
fortunately available for free on the web. And in it
he openly discusses many of the design choices faced by
any aspiring IAL creator/reformer. In particular I'm
now interested in his remarks on the letter Z at:

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Forum/5037/AILz.html

In my own expriments in algorithmifying the selection
of international words from free online sources, I had to
deal with this troublesome letter (like J did) replacing
it with either S or C depending on its environment:

$word =~ s/([aeiou])z([aeiou])/${1}s${2}/g;
$word =~ s/z([aou])/s${1}/g;
$word =~ s/z/c/g;

I'm convinced that it needs to be removed from any viable IAL
because it is too confusing for the potential target audience.

Date: Mon, 17 Jun 2002 09:08:50 EDT

Please pardon my not writing in Glosa, but I am not yet a Glosa-pe, and I am 
trying to gather information.

At the University of Richmond in the United States we have Bachelor's and 
Graduate degree programs in disaster science and emergency management.  As 
part of those programs we publish a free electronic journal that we wish to 
make available to an international audience.  We are considering auxiliary 
languages as one way of doing so, and plan to use Internacia Lingvo 
(Esperanto) in that effort because of the number of speakers and readers.  In 
examining the other auxiliary languages, Glosa appears to have the next most 
vibrant community.  

Can the list give me an idea of how many people use Glosa today, in how many 
countries, whether there is any scientific literature in Glosa, and whether 
the Glosa community would be receptive to such an effort?

Thank you for your help.

I trust you realize that this is an idiom, and shouldn't really be translated

No problem. Welcome to our community.

I had expected someone like Robin or Marcel to respond already, but I'll provide 
my own opinions in the meantime.

That sounds great, and your choice of Esperanto makes perfect sense as your 
first IAL, given its relatively massive base of speakers.

That's exciting to hear. I don't understand why more IAL's don't have mailing 
lists, because it is very difficult for a language to thrive without one.

Unfortunately, I suspect the head count of Glosa speakers is still quite small. 
It seems to be most popular in the USA, Europe, Australasia, and Russia, and I 
understand there are a number of African Glosa speakers who do not have internet 
access. I am not aware of any significant bodies of scientific literature in 
Glosa.

> and whether the Glosa community would be receptive to such an effort?

I would imagine that the Glosa community as a whole would be very receptive and 
cooperative.

PS - please pardon any gross grammatical errors above - I am learning

Glosa vocabulary - academic ranks being one of them.  "Auxi sko-pe" was as 
close as I could come to Assistant Professor, but could be translated 
Assistant Instructor (almost not a rank) or Assistant Pupil - and that would 
drive the professorial ranks crazy.

Not all words in a vocabulary can be listed, without running over
100,000 entries in the dictionary. Only the basic words are listed.
The rules for selection of "Mega-Glosa" words state that all of
the "international" words are included in Glosa. A quick check
turns up the following:

eng assist, fre assistez, ita assistere, por assistir, spa asistir
eng professor, fre professeur, ita professore, por professor

So, you would be justified in using "asisti profeso" or thereabouts.
Terminal vowels are euphonic but non-significant (unlike Esperanto).

Subject: [glosalist] international vocabulary
From: Charles{at}Catty{dot}Com
Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2002 12:00:40 -0700

Mega-Glosa includes all the international vocabulary,
but doesn't provide a list of those words. I'm trying
to find them, and not by digging through 50-year-old
retreads of the Thorndike list ... Here are some of
the results so far, a table of counts of roots/stems
that are common across the 11 selected languages --
I included French Italian Spanish Portuguese and 6 IALs.
English is used as the pivot language, because it's easy
(the true reason for so many debateable design decisions).


         total    GOOD    fair    poor
ALL      10258    2388    3182    4688
ila       6920    2184    2284    2429
spa       4547    1825    1612    1080
fre       3680    1783    1197     678

por       3155    1598     809     700

occ       1431     838     365     201
lfn       1348     820     332     196
lfr        877     438     225     213


I have found a total of 10258 word-stems that resemble
the synsets of WordNet, mentioned previously. Of those,
2388 were found in 5 or more of the source languages
(and marked as "good" above), 4688 only in 2 langs
(and therefore not very international). Sample:


10  eng family, fre famille, glo famili, ido famili, ila familia,
    lfn familia, lfr familia, occ familie, por família, spa familia

4   eng famine, fre famine, glo famina, ido famin

7   eng famous, ila famose, ita famoso, lfn famos, occ famos, por famoso, spa famoso


Glosa with its reviled GED words did very well, Ido with
its smaller word list was quite similar. The two LF sources
and Occ's are quite small and did very poorly. Ila hit 67%
of all possible matches, though it also has the largest
number of bad matches (obsolete medical terms etc.)

Increasing the quality of the source lists would certainly
improve the output, but it looks like there are only around
7,000 true international root-stems, the rest being variants.

If anyone wishes to assist with data entry or correction,
it would be appreciated ... However, I cannot expand the list
of source langs to include Germanic or Slavic. The sources
for FISP are at wordgumbo.com, and are not extremely good,
but I developed heuristic filters to avoid false positives.

* This sounds like ~himna~ would become ~gymna~.
  However, I agree that the very religious symbol of a "hymn" may not be
suitable for something as all-encompassing as a Global Auxilliary Language.
 So, I looked up "ode" in the Latin dictionary, and found that:-
        ode(Eng)  =  carmen(Lat)
My guess is that using such a 'neutral' concept as thi would not detract
from the status of Glosa, but would avoid any pseudo-religiosity in
relation to a possible global medium of communication.
  I know that Esperanto has a 'Hymn,' but this is no reason for us - one
century later - to make the same mistake.

  While ~karmen~ is not in the Glosa lexicon, it quite well could be.

Robin Gaskell

   For my part - trying to get pictures, spoken word and text together - I
have been advised that "Flash" best creates Java-Script code capable of
playing on most operating systems, and using the widest range of auxilliary
software.  I am chasing Flash up, but need to use compressed MP3, not .WAV
files for sound.

   In a week, or two, the pressure will be off me, and I can relax with
Glosa .. as I wish to.

*  I have tried Dragon Dictate (Australian Version) and it worked very
well, but this costs about $A350, and doesn't allow a general 'Listen Only'
mode.  Needless to say, I was talking in English (possibly Australian); my
guess is that, for Glosa, a Dragon Dictate for Italian speakers would be
better than the English language version.

   In the ancient days of DOS 3, I did try a program that converted typing
into sound, but to get many of the Glosa vowel sounds, I had to spell the
words very funnily.

  Possibly there is a Public Domain, Italianate type-to-sound program out
there; in theory, Glosa has been designed to have only one pronunciation
for each letter, so the production of a _Glosa Pronunciation_ program
should not be all that difficult.  However, it sounds as if
English-speakers have lost the plot on truly international pronunciation of
vowels; so, such development work should be done by Europeans - preferably
not Swedes.

*Hello Alain,
   Welcome  OR  Bene-veni.

   To get started in Glosa, you will probably need to acquire a wordlist,
and these are available on the Net.  The alternative is to buy  a copy of
_Glosa 6000_ through Wendy Asby, one of the authorswof Glosa:-
  Wendy Ashby 
  Glosa Education Organisation
  PO Box 18
  Richmond
  Surry TW9 2GE
  England

   Oh, yes; Please subscribe yourself to the Glosalist Mailing List if you
have not already done so - send a blank email:-

  To subscribe, e-mail: glosalist-subscribe{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

  One place to start is the Glosa section of my website:-
     http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell

  The language is in full working order, and there are numerous wordlists
available on various websites.  Owing to some haste at the beginning, some
variations of spelling do exist.  These have mostly been sorted out through
the GID (Glosa Internet Dictionary) Project.

  I did locate table of Glosa grammar on my website, but the most direct
place to start with understanding the Syntax-based Grammar is probably with
Seminars #1 & #2.
  Ron Clark, the prime author of Glosa, now deceased, did not want to write
a Glosa Grammar book, but prefered people to pick up the pattern by
observation - reading the periodical Plu Glosa Verba.  The primary rule is
that one word affects the next ... and so on.  The phrase is the basic unit
of Glosa, and these phrases are either Verb Phrases or Noun Phrases, with
the major word last in the phrase: this is described Linguistically as
'Head Final' structure.  The second major feature of Glosa is that a word
does not change morphologically for reasons of grammar. As in English,
where we have "to run" and "a run," similarly, in Glosa, the phrase
structure and surrounding words clarify gramatical function: the words are
not inflected.  As Ron Clark used to say, In Glosa a word can function,
within reason, as any part of speech.

  The Phrase and Clause structure is basically similar to that of good
English, and so, punctuation within sentences acts as 'signposts' to
indicate the start of new phrases and clauses - where an absence of such
marks might cause ambiguity.  I forgot to mention: we use
Subject-Verb-Object structure within sentences.
  There are two classes of words, the smaller group of 'function words'
(conjunctions, preposition, and determinants - in English), and the vast
body of words for things and action, called 'substantives' in Glosa.
  If you are interested in the possibility of using Glosa as an auxilliary
language, I would suggst that you start soon to put words togeter to form
simple sentences: say them out aloud, and consider whether they have a
pleasant sound, and whether you can recall your originally intended meaning
as you hear yourself speak your sentence.
A sentence that fails the hearing/sense test should probably be recast ..
until it feels right.  And finally, the quickest way to developing fluency
in Glosa is to reach the stage where you can 'think in Glosa' - at first,
in small sentences, of course.

  I trust that you find the language worthwhile.  One place to start would
be to 'retell' well-known French children's stories in Glosa.  I say
'retell,' rather than 'translate,' because, at the beginning you will be
restricted by a limited vocabulary, and might have to change the story
slightly to fit in with the Glosa vocabulary you know.

  We look forward to seeing you on the List.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

No, that would be most non-standard and uninclusive.
Pure HTML (without javascript) and MPEG files are the way.
And the place for them is the web, never email lists ...

> If I knew what ^fronting my vowels^ meant, I might try to ^back^ them a bit.

The back vowels are the "U" and "O" sounds, so important in X-rated MPEGs.
They need to be pronounced with the lips rounded. British and even
Americans tend to disgrace these vowels, but the Scots avoided the
Great Sound Shift and so are more intelligible to continentals.
The sound of "A" is not so troublesome because it's understandable
whether fronted or not -- except when slurred into a schwa.
The only real antidote to English vowels is to live with Spanish
speakers several years, at least in my case. I gratuitously mention,
the RP posh "EU" diphthong is a sickening travesty of a solid "O".

> English-speakers have lost the plot on truly international pronunciation of

I prefer Latin Americans, more musical and always rhotic.
But the letter "H" is a hopeless lost cause, always silent.

Hello Robin

I am happy to get in touch again with Glosa. I've got all issues of PGN and
all the books of Ron and Wendy. A year before Ron died, he said he was going
to work at a grammar for Glosa, but perhaps he changed his mind, or the dead
did not allow him to do that.

I like very much Glosa, but am not fully happy with some little things.
First of all, the important role of context to clarify the sense of words
introduces, in my opinion, some ambiguity. Secondly, there is some lack of
accuracy in the spelling of words, that changes according with issues of PGN
(I noticed the GID project). Thirdly, it seems to be no rule to decide if a
word coming from Latin will end with A or O or I (to be true, Ron wrote
about it in an old PGN, but some blur remains).

I've given those problems a great deal of thought, and it seems to me that
just some little changes to Glosa would fix it. I'd like to talk about it
with Wendy, but she presently has no e-mail address. If you like, I'll tell
you those ideas, but I've no intention to dictate anything.

Regards, Alain

~dina~, for me, means force in a more abstract
sense.
How about ~buta grega~?

tactical: there is a Glosa word ~taktiki~ which
means tactics.
Im not really sure what a tactical unit is, maybe
its a mobile group ~kine grega~?
composed of would be ~ge-komposi ex~.
~dura~ : maybe this can be elided.
~tipo~ is typing/printing.

There is a Glosa word ~strategi~ defined in GID as a
trick!
So, I guess, also a plan of action. Maybe just
~skema~.

~stato~ and ~natio~: I think these are synonyms.
federal unit = ~federa mero~

~libela~ : I think this is level in the sense of

Hope this helps. Im sure others will want to comment.

I am happy to see a new critic has arrived. Through such
efforts Glosa may someday evolve into a great IAL. But I
think there is sufficient meta-grammar already in Glosa
to answer these questions: One simply adds more words
until the meaning is unambiguous. It is a huge advantage
of Glosa over Ido and Novial that over-fussy distinctions
are optional, never mandatory, e.g.,

kaval medik = horse doctor = doctor to/for horses
kaval milit = horse soldier = soldier with/on horse

In some weird situation a "horse doctor" might mean
"the doctor with a horse" but that isn't fatal, or
even a defect in the language -- we can simply say
"medik kon kaval" or whatever to get precise enough.
(I drop useless terminal vowels and ugly -PE suffixes,
because those are some of _my_ reform issues, but
at least I changed Cs into Ks, this time.)

As long as some kind of verbal phrase introductory particle
is always used, and similarly for the accusative/object,
and if relative clauses and punctuation are corrected,
Glosa's grammar is just fine! I'd change out most of the
particles though, like FU -> VA, PA -> FE, ...

For RANDOM, Central Glosa proposes ELEKTI ALI-RA. I am not either happy with
it and suggest ALEA or ALEO (I think words in O are better, when possible).

Subject: [glosalist] A Contrarian View on Grammar
From: N0PSB{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 27 Jun 2002 09:40:22 EDT

I am a new Glossa user.  I am also not a gramatika-pe.  Based on my 
experience with Internacia Lingvo (Esperanto) and my review of at least a 
dozen other constructed languages, I think Glosa looses its distinctiveness 
and value in direct proportion to any increase in the size and complexity of 
its grammar.  Most of these efforts, except probably Unish, seem to focus on 
just how complicated a set of grammar rules they can construct to make 
language simpler.  Esperanto sells itself on how simple it is - my Esperanto 
introductory grammar book has 214 pages of grammar in it.

For someone who has not thought about grammar in 30 plus years the eight page 
(on my printer) Syntax-Based Grammar of Glosa was a challenge to get through. 
 I do not think I have mastered all of it yet - and I had to buy a grammar 
book just to understand what I was trying to understand.  If Glosa moves from 
that level of complexity to something approaching that of Esperanto, I have 
to ask, why not just give it up and learn Esperanto?

>From my perspective as a new user the distinctiveness of Glosa is (1) simple 
grammar that relies on word position to tell the story and (2) a simple, 
limited vocabulary.  These are also its great strengths as an auxiliary 
language - simple rules, plus not a thick dictionary to memorize (I am now 
approaching a foot long section of Esperanto dictionaries in my reference 
book case).

I have been working on translating a short technical paper on emergency 
response plans into Glosa - hence my proposed definitions posted on the 
listserv.  What is very obvious to me, again as a new user, is that the 
dictionary needs work, and a lot of it, to define clearly what the real 
English equivalents (and French and German and ...) are for given words. 

For example, I suggested polisi-akti-seri as an equivalent to the English 
word strategy (and, yes, I know it is bad Glosa to hyphenate three words 
together, but why?).  The GID has a Glosa word "strategi," which Nick 
suggested, along with some quite useful refinements of the definition - the 
GID defines this as "trick."  Those of us who work in the strategic 
environment identify strategy as the operationalization of policy into a 
course of action to achieve top level goals.  What is strategy and strategi 
to be - a policy level activity that guides the affairs of nations and 
organizations, or a simple trick to fool someone?  Or is it to be both, based 
on context?  Or do we go back to the root word context of strategy?

I think the real area of ambiguity in Glosa is the 1000/6000/GID.  This is 
not a criticism of any of these - they are tremendous efforts, especially the 
GID, and the authors deserve all of the credit in the world.  But if I, or 
any other author, am to write technical or scientific material, I need a 
better product to work from.  

The other comment I have is that Glosa's simple rules have had an interesting 
impact on how I think about my writing.  I find myself thinking more about 
what is important in what I am saying and a lot more about the relationship 
of words.

So my vote is do not fool with the grammar until we know what the words mean. 
 I am sure that the users of the list already understand the full meaning of 
the words, but until they are also obvious to new users I am not sure you 
will have achieved a solid foundation for growth.

In my opinion, Grammar is just a name for the set of rules for a language.
So, using the word "grammar" does not imply that this grammar is huge and
abstruse (a good Glosa grammar could comprise just about ten pages). But the
main goal is, as for words, there is no ambiguity. A good balance should be
found between simplicity and speed (but ambiguity) and accuracy (but
complexity).

> I am a new Glossa user.  I am also not a gramatika-pe.

I've been into Glosa and Interglossa since 1970.
Interlinguistics (study and design of bridge languages)
led me to study "real" linguistics. What is commonly
called "grammar" of the type taught in lower schools
(verbs, indirect objects, ad nauseum) is now at least
100 years obsolete. That is the sort of thing we can
do without in Glosa. But we can't contravene the
linguistic realities ...

> I think Glosa looses its distinctiveness and value

> and complexity of its grammar.

Agreed. The designers/authors aimed Glosa at people
who basically hate "grammar", and this is correct
"strategy" for a bridge language, which will always
be a second language, learned and used by adults
for practical purposes. The model should be Swahili
(simplified Bantu with Arabic loanwords) or the
Lingua Franca (ultra-simplified Romance). All such
languages share many features, and not following
"grammarians" is one of those features ...

> Syntax-Based Grammar of Glosa was a challenge to get through.

Glosa's grammar is just a simplified mixture of English and
whatever Romance language one has studied in high school.
All inflections are eliminated, and word order within a phrase
is like English, modifiers preceding the words they modify.
There are around 50 special words called particles which do
whatever additional magic stuff which may be necessary.

> I had to buy a grammar book just to understand what I was
> trying to understand.

Just do a web search for "pidgins and creoles and Bickerton".

> why not just give it up and learn Esperanto?

I like all the artificial languages, but only a pidgin-like
analytic-grammar type such as Glosa or Lingua Franca can be
learned easily enough by the vast majority of working adults.
Others are nice toys or hobbies or secret-codes or cult langs.
However: Glosa leaves you with the problem of how to create
long compound words to simulate the huge vocabulary of concepts
an adult would need to use in the real world; this is the
problem of "derivation". The solution is to realize that
1000 basic roots get us nowhere. We need to import many more
from the already-existing "international vocabulary".
This was called "Mega-Glosa" by the authors.

> simple rules, plus not a thick dictionary to memorize

The trick is to use only those words that are already present
in the source (lexifier) languages. That is the Norman and
Latinate portion of English, as opposed to the Anglo-Saxon.
There's the winning "strategy" (French stratégie, Spanish
estrategia, Italian strategìa, etc). You know most of them
at-sight without any study, and once comfortable with the
system, you can guess most of the remainder. No pain.

I'm a programmer. I've written software to input public domain
bilingual word lists and cross-correlate them to find cognate words
with similar meaning. It generates approx 10,000 entries like this,
among which one can find the international words:

> I know it is bad Glosa to hyphenate three words together, but why?

It's only bad if there is no shorter equivalent. Works fine in German ...

> a policy level activity that guides the affairs of nations and
> organizations, or a simple trick to fool someone?

The bad news is that all languages must work in exactly that way.
You have reified (and refined) the lowly word into a high concept,
but the word remains as it was, a mere culturally-founded artifact.
Above, the stated goal was minimization of vocabulary, but just in
computer jargon I could use up 10,000 specifically essential words,
so we're going to be hyphenating an awful lot, or else using more
general senses. Precision is impossible in the base vocabulary,
lower-frequency specific senses are implemented as compounds.

> I am sure that the users of the list already understand

Not so!

We seem to be lacking a word for 'pattern', and I don't mean 'pattern' as in a

and would like to coin a G word "fortuitu" - I don't know whether the powers 
that be would allow it

it is not "bad" glosa, the word "bad" is pretty meaningless here. it is 
decidedly unusual but understandable. on the other hand we must all come to 
some agreement about how to express ourselves in G otherwise our 
wtitings/speech would be misunderstood. I could work out yours but needed 
some head scratching -  Glosa could learn one or two things from you  too 
........... keep at it with the help of dictionaries etc you will be able to 
adapt your style to a more orthodox one - not that I.m all that orthodox or

what glosalist needs is lots and lots of glosa, "good", "bad", orthodox or

Many IALs have attempted to accommodate speakers pronouncing
"kw" as "kv". I think it would be much better to simplify,
and use only "ku". But then, as in Novial, the dictionary
gets eye-glazingly thick in the K section ...

But it is possible and desireable to eliminate spelling
difficulties, recognizing that each native speaker group has
different problems. By accepting the hard/soft C/G rule,
quasi-instinctive (by childhood training) to almost every
person in Europe/Americas/Australia, it is possible to
eliminate H J K Q W X Y Z, like a more-regularized Spanish.

It would gain immensely in both recognition and production.
Mangling the international vocabulary by strange spellings
(Esperanto, Ido, Novial, Glosa) is worse than semi-apriori
(Loglan/Lojban) because it's actually anti-mnemonic. Using
more natural spelling facilitates learning, for everyone.

And then Glosa could be marketed worldwide as a first step to
otherwise impossibly difficult (western) European languages.

Ido tries to be "logical" but it is impossible to use.
Always remember that an IAL is a second language for adults,
and if it is too difficult they can't learn it. We must
accommodate a range of pronunciations in the real world,
not excluding people because of insignificant differences.

> (what's "ing" in glosa?)

English "-ing" is similar to Glosa "du-".

> the european language lands.

We must use what is natural to Spanish/English/French,
the vast majority of all potential Glosa speakers.
It would be nice to include a wider audience, but that
is not possible. Unless you try Occidental instead.

>> Mangling the international vocabulary by strange spellings
>> (Esperanto, Ido, Novial, Glosa) is worse than semi-apriori

> It isn't! It's logic!

You can't win that argument. See the Ido vocabulary for
examples. Nobody can memorize all the artificial divergences.
So it can never be spoken or understood in real life, and
is hard enough even in writing, where you must look up
every word in a dictionary. Logically you could better use
numbers instead of words, with decimal points to mark off
the affixes.

>>  Using more natural spelling facilitates learning, for everyone.

> Well, but why not use simple Latin in that case?

Latin is not simple, and is dead. Whereas half the world today
speaks English/Spanish/French/Portuguese, and they all mix well.
So those are the best sources for vocabulary, and spelling must
be similar to Spanish. Logic! Just don't go changing random
letters to differentiate meanings, because that sort of mangling
destroys any potential ease of learning.

> But glosa isn't like those tongues. The grammar is very different.

Only superficially.

Well, really, it is "KW". 

Hogben suggested that what was important was that
every letter or digraph should always have the same
pronunciation, and that it was not necessary that
every sound should have only one spelling.

No need for -ing here :- spelling = to spell = letter.

"fortuitu" is not really any different from the
standard Glosa ~fortuna~ "chance", mid-way between
"lucky" and "unlucky" [~boni-fortuna~ and
~mali-fortuna~].

Aren't you really trying to get an unpredictable
order?
The cards would already be in a random order, unless
it was the first time they had been used.

"unpredictable" = ~ne-pre-ge-ski~

Indeed. I am just now beginning to find time again for Glo/Glosa activities, and 
am catching up on my old emails.

The first thing that strikes me about this passage is that it is not very well 
written in English. Well, I suppose if you like really complex, run-on sentences 
it is fine. But I prefer to be able to actually understand what is written, 
quickly and easily.

So my first task, I suspect, would be to rewrite it _in English_. I suspect that 
would be easier for me than trying to restructure AND translate it at the same 
time.

I haven't read Nick's Glo translation yet (the one he posted a few weeks ago). 
Here is my own. Note that this is written in Glo, not Glosa. I think that 
Glosa-pe can simply:
- Pretend each sentence starts with a capital letter
- Ignore 'ca', which begins a verb (or pretend it is 'nu')
- Ignore 'sa', which indicates posession
- Remember that 'zero' is used in place of 'ne'

I think it's a bit weak in a couple spots, due to Glo's very small (and 
unfinished) vocabulary. Still, I think it proves that 500 roots can go pretty 
far.

Now I'll go take a look at Nick's submission to see how close we ended up.
