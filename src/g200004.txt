The Wolf
- Hermann Hesse (1907)
----------------------------------------------------

Never had there been so cruelly cold and long a winter in the French
mountains. For weeks the air had been clear, crisp and cold. By day the
great slanting snowfields lay dull-white and endless under the glaring blue
sky; by night the moon passed over them, a small, clear, angry frosty moon,
and on the snow its yellowish glare turned a dull blue that seemed the very
essence of coldness. The roads and trails were deserted, especially the
higher ones, and the people sat lazy and grumbling in the village huts. At
night the windows glowed smoky red in the blue moonlight, and before long
they were dark.

It was a hard time for the animals of the region. Many of the smaller ones,
and birds as well, froze to death, and their gaunt corpses fell prey to the
hawks and wolves. But they too suffered cruelly from cold and hunger. There
were only a few wolf families in the region, and their distress led them to
band more closely together. By day they went out singly. Here and there one
of them would dart through the snow, lean, hungry, and alert, as soundless
and furtive as a ghost, his narrow shadow gliding beside him in the
whiteness. He would turn his pointed muzzle into the wind and sniff, and
from time to time let out a dry, tortured howl. But at night they would all
go out together and the villages would be surrounded by their plaintive
howling. Cattle and poultry were carefully shut up, and guns lay in
readiness behind sturdy shutters. Only seldom were the wolves able to pounce
on a dog or other small prey, and two of the pack had already been shot.

The cold went on and on. Often the wolves huddled together for warmth and
lay still and brooding, listening woefully to the dead countryside around
them, until one of them, tortured by hunger, suddenly jumped up with a
bloodcurdling roar. Then all the others turned their muzzles toward him and
trembled; and all together burst into a terrible, menacing, dismal howl.

Finally a small part of the pack decided to move. Early in the morning they
left their holes, gathered together, and sniffed anxiously and excitedly at
the frosty air. Then they started off at a quick, even trot. Those who were
staying behind looked after them with wide glassy eyes, trotted a few steps
in their wake, stopped, stood still for a moment in indecision, and went
slowly back to their empty dens.

At noon the traveling party split in two. Three of the wolves turned
eastward toward the Swiss Jura, the others continued southward. The three
were fine strong animals, but dreadfully emaciated. Their indrawn
light-colored bellies were as narrow as straps, their ribs stood out
pitifully on their chests, their mouths were dry and their eyes distended
and desperate. They went deep into the Jura. The second day they killed a
sheep, the third a dog and a foal. On all sides the infuriated country
people began to hunt them. Fear of the unaccustomed intruders spread through
the towns and villages of the region. The mail sleighs went out armed, no
one went from one village to another without a gun.

After such good pickings, the three wolves felt at once contented and
uncertain in the strange surroundings. Becoming more foolhardy than they had
ever been at home, they broke into a cow barn in broad daylight. The warm
little building was filled with the bellowing of cows, the crashing of
wooden bars, the thudding of hooves, and the hot, hungry breath of the
wolves. But this time people stepped in. A price had been set on the wolves,
and that redoubled the peasants' courage. They killed one with a gunshot
through the neck, the second with an ax. The third escaped and ran until he
fell half-dead in the snow. He was the youngest and most beautiful of the
wolves, a proud beast, strong and graceful. For a long time he lay panting.
Blood-red circles whirled before his eyes, and at times a painful, wheezing
moan escaped him. A hurled ax had struck him in the back. But he recovered
and managed to stand up. Only then did he see how far he had run. Far and
wide there were neither people nor houses. Ahead of him lay an enormous
snow-covered mountain, the Chasseral. He decided to go around it. Tortured
by thirst, he took a few bites of the frozen hard snow crust.

On the other side of the mountain he spied a village. It was getting on
toward nightfall. He waited in a dense clump of fir trees. Then he crept
cautiously past the garden fences, following the smell of warm barns. There
was no one in the street. Hungrily but fearfully, he peered between the
houses. A shot rang out. He threw his head back and was about to run when a
second shot came. He was hit. On one side his whitish belly was spotted with
blood, which fell steadily in big drops. In spite of his wound he broke into
a bounding run and managed to reach the wooded mountain. There he stopped
for a moment to listen, and heard voices and steps in the distance.
Terror-stricken, he looked up at the mountainside. It was steep, densely
wooded, and hard to climb. But he had no choice. Panting, he made his way up
the steep wall, while below him a confusion of curses, commands, and lantern
lights skirted the mountain. Trembling, the wounded wolf climbed through the
woods in the half-light, while slowly the brown blood trickled down his
flank.

The cold had let up. The sky in the west was hazy, giving promise of snow.

At last the exhausted beast reached the top. He was at the edge of a large,
slightly inclined snowfield not far from Mont Crosin, high above the village
from which he had escaped. He felt no hunger, but a dull persistent pain
from his wound. A low sick bark came from his drooping jaws, his heart beat
heavily and painfully; the hand of death weighed on it like a heavy load. A
lone fir tree with spreading branches lured him; there he sat down and
stared forlornly into the snow-gray night. Half an hour passed. Then a red,
strangely muted light fell on the snow. With a groan the wolf stood up and
turned his beautiful head toward the light. It was the moon, which, gigantic
and blood-red, had risen in the southeast and was slowly climbing higher in
the misty sky. For many weeks it had not been so big and red. Sadly, the
dying wolf's eyes clung to the hazy disk, and again a faint howl rattled
painfully through the night.

Then came lights and steps. Peasants in thick coats, hunters and boys in fur
caps and clumsy leggings came tramping through the snow. A triumphant cry
went up. They had sighted the dying wolf, two shots were quickly fired. Both
missed. Then they saw that he was already dying and fell upon him with
sticks and clubs. He felt nothing more.

Having broken his bones, they dragged him down to Saint-Immer. They laughed,
they boasted, they sang, they cursed; they were looking forward to brandy
and coffee. None of them saw the beauty of the snow-covered forest, or the
radiance of the high plateau, or the red moon which hovered over the
Chasseral, and whose faint light shimmered on their rifle barrels, on the
crystalline snow, and on the blurred eyes of the dead wolf.

I can across this paragraph in a article by an advocate of a Modified
English as the IAL. I think is interesting in light of the discussions
recently about synonyms.

"Moreover, a defined lexicon may not give an adequate choice of synonyms. A
single word might be sufficient to convey meaning, and quite adequate for
many; but language is more than logic for those who wish it to be so. Any
speaker or writer who seeks to create poetic speech may require stress,
rhyme, alliteration, metre, cadence, resonance, contrast, variety or
emphasis within a single word. This is why synonyms may be preferred - even
though they all mean practically the same thing. In addition, English is
full of near-synonyms from different languages e.g. "rear/raise,
weak/frail/fragile", which not only give it subtlety, but lower the
"vocabulary barrier" for many nationalities. No other tongue, least of all
among the constructed languages, displays this degree of flexibility. It is
difficult to imagine that any constructed language could be designed with
such a feature - which means that, when people from diverse linguistic
backgrounds use English, they can employ the synonym nearest to the word in
their first language. It might not be quite right; but they will be
understood."

I think this should be thought about before all the current synonyms are
deleted from a "Core"-dictionary, as this theoretical improvement might not
impove thinks in practice.

*   This highlights the whole question of international communication.  Sometimes we have to 'drop' into another national language for clarification.

    I would like to see subsscribers to Glosalist come up with an inspired way of interleaving the odd natlang example, without upsetting the flow of the general argument.

    In this case, English is the missing natlang; I would need something solid against which to compare the Glosa, that has been translated from German.  I am not speaking here of the actual words, because, in a poem, such as _The Wolf_, what needs to be captured is the poet's implied feeling: this is hard to capture when attempting to "reverse engineer' other people's Glosa, which has arrived via German.

*   Yes, this 'aside' marked by a hyphen did the trick.

    I have found in the past that square brackets are generally acceptible for this sort of thing, EG ['skirted' in Eng. Ver.], or if only one alternative language is being mentioned, simply [skirted].

*   I would not feel that Glosa words were "sacred"; rather I understand them to be derived from current Classical roots, because they best represent a particular concept and its context.  However, I have found it most usful to refer to the Greek and Latin dictionaries, when a difficult question of word usage arises.  I have sought to intuit the surrounding contexts of the various Classical words that have been fed into Glosa.  After doing this sort of dictionary research, I am convinced of the rightness of a particular Glosa derivative for my purpose, or, oppositely, of its unsuitbility.


    When such research leads me to the conclusion that a particular concept has not been covered adequately by the Glosa authors, I look again into the Classical dictionaries, seeking a word tht would be better for my purposes than any existing Glosa word, and one which would not clash with words already in the Glosa dictionary. On such rare occasions I find it convenient to coin a new Glosa word.

    Whilst I, too, have said that a Glosa parser should be a snack to prepare, I have got a range of resposes,to this assertion, with the worst from LIU Haitao, who said, that because Glosa had no P-o-S markers and no verb inflections it was impossible to create a parser for the language.

*   I do suspect that it is a bit more complicated than this, even as Glosa stands.  Needless to say, one of my reasons for trying to prepare a descriptive grammar of Glosa was to seek out all of the loose ends, and to identify just how many discrete descriptions were needed to cover the

full implementation of the language.

An early stage of "parser processing" finds the noun and verb phrases.
Particles like "es" stand to the left of such phrases, and the fuller
semantic words like nouns and verbs stand to the right. The particles
categorize the phrase and tie it to the clause/sentence/paragraph;
"es" being as verby as anything, prepositions and determiners serving
for case (when specified - core cases usually are "licensed" by verbs).
Certain patterns like "u/plu adj ... noun" and "es ... pred.adj"
are what the student learns, without ever really understanding the
irrelevant grammatical details like "what is a noun, really?"

No, it's easy. I think it is even very fair to provocatively say that
"Glosa has very little grammar". And what little it has, is a
simplified English. This is still speaking of syntax, only.

A second stage or parsing, where Esperanto/Ido do much better than Glosa,
is morphological. I categorically deny the myth that English has little
morphology; there are according to Skeat far more etymological affixes
than he can ever hope to count. Glosa has only the -bo type, and general
hyphenation-compounding of roots. This is Glosa's 2nd major strength
from the viewpoint of a learner, because morphology is extremely difficult;
but it is also such a powerful technique that Esperanto/Ido can nearly
make a whole language out of it alone, whereas Glosa has no derivational
system at all, nor a large stock of roots ... and suffers expressively.
Anyway, sure makes parsing easy, whether one has a consistent *or*
a nearly absent morphology. English morphology is impossible to parse,
and I've had a lot of "fun" trying to do it.

Let's parse into phrases your clear and idiomatic English sentence there:

"I do suspect that ..."
There's a simple SVO with the O expanding to a relative clause.

"it is a bit ..."
There's a simple predication about to expand into a comparison.

"more complicated than this, ..."
English uses more/less/same/than/as particles as prepositions
to build a coordinated "comparison" structure thingy.

"even as Glosa stands."
OK, here's my point: No matter how you parse this piece,
its connection to the rest of the sentence has a para-syntactic nature.

This is what I consider the true essence o language, a loose coupling
of syntactically vague pieces into a semantically meaningful relation.
Listen to 2 teenage girls in a conversation, stealthily,
and notice that *they do not speak in literary sentences at all*.
Conversation is the real language, not writers' stories.

> one of my reasons for trying to prepare a descriptive grammar of Glosa

I know that, now, from reading the archives of AUXLANG; but it's useless
and impossible to dress up Glosa in a terminology to please such people.
I used to believe that Glosa really needed the POS markers and such,
but have seen that Glosa works simply and well enough with a mere
few particles as syntactic signposts.

The "loose ends" are really not loose at all, they are the honest
trapping of real language in actual use. Don't ever apologize for them,
they are what make it speakable by teenage girls, a much better
demographic target than crusty old dyspeptic grammar mavens.
The best way to kill Glosa would be to make it like Latin,
a deadly bore to the young at heart.

Well, I'll hold off on that for now. I just wanted to say that there
are some unique strengths in Glosa, and that imitating the course
of Ido/Novial/Occidental (which I greatly admire) would be both
foolish and impossible. Glosa should take a different course,
emphasizing celebrating and enhancing its pidgin-like quality.

I think the use of Greek rather than Latin as a vocabulary base
was a mistake by Glosa's designers. Probably you, as a supporter
of Gode's Interlingua, can agree with me on that point.
The portion of Greek that made it into the scientific vocabulary
is certainly useful in any auxlang, however.

> >Glosa has some problems though, in my honest opinion, and

I must admit that I do *not* see Glosa in its current state
as truly finished or usable for much of any purpose, and so
I stand by that statement of mine, though if the world or a large
number of people embrace it as-is, that would be fine with me.
I think Glosa needs a version 3, based on pidgin-creole principles.
I doubt this can ever happen, and I am as satisfied with Occidental
as you are with Interlingua.

(But I feel no need to attack Glosa or try to kill it from within
as a 5th columnist. It was amazing, to see your posts in auxlang
from the year before I joined it. Since there is still such bad blood
between us, I will be ignoring your future postings here, as elsewhere.)

Well, since you expressed interest in my polite words above ...

I would like to see the strongest possible "contender" in
a creole-type of auxlang, hoping it might catch on and if not,
that we might learn from the experience how to do better.
When I first read Lehmann's book on creoles, that area of
linguistic study was just beginning. In 20 years time,
vastly more has been learned. I have posted the URLs to
this and other lists many times, and there are plenty of
Glosa-list archives to examine here ...

A creole syntax devoid of morphology is, everyone now agrees,
the easiest to learn. Creoles also use the easiest phonology.
Syntax can be minimal and it can be spoken in a pidgin form
almost immediately in acceptable fashion. In some cases the
result can be fun and even infectious, as the Tenas Wawa pages
demonstrate for the Chinook Jargon.

Glosa's vocab needs work though. It isn't really as streamlined
or expressive as it needs to be, in order to be taken seriously
by linguists. An auxlang really does need that mark of approval
before it can be acceptable to the public.

I trust that will clarify my current position. I reserve the
right to learn more and change my opinion accordingly at any time.

    Yes, Glosa's simplicity is only syntax-deep.

    So that makes Glosa's parsing a three-step operation:-
  Syntactic - fairly standardised, and easy to automate.
  Morphological - very small, and thus easy to cope with.
  Semantic - possibly a minefield, because this is where most of Glosa's
understanding comes from.  It is also the reason most people do not know
how to approach the writing (and speaking) of Glosa, because the raw words
(and associated meanings) do all the work, causing the utterer to compose
their thoughts at the ideational level - instead of letting the morphology
sort out all of the details.

    And this is the mystery: the teenage girls do use a form of syntax that
allows them to make sense of each other's words and - even with heavy
elision, and considerable disregard for morphology - they happily sequence
their semantic elements in relation to this conditioned (or natural) syntax.

*  Wow!
  . Traditional grammar terminology does not seem to satisfy Glosa's need.
  . Interesting re P-o-S: with well-written Glosa, syntax should make word
function clear.
  . Yes, I feel the 'signposts' work, and also think they should be used,
in writing especially, when any possibility of confusion exists.

synthetic add-ons; they simply represent a description of the basic
elements required for an effective communication medium.

It's OK to be a little skeptical ... "es/is" is often called
"the copula" or "an auxiliary"; it certainly isn't just an ordinary
verb like "to throw". In the spirit of Hogben, it may be more correct
to speak of "full words" (general vocabulary) vs. "empty words"
(grammatical particles with relatively little semantic meaning).
It was rather a brave strategy in Glosa to toss out "grammar",
and ultimately I think its main strength. If too much grammatical
complexity creeps back into it, it will please only the wrong crowd.

> Yes, Glosa's simplicity is only syntax-deep.

I think it is the *essence* -- and a good thing. I've mentioned
before, elsewhere, that what seemed to work best for me
in learning to use Occidental was precisely the "analytical"
verb system. Instead of tense endings and suchlike claptrap,
one does much like Glosa. It is the only auxlang I succeeded
in actually using, and liking whole-heartedly, though I also
still admire parts of Glosa and Ido.

Glosa could, if it had a better vocabulary, and if it could
solve the problem of derivation, perhaps go even further.
Many people have suggested that an auxlang designed around
a creole structure should be the ideal auxlang. But every time
another Latin/Romance-based auxlang comes along, it drags in
all the grammatical claptrap that students universally hate ...
which is why Interlingua de Gode sucks so much.

I'd like to see a Glosa version 3.

Exactly what I meant, except I see the minefield more as elysian.
That's just the way language has to be. The other approach,
defining meaning logically, is what we do with logic and algorithms.
I am both a holder of a math degree and a programmer for 20 years,
but the day will never come when people can "speak" logic.

Syntactically, I think they did well. Phonologically,
(I mean being easy to learn to pronounce for most cultures)
they did OK too. Derivation and vocabulary selection, though ...

Yeah, I admit, you convinced me somewhere along the way. Thanks.
Then I experienced that in using Occidental ... the little vowel
POS endings are soon elided, being felt as cumbersome.

Can't please some people, no matter what you do.

Well, as an experiment, if one were to select a random
page in the Interlingua dictionary that is online at
http://www.interlingua.com ... how can Glosa truly handle
translation of the word families presented there?

(Not just find a single cognate root in Glosa to cover
many related but different concepts. Occidental can do it
with a systematic set of affixes, but that is not Glosa's way.)

*
*   I still describe them as "substantives" - used as 'nouns', 'verbs' and
'modifiers' .. having concept meaning; and "function words" - used as
conjunctions, prepositions, negatives, interrogatives, "temporals", and
simple syntax guides .. showing the inter-relations between the concept-words.

    Where the system breaks down - apart from your concern over vocabulary
derivation - is in adding the additional 'flavours' to the substantives.
While Esperanto does this well(?) with inflections, glosa tries hard with:-
  . particles - in front of words  e.g. u, pa.
  . generic terms - two-letter abbreviations of substantives added as
       hyphenated suffixes  e.g. -pe, -do.
  . a rare prefix, to achieve passivity  i.e. ge- .

  . compounding between substantives, where the resulting concept is a
       meld of component concepts  e.g. u tele-video produce-pe.

    Paul Bartlett suggested the possibility of some other formative
affixes, working similarly to the 'generics', but with possibly four
letters (still abbreviated) and also hyphenated - mainly to act as
suffixes, but also, possibly, as prefixes.  I tend to agree with him; but
there is still some rationalisation of the basic vocabulary still to be
done.  Also, this would be research on Glosa done outside the seminal
centre of Richmond, Surry, and, as such, might represent an unfortunate
contre-temps* with the authors.

  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run.
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.

The particles and lexical compounding seem true to its nature,
but to begin adding affixes again doesn't, to me ... in that case
(the "-pe" and "ge-" types) one might as well opt for Ido's artificial
or Occidental's naturalistic affixes.

The affixations mentioned above. They seem awkward and inadequate to me.
The virtue of Glosa is in its relatively lack of affixation/morphology.

Yes, sorry; I estimate only around half the vocab was well-chosen;
Ido's basic vocabulary is much better (though not "perfect" either).
If 3000 or so roots without affixes were enough for a usable language,
I could learn to like them, but clearly they are not enough, because
the authors haven't a systematic derivational scheme, so they
have to add completely different roots for each shade of meaning.

OCC does not have a good URL for comparison. Basically it uses the
same affixes as Interlingua (plus about 50% more) to extend roots.
The "Radicarium" I have only in paper form; it shows typically:
PRESS-er ... to press. affixes: -e, -ion, com-, ex-, im-, etc

If one likes that sort of naturalistic affixation, then Glosa isn't
going to be able to compete. OCC goes for "at sight recognition"
and immediate comprehensibility, at the cost of needing to know
a significant (maybe 10,000 root) Latinate vocabulary. This works
well for lazy learners like me who already speak English, since Eng
swallowed most of the Latin-Greek roots.

Glosa could be something *different*, a minimal-vocab language
for non-euro-speakers. I imagine: the current syntax, and phonology,
plus a cleaned-up list of 2500 roots, minus all affixation.
Then market it as *the* easiest language to learn for all the world.

*   While I understnd Paul Bartlett's comment concerning synonyms, that people using different synonyms could, for practical purposes, be speaking different languages, I do support the fairly early learning and use of synonyms, for the reason stated by the writer, above.


    It is my belief that a straightened language is best for beginners, but that alternative forms - possibly only one from Greek and one from Latin - should be introduced soon after the learner is fluent with a one-word/one-concept vocabulary.


    I listened to Ron Clark's argument for the Glosa 1000 lexicon - with basically one word for each of Roget's concepts - and did try to learn and use Glosa thus; it gave me the claustrophobic sensation that I was trying to communicate in a fish-bowl.  I kept going round and round bumping into the same words over and over again.

    The word for this suffocating feeling is iteraphobia (= a fear of   repetition, leading to the seeking of synonyms); Dr Johnson once said that on hearing a word go down for the third time, he felt he was drowning.


    As I have said before, the publication of the _Glosa 6000_ dictionary enabled me to enjoy writng Glosa, whereas using _Glosa 1000_ left me unsatisfied and iteraphobic.  When we strike the happy medium with a _Glosa 2500_, and I hope this is soon, then we should have a first dictionary that does not restrict the learner's ability to express common concepts.  However, after that, the learner ought to be able to upgrade to a larger dictionary that gives more literary satisfaction.


Saluta,


Robin Gaskell

   P.S.  While both the term and the historical reference introduced, above, are Gaskell originals, I believe that they did help me to make the point; moreover, I believe my 'poetic licence' permits me to add to the language in this way, as long as it is done artistically.   R.G.

On the other hand, Fowler had a certain contempt for "elegant variation".
And looking at the routine primitiveness of it in much communication, e.g.
the absolute necessity for the newspaper reporter to alternate "the U.N."
and "the world body", I'm on Fowler's side.  It seems an artificial,
self-inflicted need leading to the lowest form of art.

On the main point, which I inadvertently snipped, I have seen a Basic
English passage of considerable beauty.  The complaint made against Basic
seems to be less a sense of being bereft of words wanted for pure
variety, and more a sense of boredom at the incessant circumlocations
needed to express meanings for which single words are not available.

My impression is that limiting the required vocabulary is very important,
that noticing the importance of it was a key advance.

The problem with having ostensibly alternative words is that there are no
exact synonyms.  A particular skill in the idiom is needed to use near
synonyms correctly.  This is the reverse of what is needed for an
international language.  We just do not need complications like that.

In the Ido list recently there was a discussion of the difference between
savar and konocar.  All that was shown was that having both is a problem.
Certainly, by a thorough study of the two words one can learn to use both
correctly to express their separate fine shades of meaning, but what the
hell, a bit of arm waving and explanation would do as well.

    ~Mo latu, de an leuko-iso abdomina, pa habe plu maluka de hema; qi pa

**   I must say that it worries me that such a range of possible
translations is possible .. with Glosa.
   In the case of translating potry, however, I veer towards attempting to
maintain the rhythm, and economy of words, of the original.  The pleasant
metaphoric use of English-language prepositions, is unfortunately, I fear,
lost on Glosa, in which the use of non-literal language is to be avoided:-
   "on one side"
       is not ~epi mo latu~,
       while ~u latu~ seems to lack some specificity.
       I feel that it is not Glosa usage, and ~mo latu~ suffices.
   "in big drops"
       is neither ~intra plu mega guta~ nor ~in plu mega guta~,
       but, ~per plu mega guta~ [BY big dropS] seems apt.
   Meanwhile, from the forgoing mention of a 'continuous flow', the
'dropping of blood' is already in the plural - from context, and so, the
~plu~ seems redundant.

   On a point of grammar, however, I would suggest that Nick's rendition is
missing a word, leaving the Relative Clause [Adj. Cl.] a little incomplete:-
  ~ ... hema; qi no-muta-ratio ki kata plu mega guto.~
  [ .. blood, which steadily  fell down big drops.]

   For me, to make this clause work, I would have to make ~abdomina~ the
NOUN, which was modified; also, I would need to add an ~ex~.
  ~Plu maluka, de hema, pa marka mo latu, de an leuko-iso abdomina; ex
    [drops    of blood   marked one side of his  whitish   belly,  from

qi no-muta-ratio ki kata plu mega guto.~
which  steadily fell down  large drops]

Subject: [glosalist] LINE-WIDTH NO < 75 CHARS

Hello Friends,
  This is an administrative request.

  Please use line widths approximately 70 - 75 characters wide.

REASON:
  A message that originally fits the page at 80 characters, ends up with
"curl"
around sentences, after going through one, or two, replies.

  The
>
>> and
>> > found in often requoted messages cause lines to grow beyond the
limits
of the software.

   Perhaps some psychological complex causes me to see 'untidiness' in
messages that are a series of long and short lines.  However, the cause of
better formatting of messages is served by starting off with shorter
line-lengths, which allow a margin at the right-hand side for growth.

   My thanks go to people who already restrict their line-lengths; my
appreciation goes to those who see the beauty in well-formatted messages.

Gracia and Thanks,

Robin Gaskell


  Although things might get worse in the short run, they are going to get
much, much better, in the long run.
  It is our job to make this happen, and to do it sooner rather than later.
  R.
