Hello Friends, 
        This is a first message to sixteen subscribers, not a test.

        Which lexicon are you using for selection of Glosa words?  There are
basically two lists: Glosa 1000 and Glosa 6000.  But there are also "Glosa
Central" and "Glosa Classified" lists, with some variations between each
list - as pointed out to me recently by Paul Bartlett.

        So, for those with a copy of "Glosa 1000", your use of words will be
economical in the extreme.  This `starting vocabulary' has only one root
(Greek or Latin) for each concept, and allows you to get the feel of the
language.  Now, if you really are trying to say something complicated, this
beginners'
dictionary will hardly satisfy you.

        In "Glosa 6000" there are some synonyms (both Greek and Latin roots
for one concept), and there is a much wider choice of words to allow the
speaker/writer more freedom.  I can speak from experience that the writer
will find it boring and repetitive if the alternative root is not available.
So, for good style, the synonyms are essential.  However, in a query
language situation involving man/machine interaction, there is a strong case
for using only one root per concept.  

        For people who do not have the larger dictionary, I have a scanned
version of the "6000", and will clean it up to print and post copies to
those who request it.  A copy of the "Glosa Classified" wordlist is
available through my website: this features the core thousand words grouped
according to their linguistic function.

        To get started with using Glosa, it is a good idea to buy the "18
Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa."  I will be guided by your wishes - aiming
to give part of my time here to teaching the usage of Glosa, and the other
time to discussing the language and means of dissemination.

Saluta,
 Robin

Well, for what it isworth, I use all, though I try the '1000' first, 
since it is small.  It is amazing how much you can say with such a 
limited vocabulary, although nuances and style ae quite another matter.  
I happen to prefer the Greek choices over the Latin, but that is a 
personal matter of taste -- I think I can recognize both in most instances.

Since the list is up, best wishes to all.  Henceforward I'll try to write 
in Glosa.

Subject: Experimental Glosa Discussion Group
To: fearn{at}compuserve{dot}com; William
Date: Wed, 23 Jul 97 12:2

To recipients of this email interested in Glosa:

    On an experimental basis, I have set up an email discussion 
group for the following purposes:

1) Discussion of Glosa as an international auxiliary language;
2) Practice in using Glosa with positive feedback from others.

Please note that this is NOT a conventional mailing list as often
found on the Internet.  There is no automatic subscription,
unsubscription, archive retrieval, help files, and so on.  It is merely
a central point to which you can send an email for either or both of
the above purposes and have it distributed to other discussion group
members.

    To join this group, just send an email to the following address:

To: Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

and ask to join the group.  Note that it is important that the word
glosa   itself not appear anywhere in the above address.

    After you have joined the group, if you want to send an email to
other group members for group purposes, send an email addressed as
follows:

To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

It is critical that you note the difference in addressing.  In the
first case, the word   glosa   must _not_ appear anywhere in the "name"
field.  In the second case, it is *necessary* that my name _not_ appear
in the name field but that the word   glosa   be the only word in the
name field, even though my email address appears.

    As I mentioned, this is experimental, and I do not guarantee that 
I have all the wrinkles ironed out.  Also, it is possible that this
discussion group, being experimental, could go away at any time on
short notice.

    Let me clear up a possible confusion.  You are *NOT* automatically
a member of this experimental discussion group.  You are only a member
if you explicitly ask to be.  My previous message was only to make
people aware of its existence.

Bill, Hi!

        Nice to have you aboard, as they say in nautical circles.

        One bit of news is that it works out we are not quite ready, yet,
after all.  I am attempting a manually-operated, no-cost Mailing List, and
my ISP has
typed in a small program into his computer, plus allocated me a location
where I can put the list of e-mail addresses.  

        Your name is on that list, and hence you got my broadcast, and I got
your "Reply."  BUT my ISP informed me that he hadn't arranged it so that
"Replies" go back to all  glosalist  subscribers; I got your reply, but
no-one else did.

        HOWEVER, we have back-up.  Paul Bartlett, another subscriber and ex-
programmer, has done a better job with creating a "Reflector" inside his
Internet connection, so, as soon as he is happy with its operation, I will
ask people to head their Glosa List contributions ...
         To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
   ... I know his system recycles replies back to all List-members: I have
sent replies back to Paul and John - in our test group of three.

        I have sent Paul the "List" and when he gives me the nod, I will
broadcast a call for people to use the new "Reflector" system.  Until then -
and afterwards - the   glosalist   address, you used, is functional (with
limitations).  All we need to do is to avoid the "Reply" button, and
"Redirect"  or "Forward" replies to the list, by typing in
glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au   at the 
"To:" prompt.  Then it will operate like a normal Mailing List.

        Re the Glosa 6000 scan: it is still in the process of topping and
tailing, but your resopnse elevates it to Priority 1.  The authors have not
yet authorised me to make "6000" available electronically, so I will have to
use the hard-copy/snail-mail system to get it to you.  Needless to say,
"Glosa 6000" should be available through the bookstores, and this is how the
authors survive financially ... but I am of the opinion that a Shareware
release would ony tend to boost hardcopy sales.

        Please send questions about, and expectations of, Glosa to the
glosalist  now that I know its broadcast facility is working.  Have you
downloaded my Glosa version of the Three Bears?  I will post it to the group
as a little light reading.

Saluta,
 Robin

Karo Bill,
        One or two comments on the Tri Ursus story:-
. I firstly tried translating into Glosa from an English language original. This
        did not work because of vocabulary difficulties, but more
importantly         because of the difficulties inherent in the syntax of
English.
. I then decide to 'retell' the story in Glosa, and this took a lot of
strain         off me!  I was not restricted by the ideosyncratic usages of
English.
. After writing every sentence, I reread it out aloud, and listened for the
sound, felt how comfortable it was in the mouth, and tried to recall
from the words my original intent in the communication.
. If the new sentence sounded unpleasant, felt awkward as I said it, or
did not immediately bring back to mind what I had originally meant to 
        say, then I scrapped the sentence and started again.
. The "Bears" was a learning experience for me.  It was the first of my
three         favourite children to receive the "re-dice in Glosa"
treatment.  I would
        like to compile a primer of easy-reading stories for learners of Glosa.
. If you wish to develop the art of writing in Glosa, you might pick another
such children's story to retell.  We can edit it if this is necessary,
and, if a few more do it, then we will have enough to print a primer.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ORGANISATIONAL
        The "glosalist" Mailing List is not re-broadcasting "Replies".

        I will ask you to change over to the alternative organised by Paul
Bartlett - and tested with two others of us - for the purpose of trouble-free
group involvement.  Basically, instead of sending Glosa discussion to 

        glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au     use    glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

at the "To:" prompt.

        However, Paul will ask everyone to go through the application
process, and so will want you to "Request" to join with a short message sent to 

        Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

requesting to join the Experimental Glosa Discussion Group.  Afer that, with
your address on his list, everyting anyone sends 
        To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
will be `reflected' to everyone else on Paul's list.  Meanwhile I will see
what I can do to get the original idea into working order.

        ??? Please share your interest in the idea of Auxiliary Language,
and what you expect of Glosa.  But just to get us all in the one place,
please go through Paul's "Request " process.

Saluta,
 Robin

I like that idea. Sounds like a good glosalist group project.

        The pothole in the Superhighway, that caught my wheel, was that
responses to "glosalist" contributions were sent back ONLY to the one who
submitted the original message - not an ALL TO ALL system by any means!!!

        Until the glitch is fixed, or my ISP installs commercial Mailing
List software, Paul Bartlett has created an automatic =Mail Forwarder= that
really is "all-to-all", and, so, he will be able to service our discussions,
while the subscription list is small.

        Following protocol, Paul has asked people to request to have their
e-mail address added to the "Experimental Glosa Mail Forwarder" before they
get all rebroadcast messages.  So, please send a message, or "Redirect" this
present message, with a line like `Please add me to the Mail Forwarder'
exactly to
   To: Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

        Paul will confirm receipt of you request.  After that, please send
normal Glosa discussions exactly to
   To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

        Once the "glosalist" is operational, with a full recursive function, 
we can seamlessly change back to it, and carry on as if all this unnecessary
confusion had not occurred.  With apologies for the inconvenience.

Saluta,
 Robin

P.S. During the coming week I will send notes on the Syntax used by Glosa.  R
P.P.S. N.B. This is NOT to be called a `Mailing List'.  To cover Paul's
agreement with his ISP, it is the "Experimental Glosa Mail Forwarder", or
"Forwarder" for short.  Thanks.  R

Keep up the good Lo-tech work Bill,
        Just a quick reply.  I must visit your Page soon, but not till I
complete the neatening up of the "Glosa 6000" file: possibly your Snail Mail
address is given in your Page.  
        I still do not have permission to put the "6000" into the Public Domain,
so must send hard-copy.
        Which story, or stories, are you thinking about working on?  I would
use the more ~descriptive~ form of the language for such ... intended, as
they are, for children and learners.  The alternative ~telegramatic~ form of
Glosa, used in Plu Glosa Nota articles, is fairly highly elided
(abbreviated, with some ##optional## function-words omitted).  The
descriptive use of Glosa has all the function-words in place, to *shoe-horn*
readers into the correct understanding of the text.

        Paul informs me that you have requested being on the "Forwarder":
thank you.
Saluta,
 Robin

Karo Paul,
        Point about getting the introductory info on Glosa into Fr. Sp. &
Ger. is well taken.  Sorry I'm not a polyglot!
        The authors could translate into all those, but, on your Page, you
would like to have exact translations of the existing English ... you should
ask them to do the translations for you - providing them with a copy of your
original.  I could, of course, submit a Glosa version of same, as could they.
        If you wish me to try a Glosa version of your introduction, please
send me a copy, or indicate "From where" ... "To where" in your Page.
        On the question of WRAP-AROUND, are you still getting it with this
message?  If so, I will pull in my Right Margin another half-inch, to leave
a one inch gap between the Eudora active area and the edge of my screen.
        I have, just now, sent out a call to join the "Forwarder" using the GL
"super-nickname" but you will know this: PaulB is within this grouping; and
you will have received a copy, too.
Saluta,
 Robin

Bill, Thankyou,
        I have worked consistently on getting the scanned "6000" files into
corrected and `printer ready' form.  And now we are ready for lift off!

        So, I'll just print them to-morrow before work.  Later I might
arrange the pages so I can double-side the print to save on postage, but
won't worry about that for now.  I will send some info re Glosa writing on
the Mail Forwarder to-morrow, also.  I would like to know your particular
interest in Glosa, to help me flesh in your details.  Please send qestions
you would like answered ... preferably through the Forwarder. IE   
                      To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
Saluta,
