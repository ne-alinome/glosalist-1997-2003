I have changes my PC from W95 to W98 and hope to have left the gobbledygook 
behind! I should like to know how common the English's passive mood is in 
other languages. Someone in the New Scientist was asking students to avoid PM 
and use active mood more. To avoid much use of "I" and "we", the two pronouns 
could be ommitted - "I mixed acid..." could become "mixed acid...." similarly 
Glosa could do without "ge-" ..........

Yup.

Nope.

That is a classic problem for auxlangs. As I understand it, the cause
is a conflict between two desires: to put the most important thing first
in the sentence, versus the semantic agent or cause of the action:

The MOUSE fell.        <---- nominative case, non-agentive, active voice
The mouse WAS droppED. <---- same semantically, but passive voice
The mouse was dropped BY the cat. <---- passive, with oblique agent
The cat dropped the MOUSE.        <---- active, with accusative patient
The cat dropped the mouse TO the floor. <---- now add an oblique location

In each instance, the subject is the thing of most importance.
Where the voice is active, the subject is formally an agent;
where passive, a "patient" (which I won't even try to define).
It is a great simplification to always use a preposition for
oblique cases, even the English "indirect object". But we still
must distinguish whether the subject is agent or patient.

You suggest eliminating the fronted "nominative" case, which would be
quite radical in Glosa; then the pre-verbal noun is automatically
an agent/ergative and the post-verbal is a patient/accusative.
Another alternative would be to add explicit prepositions for the
ergative ("per"?) and accusative ("em"?) cases, leaving none unmarked.

All of these methods have been used successfully in natural languages.
But the boring nominative/accusative style (with "ge-") is most common,
especially in Europe, so I think we're stuck with it.

Does that mean that you have the dreaded gbldk?
sent a mail to my son who had no problems, shall join freeserve and send 
stuff to myself there and also from there ..........
here is some stuff in .nng :-

nenege libele mo;

per-u .edra du cerke de plu ma bono e ma naturu metodo te orti .

bono=good (adjective -metodo)
cerke=search (head of VP)
de= of etc
du starts VP present tense
e=and
.edra= HDRA= Henry Doubleday Research Association
ma=more (adverb with adj bono/naturu)
metodo=method (head of NP)
naturu=nature/natural
orti=garden (head VP)
per-u=a/the, starts subject NP
plu=a/the plural
te starts VP no tense

nenege libele bi;
u .edra du cerke de plu ma bono e ma naturu metodo te orti .
u=a/the singular
the NP before the VP is the subject unless otherwise signalled, the object 
will usually follow the VP.

Glosa when written by me......
U H.D.R.A. du cerke de plu ma bono e ma naturu metodo te horti.
Cosmetic capitals are used, I keep the NNG final vowels as many of them are 
free anyway in Glosa (I've seen "verba" and "verbe" for instance) and I use 
"du" to mark the VP as I've quite often found Glosa hard to decypher without 
the marker. Recently "ergo" could have been N or V in one sentence and the 
sentence needed a certain amount of thought to clarify. "pa cerke" or "fu 
cerke" would have been quick and easy.

English;
HDRA is searching for better and more natural methods of gardening.


passive will come up ere long........
