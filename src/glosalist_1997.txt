Hello Friends, 
        This is a first message to sixteen subscribers, not a test.

        Which lexicon are you using for selection of Glosa words?  There are
basically two lists: Glosa 1000 and Glosa 6000.  But there are also "Glosa
Central" and "Glosa Classified" lists, with some variations between each
list - as pointed out to me recently by Paul Bartlett.

        So, for those with a copy of "Glosa 1000", your use of words will be
economical in the extreme.  This `starting vocabulary' has only one root
(Greek or Latin) for each concept, and allows you to get the feel of the
language.  Now, if you really are trying to say something complicated, this
beginners'
dictionary will hardly satisfy you.

        In "Glosa 6000" there are some synonyms (both Greek and Latin roots
for one concept), and there is a much wider choice of words to allow the
speaker/writer more freedom.  I can speak from experience that the writer
will find it boring and repetitive if the alternative root is not available.
So, for good style, the synonyms are essential.  However, in a query
language situation involving man/machine interaction, there is a strong case
for using only one root per concept.  

        For people who do not have the larger dictionary, I have a scanned
version of the "6000", and will clean it up to print and post copies to
those who request it.  A copy of the "Glosa Classified" wordlist is
available through my website: this features the core thousand words grouped
according to their linguistic function.

        To get started with using Glosa, it is a good idea to buy the "18
Steps to Fluency in Euro-Glosa."  I will be guided by your wishes - aiming
to give part of my time here to teaching the usage of Glosa, and the other
time to discussing the language and means of dissemination.

Saluta,
 Robin

Well, for what it isworth, I use all, though I try the '1000' first, 
since it is small.  It is amazing how much you can say with such a 
limited vocabulary, although nuances and style ae quite another matter.  
I happen to prefer the Greek choices over the Latin, but that is a 
personal matter of taste -- I think I can recognize both in most instances.

Since the list is up, best wishes to all.  Henceforward I'll try to write 
in Glosa.

Subject: Experimental Glosa Discussion Group
To: fearn{at}compuserve{dot}com; William
Date: Wed, 23 Jul 97 12:2

To recipients of this email interested in Glosa:

    On an experimental basis, I have set up an email discussion 
group for the following purposes:

1) Discussion of Glosa as an international auxiliary language;
2) Practice in using Glosa with positive feedback from others.

Please note that this is NOT a conventional mailing list as often
found on the Internet.  There is no automatic subscription,
unsubscription, archive retrieval, help files, and so on.  It is merely
a central point to which you can send an email for either or both of
the above purposes and have it distributed to other discussion group
members.

    To join this group, just send an email to the following address:

To: Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

and ask to join the group.  Note that it is important that the word
glosa   itself not appear anywhere in the above address.

    After you have joined the group, if you want to send an email to
other group members for group purposes, send an email addressed as
follows:

To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

It is critical that you note the difference in addressing.  In the
first case, the word   glosa   must _not_ appear anywhere in the "name"
field.  In the second case, it is *necessary* that my name _not_ appear
in the name field but that the word   glosa   be the only word in the
name field, even though my email address appears.

    As I mentioned, this is experimental, and I do not guarantee that 
I have all the wrinkles ironed out.  Also, it is possible that this
discussion group, being experimental, could go away at any time on
short notice.

    Let me clear up a possible confusion.  You are *NOT* automatically
a member of this experimental discussion group.  You are only a member
if you explicitly ask to be.  My previous message was only to make
people aware of its existence.

Bill, Hi!

        Nice to have you aboard, as they say in nautical circles.

        One bit of news is that it works out we are not quite ready, yet,
after all.  I am attempting a manually-operated, no-cost Mailing List, and
my ISP has
typed in a small program into his computer, plus allocated me a location
where I can put the list of e-mail addresses.  

        Your name is on that list, and hence you got my broadcast, and I got
your "Reply."  BUT my ISP informed me that he hadn't arranged it so that
"Replies" go back to all  glosalist  subscribers; I got your reply, but
no-one else did.

        HOWEVER, we have back-up.  Paul Bartlett, another subscriber and ex-
programmer, has done a better job with creating a "Reflector" inside his
Internet connection, so, as soon as he is happy with its operation, I will
ask people to head their Glosa List contributions ...
         To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
   ... I know his system recycles replies back to all List-members: I have
sent replies back to Paul and John - in our test group of three.

        I have sent Paul the "List" and when he gives me the nod, I will
broadcast a call for people to use the new "Reflector" system.  Until then -
and afterwards - the   glosalist   address, you used, is functional (with
limitations).  All we need to do is to avoid the "Reply" button, and
"Redirect"  or "Forward" replies to the list, by typing in
glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au   at the 
"To:" prompt.  Then it will operate like a normal Mailing List.

        Re the Glosa 6000 scan: it is still in the process of topping and
tailing, but your resopnse elevates it to Priority 1.  The authors have not
yet authorised me to make "6000" available electronically, so I will have to
use the hard-copy/snail-mail system to get it to you.  Needless to say,
"Glosa 6000" should be available through the bookstores, and this is how the
authors survive financially ... but I am of the opinion that a Shareware
release would ony tend to boost hardcopy sales.

        Please send questions about, and expectations of, Glosa to the
glosalist  now that I know its broadcast facility is working.  Have you
downloaded my Glosa version of the Three Bears?  I will post it to the group
as a little light reading.

Saluta,
 Robin

Karo Bill,
        One or two comments on the Tri Ursus story:-
. I firstly tried translating into Glosa from an English language original. This
        did not work because of vocabulary difficulties, but more
importantly         because of the difficulties inherent in the syntax of
English.
. I then decide to 'retell' the story in Glosa, and this took a lot of
strain         off me!  I was not restricted by the ideosyncratic usages of
English.
. After writing every sentence, I reread it out aloud, and listened for the
sound, felt how comfortable it was in the mouth, and tried to recall
from the words my original intent in the communication.
. If the new sentence sounded unpleasant, felt awkward as I said it, or
did not immediately bring back to mind what I had originally meant to 
        say, then I scrapped the sentence and started again.
. The "Bears" was a learning experience for me.  It was the first of my
three         favourite children to receive the "re-dice in Glosa"
treatment.  I would
        like to compile a primer of easy-reading stories for learners of Glosa.
. If you wish to develop the art of writing in Glosa, you might pick another
such children's story to retell.  We can edit it if this is necessary,
and, if a few more do it, then we will have enough to print a primer.

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
ORGANISATIONAL
        The "glosalist" Mailing List is not re-broadcasting "Replies".

        I will ask you to change over to the alternative organised by Paul
Bartlett - and tested with two others of us - for the purpose of trouble-free
group involvement.  Basically, instead of sending Glosa discussion to 

        glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au     use    glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

at the "To:" prompt.

        However, Paul will ask everyone to go through the application
process, and so will want you to "Request" to join with a short message sent to 

        Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

requesting to join the Experimental Glosa Discussion Group.  Afer that, with
your address on his list, everyting anyone sends 
        To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
will be `reflected' to everyone else on Paul's list.  Meanwhile I will see
what I can do to get the original idea into working order.

        ??? Please share your interest in the idea of Auxiliary Language,
and what you expect of Glosa.  But just to get us all in the one place,
please go through Paul's "Request " process.

Saluta,
 Robin

I like that idea. Sounds like a good glosalist group project.

        The pothole in the Superhighway, that caught my wheel, was that
responses to "glosalist" contributions were sent back ONLY to the one who
submitted the original message - not an ALL TO ALL system by any means!!!

        Until the glitch is fixed, or my ISP installs commercial Mailing
List software, Paul Bartlett has created an automatic =Mail Forwarder= that
really is "all-to-all", and, so, he will be able to service our discussions,
while the subscription list is small.

        Following protocol, Paul has asked people to request to have their
e-mail address added to the "Experimental Glosa Mail Forwarder" before they
get all rebroadcast messages.  So, please send a message, or "Redirect" this
present message, with a line like `Please add me to the Mail Forwarder'
exactly to
   To: Paul Bartlett <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

        Paul will confirm receipt of you request.  After that, please send
normal Glosa discussions exactly to
   To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

        Once the "glosalist" is operational, with a full recursive function, 
we can seamlessly change back to it, and carry on as if all this unnecessary
confusion had not occurred.  With apologies for the inconvenience.

Saluta,
 Robin

P.S. During the coming week I will send notes on the Syntax used by Glosa.  R
P.P.S. N.B. This is NOT to be called a `Mailing List'.  To cover Paul's
agreement with his ISP, it is the "Experimental Glosa Mail Forwarder", or
"Forwarder" for short.  Thanks.  R

Keep up the good Lo-tech work Bill,
        Just a quick reply.  I must visit your Page soon, but not till I
complete the neatening up of the "Glosa 6000" file: possibly your Snail Mail
address is given in your Page.  
        I still do not have permission to put the "6000" into the Public Domain,
so must send hard-copy.
        Which story, or stories, are you thinking about working on?  I would
use the more ~descriptive~ form of the language for such ... intended, as
they are, for children and learners.  The alternative ~telegramatic~ form of
Glosa, used in Plu Glosa Nota articles, is fairly highly elided
(abbreviated, with some ##optional## function-words omitted).  The
descriptive use of Glosa has all the function-words in place, to *shoe-horn*
readers into the correct understanding of the text.

        Paul informs me that you have requested being on the "Forwarder":
thank you.
Saluta,
 Robin

Karo Paul,
        Point about getting the introductory info on Glosa into Fr. Sp. &
Ger. is well taken.  Sorry I'm not a polyglot!
        The authors could translate into all those, but, on your Page, you
would like to have exact translations of the existing English ... you should
ask them to do the translations for you - providing them with a copy of your
original.  I could, of course, submit a Glosa version of same, as could they.
        If you wish me to try a Glosa version of your introduction, please
send me a copy, or indicate "From where" ... "To where" in your Page.
        On the question of WRAP-AROUND, are you still getting it with this
message?  If so, I will pull in my Right Margin another half-inch, to leave
a one inch gap between the Eudora active area and the edge of my screen.
        I have, just now, sent out a call to join the "Forwarder" using the GL
"super-nickname" but you will know this: PaulB is within this grouping; and
you will have received a copy, too.
Saluta,
 Robin

That's a tricky job but similar to one that I've done several
times myself. I examine the file to figure out how it's
structured, determine the best method of slicing and dicing, and
then usually use vim (*the* vi for DOS!), awk, sed, cut and/or
paste to do the dirty work. I wrote a program, first a DOS version
in C and then a Windows version in Visual Basic, a simple
multiple-choice flashcard kind of thing. Input for the programs is
vocabulary files I've found on the Net and processed this way.

The primary question is, what sort of file are we working with?
Best case: it's a plain old ascii file. Which is probably what you
got when you scanned the lexicon. Now, it's the Galaxy part that
frightens me since I know nothing of Galaxy. Word processors like
to insert unfriendly format characters into the file and this can
make the task harder.

If you'd like to send me the file (I know, there's some legalities
involved) or a portion of the file I might be able to give you a
hand.

Perhaps you would send me some information about the primeval
Galaxy? You've touched on a hobby of mine, retrocomputing in
general and text processing in particular.

{crossposted to Glosa Discussion Group}

Robin,

    I'll let you put this into decent Glosa if you want.  I hope my
reply to you via the group got through.  (I was having some technical
problems.)

    There may not be quite the technical difficulties with the Glosa
Discussion Group mail forwarder that I thought.  Unfortunately, there
are many mail agents out there, and not all of them act quite as
expected according to Internet standards.  To be honest, products which
run under Microsoft Windows are somewhat notorious for not quite
conforming to standards.  Not all of them honor a "Reply-To:" field in
quite the same way.

    If a group member is making a reply to a post, all that is
important is that it be addressed properly.  *HOW* that proper address
gets there is not important, just so long as it gets there.  It is
probably best not even to say, "I do it this way," because even the
terminology may be different for different mail agents, and saying 
"I do it this way" may just be confusing to other people using
different mail agents.

    (I hope everyone understands that the meachanics of this thing
are a rather amateur effort just to get something going.)

Regards,
Paul                             <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

    To: glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

The word before my email address must be EXACTLY the single
word 'glosa' (no quotes), or else the mail will wind up in 
my discard folder.  Do NOT say 'glosa list', 'glosa group', 
or anything else.  Just the single word.

Thank you.

Tom, Ave!
        Tu habe plus de bi-ze anua ma de mi.  Mi spe: mi fu es du kine iso

        Mi logi ke tu habe interese in lingua, sed mi ne pote vide tu akti

                revelation
                reverie.
        Mi ne pa detekti "reve" intra "Glosa 6000", mi "Shorter Latin

puta: "klari reve" = *clear revelation, or prophecy".

        Tu mesage pa gene a mi via u Glosalist adrese, e, si tu pa uti

[To-day I write about Glosa.  By comparing Glosa with the other designed
languages, we see a language with clean lines.  By using only the the roots
of the Classical words, we get a very clean feel from the language; it both
looks
and sounds good.]

>Kontra-co, qe buta de grega es dice de plu hetero ra, sed in Glosa?

No, u Grega habe plu vario buta: te dice de Glosa, te dice uti Glosa, e te

[No, the Group has various aims: to speak about Glosa, to speak using Glosa,
and to try to use Glosa to describe different areas of human activity.  EG
I have tried to retell several stories for children, using Glosa.
I wish that Glosa-pe would investigate various facets of the language, for
example:
        . the rules for generation of new words and compounds,
        . derivation of Glosa words for the use of computers,
        . derivation of Glosa words for use in the commercial world,
        . methods of instruction in Glosa for childern and adults,
        . methods of producing talking-books for commercial distribution,
        . discussion of the best ways of using this Glosa Discussion Group
(and subsequently the Glosalist) for the dissemination of Glosa ... the idea
of the language, and materials for self-teaching in Glosa,
        . but especially, I hope many people try the language to discover,
for themselves, the feel of the language, instead of using their time to
discus it.]

>Qe uno-pe pote me dice; uno-ra de u numera e munda-distribu de Glosa-pe?

U dificili qestio!  Tem dice de homi, Glosa habe nuli numera signifi: nu,
solo plu libe ge-menta persona tende tenta Glosa.  Na habe plura grega intra
plu maxi pove natio de Afrika, nota Uganda, e plu-ci eqa na maxi mega grega.
Il es oligo grega de plu Glosa-dice komunita, e maxi de plu Glose-pe gene

Glosa-pe pro mutua kambio de plu idea e te dona a na u sensi de grega-ra.

[A difficult question!  While speaking of mankind, Glosa has no numeric
significance: now, only free-minded people tend to try Glosa.  We have
several groups in the poorest nations of Africa, notably Uganda, and these
are our largest groups.  There are few groups of Glosa-speaking communities,
and most Glosa-pe learn the language in isolation.  This Internet location
is an attempt to collect the more active, and rich, Glosa-pe for the mutual
exchange of ideas, and to give us a sense of group-hood.]

[Despite your recent discovery of Glosa, you use the language easily,
possibly because of your work with the classically derived words in the
medical dictionaries.  But I believe that you have, also, a very logical
mind.  About your work status, I would create the compound term, "auto
ge-utor" (self employed).  UTOR, from the Latin dictionary, is not in the
"Glosa 6000" dictionary, it ought to be there.]

the functioning of this group.  As I sit here, reading your message, and
writing - in Glosa - to reply to it, I know that this is the functionof the
group!  Agreed, the computer works for us; we do not work for it.]

organisation of the Glosa Discussion Group, but when I see it I will react.
I understand that the creative qualities of women are most significant for

Yes, Tom,
        I seem to recall doing this poem before, and possibly this Glosa
version is the one I wrote out - translating it from either English or
Esperanto.  If it is my own style this explains the ease with which I
translate it into English:-

                Two things I know
                No-one can deny
                Everyone will err
                Everyone will die
                But one thing more 
                Don't be sad
                Everyone can {try.}      I suspect that you lost the final word!

It is v. late at night: sorry for not writing in Glosa.

Paul and Friends on the 'Mail forwarder,'
        A very quick reply in English:-
  . My Glosa gets easier with every posting I write to you: the Forwarder IS
a         good idea! 
  . Others, not connected to the Net, should, as Paul suggests, be included
in         the circle: it's just good sense.
  . I have a short list of Third Worlders involved in the 'Translingual Project'
        but will not release this list to all in the Forwarder/Glosalist
moiety,         just yet - for reasons of economics.  We, the Affluents,
have computers         and can pay subscription fees to our ISPs; many of
the Third Worlders -         notably those in Africa - have to save up just
to buy a stamp!
  . It is very hard to get money into Uganda, for instance: my letter with
an         Australian $20 note was opened in the post, but the note, which
could         not be cashed in Uganda, was left in it; another letter
carrying a U.S.         $2 went missing, altogether; very few outside banks
deal with Uganda.
  . First and Second Worlders, who have for some reason not joined the Net,
should be able to be reached by us Affluents, and their messages
circulated for global replies.  This could be achieved by our writing to
a small group of non-Netters, each, and retyping their hand-written
replies, posting these to the group on the Net.  Maybe a copy of the
letter we post to non-Netters would be included with the response, when
we send the non-Netting Glosa-pe letter to the Glosa Grega.  This would
be an experiment in developing the "Virtual Internet."
  . Such a list of consenting Glosa-pe would have to come from the authors.
We         might try it with, say, ten non-Netters at the start, just to see
if we         can handle the situation.
  . I wait, daily, to hear that my ISP has successfully installed Majordomo,
his         preferred Mailing List software, so we can continue at our
permanent            site, here at glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au{dot}  I will keep
people informed about         this development.
  * Paul earlier asked for other language publicity about Glosa.  Has anyone
thought about this, yet?  Screed on Glosa in German, French, Italian and
Spanish - in electronic form - could easily be inserted in Webpages and
printed to be sent by pidgeon post.  
  # At present, we are working in towards the middle bulk of the human

Mi Plu Karo Amika,
        Sadly, I write this in English - for reasons of time.

        Paul Bartlett has reminded me that it is over a week since anything
happened on the Mail Forwarder.  Now, I will do my bit to change all this,
and must start sending interesting notes on, and in, Glosa ... on a regular,
hopefully daily, basis.  Also, Paul pointed out that what I thought was good
formatting of information often got mangled as it went through the system.
I will keep my formatting very simple, henceforth.

        The explanation for my quietness is that I have been using my ASCII
word-processor and DOS's SORT.EXE to change the  Glosa --> English  entries
in the "Glosa 6000" dictionary to  English --> Glosa  ones.

        I have already done a seventeen page double-sided, triple-columned
version of the "Glosa 6000"  Glosa--> English  list, and have printed and
sent one to John Schilke.  I am sending these, free, to Glosalist/Mail
Forwarder people; so, let me know if you don't have "Glosa 6000," and would
like this list.  The  English --> Glosa  list will take a bit longer: I am
only up to the E's, and have to go through ordering the synonyms, and
sometimes clarifying meanings.  With the list, there are some questions you
might help me to answer.

        I am trying to fit the English word plus its Glosa equivalents into
twenty-four spaces.  Also, if I have space to note the Greek origins of
words, I do: this is three spaces (,G.).  I have tried to keep each words
listing down to the single line, but this is not always possible, if there
are multiple synonyms listed.

        I am experimenting with the idea that some groups of Classical
alternatives are equivalent, while, within some of the Glosa collections of
words there is one, or possibly two, preferred ones.  For example:-

dust FARINA;KONIDIO,G.; 
 PULVE
[All are equivalent, or shown to be so.]

drop(a drop) GUTA
 & STAGMO,G.;STILA
[One is shown as preferred: the others are alternatives. Would it be best if
all multiple entries suggested one, such, preferred Glosa word?]

dry SIKA;ARIDI
 & AZALE,G.;KAPIRO,G.;
   TORIDI;XERO,G.
[Here I suggest that SIKA is the first preference, while ARIDI is the
synonym, and the other four are possibles, if necessary.]

        Should one first preference be given (first) for all multiple entries?

        I would like to hear your views on this - as learners of Glosa.
What would you like to find in an English --> Glosa dictionary/word list?  I
have found it necessary to give additional information in a number of
entries ... as in the case of "drop". This is not the action of "dropping
something, which would be LASE KADE, but a small sphere of liquid, hence
"drop(a drop)".

        After checking out alpha and beta versions on you and the Third
World Glosa-pe, I will negotiate with the authors to sell these print-outs
to the public ... needless to say with a "royalties" payment to the authors
for each one sold.

        I look forward to your feedback.
Saluta,
 Robin

Interesting, that Glosa should have so many synonyms. And also
interesting, that when many synonyms are available, the preferred
set may contain more than one. Sounds to me like there's some
historical explanation here, and enquiring minds want to know!

For any group of synonyms, I'd like to see one, the first, as
the preferred word. Synonyms are good, but to make sure that
everybody begins with the same base vocabulary, one word should
be chosen as *the* preferred word.

    Unfortunately, there is not 100% consistency in the Glosa
publications.  The terminal vowels of some words differ from
publication to publication.  This is unfortunate, because there 
are a few pairs of _different_ words which differ only by 
single terminal vowel, so this is a source of confusion.  As for the 
spelling checker, remember that you can have your own dictionary 
of words in addition to the supplied compiled dictionary.

Subject: Word Formation in Glosa
To: glosa
Date: Wed, 17 Sep 97 10:2

{Posted to the Glosa Discussion Group}
{Cc: to Glosa Education Organization}

    A few thoughts on vocabulary and word formation in Glosa.  I
apologize that this is not in Glosa itself, but it sort of illustrates
my point.

    As I mentioned in a response, there is some inconsistency in the
published documents.  Sometimes the same word has different terminal
vowels in different documents.  (Salta/salti was pointed out.)  This is
confusing, because there are other Glosa word pairs which differ only
by the terminal vowel but have different meanings.  (Such as
seta/seti.)

    It seems to be claimed that anything worth saying can be expressed
in Glosa 1000, but there is no consistent list of 1000 words.  When I
collated different lists from different "Glosa 1000"'s for the Web
pages, I came up with well over 1000 words.

    Having two Glosa words for the same thing, one from a Greek root
and one from a Latin root, is counterproductive.  If you learn Glosa
Word A for something and I learn Glosa Word B, we still cannot
communicate.  Having everybody learn both A and B is redundant and
superfluous in a language which is supposed to minimize the learning
burden.

    Vocabulary size is always a bugaboo in any planned auxiliary
language.  On the one hand, there is the wholesome desire to minimize
vocabulary in order to minimize the learning and usage burden.  On the
other hand, there can be difficulty for adequate expression with a
minimimal vocabulary.  One technique that has been used repeatedly in
auxiliary language proposals with relatively good results (my opinion)
is word formation from existing words by means of lexical affixes.

    Glosa does have seventeen "Generics" (-BO-PE is simply a compound
of two others) taken wholesale from Hogben's Interglossa.  This is a
good staring point, but I wonder if consideration should be given to
adding a few more.  (Notice that I said a "few," not a lot.) I have not
at this time worked out any suggestions, but I notice that the existing
seventeen generics all relate to concrete nouns.  Perhaps the
vocabulary could be extended somewhat without significantly adding to
the learning burden by a few judicious additions to the generics list
for concepts other than for concrete nouns (such as for expressing
abstractions or for extending or modifying the meanings of existing
words).  I do like the idea of the generics being two-letter
consonant-vowel forms.

    A few observations/thoughts.

Regards,
Paul                             <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>

{Cc: to Glosa Education Organization}

    In my post of earlier today, I should have added a couple of points.
The existing Generics in Glosa are derived from existing words and serve
as a kind of shorthand for them.  I think this is an excellent idea, as
it minimizes the learning burden and allows for more concise expression.
Also, there are the five prefixes:

        no-  reversal of meaning
        ne-  negation of meaning (not necessarily reversal)
        ge-  coming into being or being acted upon
        fe-  explicitly female
        an-  explicitly male

More excellent ideas/constructs in the existing language.

    A few ideas for additional generics do come into mind.  (These
are not hard and fast.)

        -ri  (abstRaktI)   abstraction
        -li  (abiLI)       able to be; possibility
        -ti  (akTI)        action or expression
        -le  (skLEro)      concrete expression (in general)
        -ce  (faCE)        causative; make, render
        -pa  (sePAra)      separation, dispersal
        -ga  (greGA)       aggregation, drawing together
        -ro  (mikRO)       diminution
        -gi  (GrandI)      augmentation
        -re  (itera, RE-)  repetition

    Again, I want to emphasize that I am not trying to expand things
all out of proportion.  The language should be adequately expressive
but still as reasonably concise as possible.  A scheme something like
this would have five prefixes and twenty-seven generic suffixes, which
I think would be brushing an upper limit, but it might allow for word
formation without having to expand the base vocabulary a great deal and
without having to use a lot of periphrasis to express basic notions.

re- is already listed as a prefix, so this suggestion is redundant.

As I mentioned to Robin, I like synonyms but I think that there
should always be just one *preferred* word, and that's the one to
learn first - save the synonyms for when you want to get fancy,
and immediate understanding is not the issue. (Robin's problem

metoo! metoo! E Qestio: Does anybody know the reasoning behind
these choices of Generics? Some seem obvious to me, some less so,
and I particularly like "-li", the Stone Generic; I've been
collecting stones for as long as I can remember, and am fascinated
by standing stones and such, and in fact my oldest boy is sitting
nearby playing with some stones right now.

In general, the Generics seem to have a nice homey feel and I'm
certain that the story behind these choices would be of interest.

But if a Stone Generic, why not a Wood Generic? Besides the fact
that we might suffer a "-li" collision, since "ligni" also begins
with those same two letters. Was stone considered to be more
important than wood? Was this a sign of the times or an insight
into the minds of the authors?

    The Generics are presicely the same as in Hogben's original
Interglossa.  I do not have a copy of that book, and the only 
copy I have ever perused I found a little hard to read because of 
the style.  (It was in a library from which I could not check it 
out, and I was a little cramped for time.)  I do not recall whether 
Hogben justified his specific choices.

Saluta Bill,
        I concur: one synonym is more than enough.  I suspect that the Glosa
authors were being generous with the languages, and included a number of
Classical roots with similar meanings, rather than being ruthless, and
restricting usage.  If one English word had two approxiamte equivalents, one
Greek and the other Latin, that should be enough: and, for the sake of
learners, the dictionary should show one word (Greek or Latin; it doesn't
matter which, just so long as one is chosen as the better word for the job)
as the preferred first choice!
        I am sending my Eng --> Glosa scanned list to the authors asking for
elucidation on this.  Mainly, I want to break up synonym clusters into
meaningful usable chunks (of one, or two, Classical roots each).  Up to now
they have not wished me to release the scanned version of their Glosa to
English "Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Net.  I am loathe to go against this,
but can see that if I sought help from members of the Glosalist moity, then
we would benefit from your advice and combined language knowlege on this.

What does the group think?  Should I ask the authors to release the Net
publication of the scanned "Glosa 6000" to restricted use by the Glosalist
group, for research purposes only, and not for general publication?  Or
should I select only the troublesome synonym clusters and ask for your help
to tease them out, straight away?  This might result in my printing a number
of synonym groups, asking you to help me break them down to more finely
defined entries,
so that the pattern could be like:-

englishword GLOSA1;
 GLOSA2;GLOSA3;GLOSA4;
 GLOSA5
  
  changes to

englishword GLOSA1 & GLOSA2
englishword(modifier1) GLOSA3
englishword(modifier2) GLOSA4 & GLOSA5

[NB I am aiming at a line-length of only 24 - 26, because I want to compile
the dictionary with three columns per page, giving pagewidths of 72 - 78
spaces.]

In this restricted space, how is it best to indicate the synonym: I have
suggested the convention " & SYNONYM".  Also, the ".G." tag telling us that
the Classical root is Greek, not Latin, is handy, but I did clip it when
this interferred with my linelength.  What does the group think about the
value of thes Greek markers?

On the matter of pagewidth, I have had trouble alraeady with linelength that
wrap-around, and also with tricky formatting that gets mangled as it goes
through the Internet.
        Now my Eudora right hand margin has been pulled in about five
spaces, and I have sworn to avoid all but the simplest of formattings.  The
3-column
dictionary would not get through the Net unaltered unless it was only 72
spaces wide, and all of the empty spaces were filled in with full stops.  At
this stage, I plan it as an ASCII, hard-copy printed production.  After all,
my main target population is the non-plugged-in masses of the Third World.

Saluta,
 Robin

    Bluntly put, they should have been ruthless here.  If you learn A
and I learn B, we still cannot communicate.  Why should both of us have
to learn two words when one will do?  An auxiliary language,
particularly one which seeks to function with a restricted vocabulary,
should deliberately avoid this sort of complication.

Oh yes! I'll confess my selfish motive immediately: I have a low

been using computers for too long - it's so much easier to search
a textfile - make the computer do the lookup. After I've learned
more of the language a hardcopy dictionary will be ideal, but for
now, in the beginning, the files that I've obtained from the
websites are a *great* help. Later, when I know Most of the words
instead of Few of the words - that's when hardcopy really becomes
valuable for me. Then I can take more time and thumb through the
dictionary in a more leisurely fashion, finding not only the
unknown word but also learning several others along the way.

And it would help Glosa by helping us...

> Or should I select only the troublesome synonym clusters and
> ask for your help to tease them out...

...for example, in analyzing these synonym clusters we might
want to search for similar words, or related words, or antonyms
and such - it's hard to predict where the research might take us.
Today I needed a couple of direction words. I really liked orienta
and austra, and that's what I used. But I also took note of the
synonyms (est and sud) which are shorter, and would be handy if
you were to be using them often - and wondered about the other
directions. grep... grep... (if you're not familiar with unix,
that's a file search) Hmmm. Nord/boreo and uest/ocide. Once again
I liked the longer forms but the shorter words are, well, shorter,
and more familiar-looking to me. Then I thought... directions. Like
on a map. We might want to abbreviate them. Boreo, Orienta, Austra,
Ocide. BOAO. Too (two!) many Os. Nord, Est, Sud, Uest. NESU.
Uniqueness!

(This also reminded me of Adventure games. I bet it would be much
easier to teach a computer to understand Glosa than most other
languages. Glosa software, anybody?)

So for brevity and abbreviation, I'd say that we should pick Nord,
Est, Sud and Uest as the preferred words and the longer words
as the synonyms.

Ouch. Just had another thought. That's good for written Glosa,
but what about spoken Glosa? I bet Est and Uest sound pretty
similar over a radio or telephone. For some special applications
we might want to reverse the preferences. Maybe the long words
should be the preferred words, with the short ones for special
written uses like maps and streetsigns...

So many things to think about.

> What does the group think about the value of these Greek markers?

Certainly of interest for etymological study, but unnecessary for
everyday dictionary use, so I'd say forget about them if they're
causing any trouble. They can be kept elsewhere where there's
more space.

Send it as an attachment and Eudora shouldn't mess with it at all.
It's only when you send it in the body of the message that Eudora
does its own formatting.

Seems like a pretty good first try, to me.  One hint that I think will come
up more in Glosa is an application of some of the ideas in Functional Grammar.
These may not have been worked out fully yet - for English - but I think
that the more regularised Glosa will operate using a limited set of the
Functional Grammar rules.

*       O.K. Bill,
Got your message, and the later one about the benefit to Glosa of releasing 
the "Glosa 6000" scanned version to Glosalist Subscribers.

On the technical (Internet) side,I would like to ask about your line-length:
does the word "line-length" appear on the right hand or left hand side of
your screen.  E-mail from you through the forwarder seemed to have short
line-length, and I wondered if normal-length lines wrapped around you screen.

On seeing the redirected offer from me, above, I deduce that all of the
normal line-length stuff over the Net gets 'wrapped around' your screen.
But the fault might be at my end .. though I don't think so.

If I place the three-column dictionary on the Net, it will take you and Paul
Bartlett a month just to re-adjust the formatting; I have already pulled in
the RHS margin in my Eudora 'Message Writer' half an inch as a result of "wrap-
around" complaints from Paul.  It looks as if I will have to pull it in a
total of two inches to avoid Wrap-around for you.  Which is best: using
Bartlett-
acceptable lines, or shortening them to the Will.Patt standard?

So, If I print and send hard-copy of the G-E dictionary, I should also
include a disk carrying this three-column, printable file .. as well as
single column,
readily computer readable versions of both the G-E and E-G creations.  I
have only I Mb of RAM, so the lists will be in bits that you can join up if
the whole dictionary will fit into your RAM. In DOS, I simply use COPY A+B C
to produce file C from the two other files.  Are you in DOS or Macintosh?  I
will include a copy of the programs GALAXY.EXE and L6.COM that allowed me,
together with the 
DOS SORT.EXE, to laboriously swap sides, sort, and format the dictionary.
Sadly, I didn't try sort until after I had compiled the three-column G-E
version.  This will have to be redone before I go commercial - offering
hard-copy versions for sale to the public.  Oh yes, Galaxy is a DOS ASCII
word processer: its poweful Macro function allowed me to queue in strings of
keystrokes that made creation of the dictionaries possible.

P.S. I decided to think, and, although the above message was written with
the wider lines, I have just pulled in the RHS margin in the middle of
writing, and the whole thing reformatted to fit the narrower page.  It
should all fit your system without wrap-around!!  Should I do this for all
messages sent to the Forwarder?

        I, too, find the longer forms more attractive, mainly for reasons of
poetry and mystique, but the shorter forms are definitely more suitable for
pedestrian use.  In rushing through the "Glosa 6000" listings I hadn't the
time for this level of cogitation: I should check back and change this in
line with the  North BOREO;NORD  pattern.

        I see it as a Ph.D. task waiting to be snapped up: fitting Glosa -
or a sub-set of it - to computers to work as a Query Language.

    As for the issue of putting Glosa 6000 into machine-readable form
(I have a paper copy), that is largely a copyright issue with GEO in
Richmond.  However, I think there is another issue involved.  One of
the claimed strengths of Glosa is size of vocabulary.  Collation of the
various versions of "Glosa 1000" has turned up noticeably more than
1000 words, as I have mentioned before.  At the same time, I think it
unwise to expand the base vocabulary all out of proportion.  That is
why I think a small handful of additional non-concrete-noun affixes
would serve well.  In my opinion there is such a thing as too small: 
I doubt that a language with a vocabulary so small that it would all 
fit on one sheet of paper in medium type would be adequate.  At the 
same time, a base vocabulary too large could be a hindrance.  It would 
not be a "simplification" in Robin's words.

It appeared on the right hand side. But as you see above, it
gets wrapped in my reply. Usually I reformat quoted text in a
reply (as long as it doesn't change meaning) to make it look
better. This time I did not, on purpose, so that you could see
what happens when I reply.

When I send messages that are likely to get quoted I make my
lines shorter on purpose so that a few levels of quoting can
occur before things start wrapping around. I try to keep the
original text around 60-some characters or so in width so that
a few ">"s in front won't shove any text to the next line.

No - no fault anywhere! I'm just using shorter lines.
Your messages are coming through just fine.

Don't worry about me - no problem! And be sure to let me know if
there's anything I can help you with. Like the reformatting you
speak of below.

I've used Eudora before and like it a lot. Right now I'm using
Microsoft Mail simply because that's what my new ISP gave me.
For Net distribution, you really should try using attachments.
When I was using Eudora I think it could only do one attachment
at a time, but it may be able to do more now. Anyway, if you
send the file as an attachment it will get here *exactly* as
it is on your disk, no reformatting or wrapping at all. Try
it! Send me a chunk, full width, and let's see!

> I have only I Mb of RAM, so the lists will be in bits that you

I'm using DOS with a lot of UNIX-like utilities, and VIM for
most of my editing. I'd love to see GALAXY and L6 - I'm a
sucker for textprocessing tools.

Don't worry, Robin, really! It all looks fine to me!

of function words i.e. too quickly, or without time for them to be processed
by the brain, then a form of mental constipation obtains.

Subject: Setimana, Compounds & Synonyms
To: William
Date: Fri, 26 Sep 97 19:5


Today I discovered something important about "setimana" (week) which
I probably should have noticed before. I think that the significance
escaped me because the Glosa word has those same s-m-n sounds as
Esperanto "semajno" and Ido "semano", so I just thought of it as a
discrete unit. And perhaps those words have the same parentage but
it was never so clear to me.

Anyway, it occurred to me that "setimana" begins with "seti" (seven)
and there are seven days in a week. Could "mana" have meaning of its
own? Sure enough, "mana" is "morning" - "seven mornings" - I like
that! Plus, we get three words for the price of two.

Now, based upon this, I suspect the existence of a collection of
words, actually compounds but so common and useful that they appear
in the dictionary as standalone words in their own right. And this
suggests another criterion to be used in our selection of the primary
word in any group of synonyms. Glosa "seven" is either "seti" or
"septi" and "morning" is either "mana" or "matina". For some twisted
reason I seem to prefer "septi" and "matina", probably resonance with
other languages I've studied, but I'd argue that the preferred words
should be "seti" and "mana" for consistency with "setimana".

Of course, we could choose "septi" and "matina" and coin a new,
preferred word for week, "septimatina" - the important point being
that we retain consistency among the involved words, including other
compound words that might use one or the other of the smaller words.

Conflicts will undoubtedly arise, but I think it would be beneficial
if we considered these compound words when choosing our preferences.

*       Yes, I would like to get the authors aware that some of us wonder

*       Agreed, these are already in place, and should be taught as prefixes. 
They cover only negation (two types), grammar (past participle) and gender.  
Possibly there are some more that could be added.  To me the "feel" is very
important: when we say the prefix, does the sound embody the concept that is
assigned to the letters used?

>
*       They look reasonable, and worth trying.  I would like to see these used 
in sentences to guage the "feel" they give.  Others on the Forwarder might
like to suggest suffixes (consonant, vowel type), for categories not
otherwise covered.  I would like a prefix, for example, to cover the idea of
"some of."
For some time, now, I've imagined DES, from the French, doing the job, but
it might be more consistent to use DE- before a measurable concept-word to
convey this, EG  U familia pa fago de-pani.  vs.  Pro prima-vora mu pa habe
des pani.

        Bill Patterson mentioned the possible use of -LI for either 
"of rock"  - from LITO,
"of wood"  - from LIGNI
 
Hogben used -LI = "of stone, rock", and so does the Glosa list of generics.
        Glosa could use -RO from ROKA for "of rock"
        and -LI for "of wood", but this would cause confusion.

        My guess is that since -LI has been set ~in stone~ to make a bad pun,
we should find something else for "woody."  From this, it looks like -XI from 
XILO should be used for "of wood."

        Another generic, hand-written in my dictionary, is -KO from KOMPANI,
and the example, also hand-written, is PUBLIKA-KO = publisher.

For those who do not have "Glosa 6000" I retype the 18 Generics in that
book, and use minimal page-width plus "dot" formatting:-

        18 Generic Terms
GENERIC.........MEANING........EXAMPLE........ENGLISH
-BO, BOteka.....shop...........pani-bo........baker's shop
-BO-PE..........shop-keeper....pani-bo-pe.....baker
-DO, DOmi.......house,building.agri-do........farm-house
-FA, FAski......set,bundle.....flori-fa.......bouquet
-FI, FIlament...thread.........kupra-fi.......copper wire
-KA, KAmera.....room...........kuko-ka........kitchen
-KO, KOmpani....business.......publika-ko.....publisher *[Added]
-LI, LItho......stone..........lamina-li......slate #[Old spelling]
-LO, LOka.......place..........panto-lo.......everywhere
-MA, MAteria....stuff,material.geo-ma.........mineral

-VA, VAsa.......container......soma-va........bath
-VE, VEsti......garment........pedi-ve........shoe,boot
-ZO, ZOna.......ring...........meso-zo........belt,girdle

        I will also send Paul photocopies of the "Interglossa" pages on
generics: Hogben had sixteen generics, one of which, -RE, is not included in
Glosa.  Perhaps  -RE = concerning  is too fuzzy for Glosa.
 --------------------------------------
        For another day: there could be a good case for having a separate
category of suffixes, four-letter ones, like -ISMO, to make
lexical items into various types of abstractions.

Saluta,
 Robin

Am sending you, Bill, the "Experimental Glosa Dictionaries" disk, but so far, 
have not found time to print the G-E double-sided, three-column dictionary.  I
hope you have time to print it yourself from the disk.  HINT for the
even-numbered pages, move the paper about half an inch to the right in the
printer.  Of course, the idea is that you print seventeen odd pages first,
then take the paper out of the printer, turn it over and print the
even-numbered pages on the reverse, making sure that Page 2 prints on the
reverse of page 1.
If you cannot get this done, I will print one, here, and send it.

The offer of an "Experimental Glosa dictionaries" disk is open to all, on
the Mail Forwarder, who wish to try their hand at writing Glosa.  As well as
the Glosa 6000 dictionary, I now use the G-E.ALL and E-G.ALL elecronic files
plus,
for further help, I use the Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary, the
Collins Gem Greek-English dictionary and the Reader's Digest "Word Finder."

On the help side, you will see the extensive \SYNONYMS  subdir. on the disk:
this needs altering before I print and send to Africa!  There are four
options that have been suggested:-

        A. Send the E-G file as it is, suitably compacted (3 col.,
dbl-sided), but this would be confusing to learners.  You and Paul would
probably object to this.
        B. Extensively revise the synonyms using a range of entries having
modifiers ... word(mildly) GLOSAWORD(S)1; word(in extreme) GLOSAWORD(S)2; etc.
This would take a lot of effort and involve serious dictionary research plus
a concensus between those doing it.  I would call this the "GLOSA 6000
Literary Dictionary" and it is not what we need at the moment.  This could
be produced in the future.
        C. The reduction of the entries to have only one synonym,
eliminating the rest of the possible synonyms.  How would you suggest
indicating the major word and the synonym, to be certain everyone knew which
was the preferred usage?
Paul B. has already said one synonym was one too many.  I prefer the
stylistic option of having the synonym, but must bow to the pragmatis of the
best presentation of the language for best results, EG water HIDRA,G._AQA.
        Originally it was AQA, but then Richmond preferred HIDRA, now I
treat this Greek word as my preferred usage.  How many people would write
off Glosa if water was always HIDRA without the option of using the
widely-known AQA?
        D. Use only one Glosa word for each English word listed: Paul says
this is the only way to reduce confusion (EG Someone uses AQA, and I use
HIDRA, and we think we are talking about different things.).  Ths
one_lexical_item_ per_ entry dictionary is what Paul prefers.  I would go
along with this ... leaving room in a small number of cases for one synonym
... It might be the "Kindergarten Glosa 6000" dictionary.  This would need
some agreement on which ONE was selected.  Please think about how you, Paul
and I could rapidly reach concensus on the single lexical item per entry.

*       If possible.  The G-E dictionary needs redoing to avoid have entries
out of alphabetic order .. before printing and sending out, widely.  how
easy would this be for you:-
        a. SORT alphabetically.
        b. Divide up into 180 entry chunks.
        c. Cut up to place two of the 60-entry bits to the right of the first
        (noting a twenty four, or twentyfive, character limit per entry) IE
x ->    x y z

*       As I see it, the Glosa authors a decade, or so, ago, adopted
Hogben's Generics with one deletion and three additions, and have left it
that way ever since.  All of their energies over the past ten years have
been in promotion of the language, with none put into extending or reviewing
the design of the language.  Personally, I believe that the language can be
extended and 'enriched' through a review of the design elements.  The
problem with this is that most of the learners have only "Glosa 1000", and
the rest have "Glosa 6000".
        The Glosa Central reasoning is probably geared to getting on with
the language, as published in 1992, and to avoid confusion with changes to
this '92
pattern.
        However, the Glosa Tense Table was developed after the publication
of Glosa 6000, and has circulated well enough.  An extended Generics list
can be circulated in a similar way.

    We know that this date is in the past, so 'pa' is completely
unnecessary here.  Many people have accused Glosa of being nothing more
than a direct replacement code for (relexification of) English.  This
sort of usage just confirms that accusation.  We have to avoid letting

trouble communicating with people who have other native language

    How do you speak a hyphen?  Many of us in western countries are so
used to dealing with written texts that we forget that language is
first and foremost a spoken/heard phenomenon, and not marks on a paper

Good point, Paul! I've fixed my reply-header.

Yes. As in "Yesterday we went" - well, we *know* it happened in the
past before we even get to the second word in that sentence, so why
worry about conjugation? Once we've established the time or the
subject(s), there's no reason to repeat that information.

As with "setimana" I feel that the hyphens will disappear from common
compounds. I dislike hyphens inside words. In English I rarely use them
except when I feel that they are absolutely necessary. And that necessity
is determined to a large extent by the familiarity of the word to both me
and the reader. And by our familiarity with the words which make up that
word. As I learn Glosa I find myself using hyphens much more frequently
than I normally do, and in fact *relying* upon them to help me parse
compound words. As I learn more, they won't be as helpful because then
I'll more quickly recognize the words that make up the compounds.

And this probably applies to Generics also. On Robin's pages I saw "redice"
and "re-dice". I prefer the look of "redice" and will undoubtedly spell it
that way. However, "re-dice" was immediately recognizable to me but "redice"
was not. So when I feel more comfortable with Glosa I'm sure that I'll soon
be applying that same writer/reader word familiarity rule.

It's late and I'm tired so I'm not going to look now but I must check my
notes to see if there is a standard rule covering these Glosa hyphens...

In the spoken language as in the written language, common compounds wouldn't
need a hyphen, but with compounds that are less common I bet the hyphen is
represented by a bit of a pause, and then a trailing "Know what I mean?"
kind of a look is appended to the word...

Synonyms

Suggested criteria for the selection of the "preferred" words:

1. The synonym which is used most often in common compounds should be
   the preferred word. Setimana argues for seti and mana rather than
   septi and matina.

2. For groups of logically related words, the preferred words should all
   come from the same language, for predictability.

3. Shorter words are probably better.   

4. The preferred word should not look or sound too much like some other
   totally unrelated word. This will probably be the trickiest criterion
   to apply!

5. For groups of logically related words, consider how the words might
   be used. For example, directions are often abbreviated, so Nord, Est,
   Sud, Uest are preferable to Boreo, Orienta, Austra, Ocide (which,
   however, make for wonderful literary synonyms!)

I can't wait to see that \SYNONYM directory! The first thing I plan to
do is write a little search program to implement that first criterion,
searching the lexicon for compounds...

   I tend to agree with you about Gaskell-Glosa and even, to some
extent, Aashby&Clark-Glosa (Ashby&Clark being the principals of Glosa). 
Even the latter, in some of their writings, tend to mark tense and
number either when it is already marked in some other or when it is
irrelevant.  There is a very small (and not overly active) discussion
group for Glosa (email me if you want to join), and twice recently I
have tried to point out overuse of markers.  Unsually I get either no
response at all or "Of course, but......."  Glosa does not *have* to
be just recoded English, but some users make it that way.  I sometimes
wonder if the Glosa-pe are their own worse enemies.

*       Point taken.  I will go along with the collective unconscious on this:
if 95% of the population cannot stand "overused" markers, then these
markers, when overused, are wrong.  Perhaps I am being pedantic or a
stickler for accuracy: either way, I am probably wrong.  There must be some
clear rules of thumb for deciding when a marker is necessary, when it is
redundant, and when it is optional.

*       No hyphens are not for sounding, just for the reader (and the
computer program).  Had seti-mana been hyphenated, Bill would have seen it
to be a compound, straight away.  Hyphens could be left out altogether, but
word derivation hints would be lost, and for those who are etymologicallyminded,
some of the interest in language would be lost.  Also, I am being pedantic,
again, in wishing to observe the "words-do-not-change-for-reasons-of-grammar"
rule.  As I see it, a compound with a hyphen in it is two words (neither
changing for grammar), while an unhyphenated compound is a new word.  This
is a different argument from the one for punctuation, which I consider to be
the indication of vocal change due to sentence structure.

    It seems clear enough to me.  If some other construct in a sentence
indicates something like time, plurality, or sex, then a marker is not
necessary.  Redundant grammatical markers do not do much harm, but they
are just that: redundant.  The problem is that if they are overused,
some people may come to regard them as necessary, which can lead to
confusion and misunderstanding of the spirit of the language.  It gives
rise to the accustion that Glosa really is an inflected language, which
it is not.

Subject: Experimental Dictionaries
To: Robin Gaskell
Date: Tue, 14 Oct 97 20:1

Hi Robin!

I received the Experimental Dictionaries disk today.

I've printed out the G-E dictionary. Tried printing from DOS first but
(due to printer setup probably) some bottom lines were getting shoved
to the following pages. So I jumped into Windows and used the Works word
processor, with size 10 Courier New font and .75 inch top and bottom
margins.

But I noticed that each formfeed in the PRT*.* files was followed by
two blank lines, so the first page of the file prints ok but subsequent
pages are too long. Maybe that was the problem. And GALAXY appears to
append two CTRL-Z characters to the end of the file, sort of in the old
CPM or DOS fashion. I wonder if it *requires* them? If so, I'll have
to remember to append them to files I send to you!

I skimmed over the pages as they printed and noticed some synonym problems.
I see you've already got LISO in the synonyms directory. TITO is another
one: "kind of owl" or "small, young". Well, those aren't really synonyms -
I forget the word for what they are - words that are the same but have
different meanings!

And "vanish" appears as EVANESCE, VANESKE, and VANESCE.

And "bigamy" appears as BI-GAMI. A typo, perhaps? Since elsewhere GAME
is the marriage word. (That was in the E-G.ALL).

I was tickled by the fact that "big breasts" have their own word: BUMASTA.
But is that singular or plural? Should be singular? I would like to assume
that all Glosa things are singular unless plued, so to say.

E-G.ALL & G-E.ALL will be very handy. L6 turns out to be version 6.2a of
Buerg's LIST program. I use that all the time! I've got version 7.6a. It's
a bit larger than L6. One nice feature is that if you just enter LIST, it
brings up a directory listing, and you can navigate the directories and
select the file to read. There's also a newer version out there in the
universe somewhere - I tried it, but preferred this version, though I don't
remember why. I think because it had too many fancy features than I didn't
want in a lister program.

I hope to get back to "Un Lupus" soon. I've just been too busy. And now
I'm anxious to dig into these synonyms. Well, this is how I learn best!

Subject: Synonyms & Relexifications
To: William
Date: Thu, 16 Oct 97 22:4


Just a few thoughts off the top of my (aching!) head.
(I've had a nasty headcold these past few days.)

I haven't examined the synonym files yet, but I did print the Glosa-
English dictionary and begin reading through it. There seem to be
many synonyms in there, which is probably proper for a Glosa-natlang
dictionary, though in a natlang-Glosa dictionary we should have one
preferred word, marked as such (or the assumption that the first
synonym is the preferred word (and for clarity one should stick to
it!). Even then, though, is it necessary to have seven words for
"food"? And four words for "five"? Perhaps in Literary Glosa?

As a slightly tangential comment, I want to repeat that I *like*
synonyms and antonyms. This is one thing that I like about Ido in
comparison to Esperanto, though I have much more experience with
Esperanto. Few synonyms and no antonyms makes for easier learning,
but also gets boring after a while. And sometimes ugly. So I was
amused and pleased to find that many of my favorite "literary"
Esperanto words achieved perfect respectability in Ido, even as Ido
retains the ability to construct antonyms by use of a prefix, useful
when one knows only one member of an antonymic pair, and isn't able
for whatever reason to look up the other; though I'm not sure it's
considered good form, it would certainly be understandable.

Anyway, back to Glosa. I've found what appear to be relexifications
(don't get me wrong! I also feel that a little relex isn't always
bad!) of English forms of Latin phrases. "Ad lib" from English "ad
lib" from Latin "ad libitum", for example. It's not the relex which
bothers me; it's the fact that there appears to be no Glosa word
"lib". Now, since "ad libitum" means "at pleasure", I'd suggest that
we use "ad hedo" for this concept; or perhaps just remove the space
and coin a new word "adlib" - I prefer "ad hedo". Or perhaps
"ad-hedo" or "adhedo". Or does that make it a relex of Latin?

Another is "ad hok", when Glosa has no "hok". And "ad rem" when there
is no Glosa word "rem"? Though I'm not familiar with the phrase "ab
ovo" (from the start), there appears to be no Glosa word "ovo"; but
there is "ova" (egg) and I rather like the translation of "ab ova",
which would be "from the egg". Or is one of those ov- words a typo?
Or is this one of those terminal inconsistencies that Paul mentioned?

And now, the goats. I can accept two words for goat: "aegi" and
"kapri". But first I question the -i in "aegi", since the Greek word
is "aego". Second, "aegialo" (shore) follows "aegi" in the dictionary
and since both "aegi" and "alo" (or, alternative) *are* Glosa words,
one might assume (if not knowing better) that "aegi" and "aegialo"
are somehow related. Goat alternatives, anybody?

And thirdly, why isn't a "kaprimulgus" (goat - kid) a "kapri-fili"?

Sadisti: hunter, sadist. This may be a problem for some people!

And my setimana! This dictionary contains no "seti" but it does add
"hepta". And my "mana" has been replaced by "di", giving "septi-di"!
Seven-days - just doesn't seem as lyrical to me as seven-mornings.

Are we creating Fili, the Glosa equivalent of Esperanto's Ido?
Or is Glosa already the Fili, being the child of Interglossa?
How does one say "grandchild" in Glosa?

Another tangent: when the computer language C++ was named there was
some argument as to whether it should be called D or P. You see, BCPL
begat B, and B begat C. The question was, should the name of the next
language be determined alphabetically, or once again by the BCPL

My first thought, after laughing at this joke, was:
This is something which would *not* translate well into most IALs.

========

Once Mr. D gets an oppurtunity to fly to a near by country. Mr. D
never has been on an airplane anywhere and has got so excited and
tensed.

As soon as he boarded the plane, a BOEING 747, he started jumping in
excitement, running over seat to seat and starts shouting 'BOEING!
BOEING!! BOEING!!! BO....'.

He forgets what's around, even the pilot in the cock-pit hears the
noise. Annoyed by the sound, the Pilot comes out and shouts 'BE
SILENT!'. There was pin-drop silence every where and everybody is
looking at the Mr. D and the angry Pilot. Mr. D stared at the Pilot
in silence for a moment and all of a sudden started shouting, 'OEING!
OEING!! OEING!!! OE...'.

Hello to all on the Glosa Mail Forwarder,
        This message from John Schilke clears up the mystery of his sudden
disappearance from our discussions.  John will definitely appreciate hearing
from as many of us as possible!

        John, I hope you get this message, I missed getting your cheery
mail.  I hope you will be fully up and running very soon.

Organisational: It looks as if the original Glosalist address has been
replaced by the Majordomo one, by my ISP.  I must do some hard study soon to
find out what I have to do to get the Glosalist working through Majordomo.

Saluta,

Possibly the MISSING.E-G file will turn up in your e-mail reader

try to insinuate it into Eudora's Mailbox, and treat it as a mailbox item,

        Re synonyms, I think a decision must be made for the learner's First
Glosa dictionary.  I, too, like synonyms - though am not necessarily so keen
on antonyms - and found the Glosa 1000 too stifling, altogether.  I would
say that one major Glosa word, with only one synonym, where it seemed
`popular', might be 
a rule of thumb for whittling down the E-G.ALL to an acceptable form.

        A "Middle 6000" with two or, at most, three, synonyms could follow.
However, I feel that some explanatory adjective or adverb would probably help -
as suggested by Paul Bartlett.  The "Literary 6000", with all possible synonyms,
is outside my range of language knowlege, and of very limited projected use.
Again, I think that clarification of the synonyms would be necessary .. to
differentiate between their nuances of meaning.

Saluta, 
 Robin
PS Glad you are enjoying the Glosa Vocab conundrum.  I looked briefly at the
Auxlang strand on reaching agreement on featurea of a Global IAL, and it
does not look good.  Paul B. suggests that, taking the non-European conlangs
into account, there is not really any concensus reachable.  I lack the
mental capacity to study all of the possible languages, but can look into
one quite deeply, hence my working with Glosa, which I still think is the
"elegant" model. R.

This *is* interesting. E-G.ALL and G-E.ALL have only one trailing CTRL-Z,
but INFO.TXT and LET_TO.WWP have two! Anyway, that's the old CP/M and
early DOS style, using CTRL-Z to mark the end-of-file. Newer programs
don't care whether it's there or not. Though some programs, both old and
new, will stop reading when they hit a CTRL-Z, even if it's in the middle
of a file.

GALAXY doesn't seem to mind if the input file has no trailing CTRL-Z. I
created a file without CTRL-Z and opened it in GALAXY. Worked OK. And
when I saved it, GALAXY appended two CTRL-Zs. But it does stop reading if
I stuff a CTRL-Z into the middle of a file. No big deal, because that's
something one has to do on purpose - it won't happen under normal
circumstances.

Subject: Dictionaries
To: William
Date: Thu, 30 Oct 97 21:4

Beginning with G-E.ALL, I wrote an awk script to create GE0.TXT,
which consists of lines of the form "glosaword = englishword", one
word from each language per line. Then I re-sorted, and then used vim
and uniq to pull out the lines that begin with the same Glosa words.
The purpose was to locate (as much as possible!) all those Glosa
words which appear to have multiple meanings; not just similar
meanings (synonyms), but completely different meanings. For example,
I found that "amo" means "like", "love" and "sand", and "hipo" means
"below", "under" and "horse". Some of these result from a Greek word
clashing with a Latin word. Some may be typos. But I'd like to clean
them up before I continue.

I'm currently looking at 274 such words. Here's an example of a
fairly simple situation:
   KANCERA = cancer - crab
   KARCINO = cancer - crab
   KARCINOMA = cancerous ulcer
For internal consistency of the dictionary, here are my choices:
   KANCERA = crab
   KARCINO = cancer
   KARCINOMA = cancerous ulcer

And another:
   TIRO = beginner - cheese (!)
   TYRO = beginner
   KASEA = cheese
Here are my choices:
   KASEA = cheese
   TIRO = beginner
I chose TIRO rather than TYRO because the Glosa Basic Reference says
that the "y" in Greek words should be replaced by "i".

Qestio: Should TIRO instead be considered literary? A synonym? Maybe
we should instead construct "beginner" using the "-pe" Generic. We'd
have to choose our rootword carefully. Would a beginning-person be a
novice or a baby? Another example, we find:
   MANTI = divination - soothsayer
and I'm wondering if we should have MANTI = "divination" and MANTI-PE
for soothsayer.

Which brings to mind another criterion for synonym selection: a
synonym which spawns a Generic should be the Primary! Of course, only
a few words could possibly be affected by this. Maybe none. But it's
pretty important, I think.

Plus questio: GOMFO represents bolt, nail and peg, but sometimes I
think we'd need to be more specific as to which one we really should
be using. Any suggestions? The Glosa dictionary contains several
words for nail, but they all seem to be the biological kind, except
maybe for one that I don't recognize: what sort of nail is an AKU?

Once we've got these multiple-meaning words nailed down, I plan to
invert the file and consolidate the synonym lines to form a literary
English-Glosa dictionary. Then we can select a primary synonym for
each English word, resulting in the basic English-Glosa dictionary.

So I envision three dictionaries:
   a glosa-natlang dictionary containing all the words
   a literary natlang-glosa dictionary containing all the words
   a basic natlang-glosa dictionary containing only primary synonyms
Of course, the literary dictionary could also function as a basic
dictionary if we assume that the first synonym is the primary.   

Has anybody else noticed that the creators of Glosa seemed to be
awfully fond of bogs and marshes and mud and and pipes and other such
watery things, and suet and fat and grease, too?

        The word, "homonym" covers words with the same spelling but different,

        It is my belief that we cannot afford the luxury of unnecessary, and
definitely confusing, synonyms in a language that is presented as
streamlined, with primarily one word per concept.

*       For consistency, the use of category markers, such as -PE give Glosa
part of its distinctive feel, and would be the better choice.  TIRO = cheese
can be kept *in the wings* for literary use, when Glosa has a body of users,
but, for the present we are liable to *drown the baby by overfilling the
bath* to bend a cliche.
        Lexical distinctions, like one between the soothsayer and his
prognostications, are essential if Glosa is to be fully flexible.  The
mechanism is there: you have used it correctly, Bill.  I ask for others on
the Mail Forwarder to give their opinions!?  We can also use MANTI-AN and
MANTI-FE if we need to specify the sex of the diviner.  I would say that
when the Glosa authors were working on the lexicon, they were concentrating
on the *large picture*, and thus, got the job completed; now it is necessary
for us to see that the *detail* has been filled in correctly (or consistently).

*       Agreed: this principle is sound.  For example, is a water-pipe an
AQA-TUBI or a HIDRA-TUBI?  Which 'primary' lends itself better, and "feels"
better, when used to form 'generics'?  AQA-TUBI rolls off the tongue better,
and, by such backward logic, AQA should probably be the 'primary' Glosa-word 
for water.

>
*       Again, such differentiation of meaning is essential.  A "bolt" is
blunt, but anything called an AKU = "needle", "nail" ( from AKUTO = sharpen)
must be
sharp and pointed.  Perhaps when sewing, we use a VE-AKU, and when doing
carpentry, we use a XY-AKU.  When clothiers are talking together, they say
AKU, knowing they are only referring to the sewing needle; while, when
carpenters discus the job they only use AKU, knowing it is a "nail".
        The Langenscheidt Shorter Latin Dictionary didn't help much:-
  L-E  gomphus, i - peg, pin.

  E-L  peg - clavus  [L-E  clavus - 1. nail; 2. a) rudder, helm; b) purple
stripe on tunic.]
        pin - acus, us; fibula  [L-E  acus - needle.]

        This world standard dictionary has the same sort of *mulberry bush*
meanings that people criticise in "Glosa 6000".  With more time and
patience, I would look further to differentiate between "pins" and "needles".
        In the end, I try to assemble all of the possible Classical words
with their meanings, and try to distil the original flavour ... or sound
particle ...
that gave each word its conceptual meaning.  This method has been used by
the Glosa authors e.g. PET = fly
        The whole thing is complicated by the fact that the Ancients used
wooden pegs to hold things together, because the technology of nuts and
bolts was not available to them.  So, maybe the modern bolt is a renovation
of the old "peg".
This might give us the Glosa-word GOMFO = bolt .. or, if a bolt is really a 
"screw-peg", HELIKO-GO = screw-peg (bolt).  Maybe the modern "pin" is a
GOMFO in Glosa.

cases where a synonym is assumed, e.g. AQA (HIDRA) or is it HIDRA (AQA) ?

*       Well, landform and water were very important to the Ancients, who
lived much closer to the elements than we do.  I guess this comes through in
what we know of their culture and language.  Whenever I do dictionary
research in "6000"
I see the mists and rolling hills of ancient Greece, and I am reminded of
what passed for civilisation, in those days, in Rome and Athens.  The
contrast is marked when comparing the Greek and Latin dictionaries: in the
Greek dictionary there are modern figures of speech and contemporary
inventions; the Latin dictionary seems frozen in time - in a pre-industrial
earth-bound culture.
        This flavour has come across in "6000", with words for pine-cones
and pine trees, but nothing for "pins".  I wonder, were pine-needles the
first pins, or did the Ancients use bones from small animals or fish, as
their first sewing pins!
        Perhaps what happened then is just not relevent, now, and all we
have to do is find suitable words - or families of words - that allow us to
differentiate between the different technological concepts available to us
to-day.

    Robin, I must very strongly disagree with you here.  What "feels"
better or "rolls off the tongue better" is so subjective and influenced
by prior conditioning as to be a useless criterion, in my humble
opinion.  The feel and pronounceability are going to be so determined
by one's previous linguistic experience that nobody will agree.  I
suggest this criterion be dropped.

> *        In the same way that Ron and Wendy stressed the value of the "Glosa
> 1000" dictionary for learners,

    Unfortunately, no consistent list of "Glosa 1000" exists, as I
found out when I collated official copies from G.E.O.  That's why the
Glosa Basic Reference on the Web pages has more on the order of 1600
words than 1000.  Regardless of whatever the personal and
circumstantial limitations of Ashby&Clark may have been and/or be, this
lack of consistency (as well as in terminal vowels and two Glosa words
for a term) is harmful to the Glosa cause.  People may never know or
care about Ashby&Clark and their personal circumstances: they will only
know the publications, which could have been better done, no matter
_how_ they came to be the way they are.

I'm using DOS versions of these handy Unix programs.

Awk is a programming language that allows you to write programs which
read textfiles one line at a time, find the lines which match some
criterion, then perform some function on those lines. You could do the
same thing in pretty much any language but awk was designed for this
sort of textprocessing so it has lots of useful functions that make the
tasks much easier. Vim is an editor, a freeware superduper version of
Unix vi (vim = vi-improved). Uniq reads a file and writes out any
duplicate adjacent lines. Or you can tell it to write out the lines
which are not duplicated. Grep, fgrep and egrep are like the DOS find,
but with more features.

So, for example, once I had the file of glosaword=englishword records,
I used vim to globally delete everything after the = and then saved
this as a new file, containing only Glosa words. Then I passed this
file to uniq and it returned a file consisting of only the duplicated
Glosa words. Then I wrote an awk program to search the Glosa dictionary
for every word in the duplicates file, writing those words and definitions
to another file. Then I used vim to read that file and remove the
duplicates which were just synonyms, leaving only those duplicate words
with different meanings.

Yes! I had a similar feeling when I first examined the Generics; not
ancient, just not quite modern. That's what prompted my earlier question
about the Generics - the choices seemed odd, but intriguing.

The feeling does get stronger and more ancient as I examine the dictionary.

Unfortunately (or not, depending on one's point of view), as an IAL Glosa
will undoubtedly acquire more modern words, or develop its own substitute
terms for modern concepts. But I can't help liking a language that has
seven words for "marsh", and another for "marsh marigold". I think I'll
add a fourth dictionary to my list, by freezing a copy of the first
literary dictionary, and calling it Classical Glosa.

But I'd argue that in a living language the "feel" would be very important
in unconsciously deciding between two words which are otherwise equivalent.
And though the engineer in me prefers HIDRO (hydraulic, etc.), most of me
does prefer AQA. Since both appear only once in compounds, I feel that this
is a case in which "feel" could be a valid consideration.

Besides, the HIDRO compound is just ANHIDRO (without water), but the AQA
compound is AQARELA (water color) and to me that seems to be of more
significance than the simple negation embodied in the former.

What color is your water?

    Again I want to stress how much this "feel" is strongly biased by
prior conditioning.  If Glosa ever takes off, a lot of learners are
going to be post-adolescents whose language habits are more or less
fixed.  And for that matter, even pre-adolescent children can have a
certain amount of fixity (though less) in their language habits.

    English is basically a Germanic language, and the Germanic and
Slavic languages are notorious for their consonant clusters, which can
be a real struggle for adult learners from other language groups.  I
once worked with refugees whose native language was Khmer, and they had
a devil of a time with the consonant clusters of English.  If they were
assessing different candidate Glosa words, they might
semi-automatically select the one with fewer consonant clusters on the
grounds that it "feels" better, whereas an anglophone or slavophone,
accustomed to consonant clusters, might not even think of such a matter
with regard to how a word "feels."

    My whole point is that we can be led badly astray by our prior
language conditioning as to what "feels" better or "natural."  This
subjectivity has been notorious in the constructed auxliliary language
world.  "Natural" and "feels" better are all too often code words for
"more like my native language."  Other people with native languages
from different language fanilies might think that very different
phenomena "feel" better and more "natural."

    I still maintain that "feel" is so subjective and deceptive as to
be useless in practice.  If you think that you _must_ use it, then by
all means gather a panel of Glosa-pe who have different native
languages from English, preferably those with non-Indo-European native
tongues, and see how much agreement there is on "feel."

{crossposted to AUXLANG, Glosa Discussion

    Some time ago I received a private communication from George
Boeree, the originator of Lingua Franca Nova, from which I will take
the liberty to quote a few lines here.

    I have sometimes wondered what is the justification for the
sometime assumption that a strictly isolating language, say of the
Glosa type, is necessarily "simpler" than a language more of the
agglutinating type, such as Esperanto.  _Why_ must a welter of
particles with otherwise invariant roots somehow _have_ to be "simpler"
than agglutinated morphemes?  What does it even mean to say that one
structural type is "simpler" than another?

    What is a good working vocabulary size for a conIAL, even if we
allow for word derivation from roots?  About how many words do people
need to express more or less what they want to express in everyday
living (apart from specialized, vocational, literary, or technical
terminology)?  Mr. Boeree hypothesizes about 3000 - 4000.  Other 
ideas?

Subject: Hunters/Sadists & Fingers/Toes
To: William
Date: Tue, 11 Nov 97 01:1

Perhaps the creators were trying to make a statement - I don't know.
But here's how I've resolved the SADISTI homonym. Originally, we had...

   CASA = chase, hunt
   SADI = cruel
   SADISTI = hunter - sadist

Now we have...

   CASA = chase, hunt
   SADI = cruel
   SADISTI = sadistic (as in Glosa 1000)
   CASA-PE = hunter
   SADISTI-PE = sadist

I've noticed that there are several words in Glosa 6000 which refer
to people, and end in -STI, and appear to be formed from a root word:
SADI -> SADISTI, DENTI -> DENTISTI, JURNALI -> JURNALISTI, for examples.
Taking a clue from Glosa 1000, I removed the person from SADISTI but
retained the word as a different form of cruelty. There are undoubtedly
other words like this. For words like the other examples, I'd suggest
that we drop the -STI words: DENTI -> DENTI-PE, JURNALI -> JURNALI-PE.

========

DIGITA is a word that looked like a homonym though it isn't really.
DAKTILI probably should have looked like a homonym even though it
isn't, but it didn't, because it was defined only as finger.

We had...

   DAKTILI,G. = finger
   DIGITA = finger - toe
   MANU = hand
   PEDI = foot
   POLEX = thumb
   HALUX = big toe

According to my dictionaries it appears that neither Greek nor Latin
distinguished between the digits of the hands and feet, though somebody
found words for thumb and big toe! In fact, my Greek dictionary refers
to "finger" as "daktilo" and "toe" as "daktilo of the foot".

So we have...

   DAKTILI,G. = digit(finger or toe)
   DIGITA = digit(finger or toe)
   MANU-DIGITA = finger
   PEDI-DIGITA = toe
   POLEX = thumb
   HALUX = big toe

Unless somebody perhaps has a better dictionary, one which gives separate
words for "finger" and "toe"? I still find it hard to believe that neither
of those two languages distinguishes between them!

*       I have not looked at the lists of spring/stream/fountain words, but
I do not agree that we are able to arbitrarily allocate our chosen meanings
to existing lexical items.
 1) I go along with the Huna idea that words are made up of elements that
have 'spiritual' significance.  If we were able to look back far enough, we
would find the primitive start of language, and we would probably find that
the elements of 'watery flowingness' are in NASMA.  I suspect that the "AS"
in NASMA is suggestive of flowing water; the whole word gives me the mental
picture of a wet patch at the bottom of a hill, where the ground-water is
oozing out into a boggy area from which a small rill of flowing water runs
away into a larger riverlet, and so on.
        A bit poetic, I guess, and very subjective, but the original word
had to come from somewhere, and did have a specific meaning, then.  I would
like to imagine that someone with perceptive powers could sit down with the
various synonimous words on his desk with a few Classical dictionaries for
research, and then could fill in the presently significant concepts of
'watery flowingness' - matching up the Classical lexical entries with
current concepts.  
 2) I have to admit that PIDAKO seems like a much more acive word, probably
covering water in the form of an actual squirt.  Is the "AKO" element
suggestive of water 'arcing' in the form of an arch, or is it to do with
pointedness [ref. "aku"], and thus something to do with water from a
fountain or a spring that is spirting water.  In England, there is a small
group of villages that feature the word "Piddle" (= stream) as part of their
name, e.g. Piddle Trenthide.  Maybe a PIDAKO is the water squirt that comes
from a wet rock stratum forming the start of a river.
        Again, poetic ... but not arbitrary, though possibly intuitive.
 ... I hope that this helps in the search for meaning.  I can hear Paul Bartlett
disapproving of this approach as too subjective, but I believe that it is
'intuitve.'

*       I understand, Paul, that my "feeling" is likely to be different from
that of others growing up with other sounds and other neuro-muscular traces
built up in the formation of these sounds.  However, I am trying to be  -
the impossible - impartial, in this.  I am thinking ~Glosa~ and I am
thinking ~elegance~ in sound.  Worse, I am assuming the Roman alphabet: this
is an incorrect assumption for the Chinese people who do not differentiate
between 
/l/, /n/ and /r/.
        But where do we draw the line?  Can we only use one of this trio of
phonemes because, otherwise, many Chinese speakers would have to learn how
to form the new sounds?  That cuts the effective alphabet down to
twenty-four; through a similar process of reduction, reviewing other
languages, how many letters would we be left with?   This leads to the
Gilson (AUXLANG) suggestion that a Global IAL is an impossibility.
        My refutation of this is that LUI Haitao, of China, taught himself
Esperanto, and subsequently Glosa, in which he was quite good, but ... his
attempts at English were atrocious!  Agreed this was in the written form only!!!
        Haitao is now on Auxlang.  Perhaps I should ask him to re-open our
dialogue .. but with the use of voice cassettes to demonstrate his ability
to sound both Esperanto and Glosa.  I would like to know how well his vocal
attempts at the auxiliary languages matches up with his spoken use of them.

*       I would agree with the Khymer speakers: what rolls off the tongue
best is the obvious choice.  And it is true, Glosa started with the  C-V-C-V
pattern.  Some of the later additions .. more the Greek ones .. are a bit
hader to articulate.  Which would be harder for a Khymer to say: AQA or HIDRA?
        Consonant clusters are bad news, and should not be in Glosa.  But I
probably (PROBABILI) accepted them without thinking, because they were no
trouble to me.  Point taken.  I still wonder, though, if the Classical roots
of science can somehow be taken as a baseline in international vocabulary.
Somewhere a decision would have to be made .. along the lines of the need
for sufficient concepts.  Also, some smoothing of sounds could occur, as in
the case of PROBABILI, above.  The consistency of using the Classicals of
science is a factor in the equation, as well.
        Who has to compromise what - if global dialogue is to take place:
the Chinese and others with the learning of new sounds; or those for whom
the Classicals are comfortable .. in the loss of words or the alteration of
spellings, for ease of pronunciation?

    Not necessarily.  In the 1950's, a Vietnamese author came out with
the auxlang project FRATER.  He explicitly named Bodmer as a source of
ideas, although I suspect they were actually based somewhat on those of
Hogben as expressed in _The_Loom_of_Language_.  I developed and
modified FRATER into my frater2 project, although I have never gotten
vocabulary typed in, so it has been largely an exercise in structure. 
Information on frater2 is available via my auxlang WWW page at

http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/6223/

    My whole point is that the sound system of FRATER (which I did not
change in frater2) consists of only eighteen (count 'em) phonemes. 
>From what I have been able to tell, these eighteen are among the most
common phonemes in the world's languages.  As in Glosa, most of the
base vocabulary is taken from Latin and Greek roots, but because of the
limited phoneme inventory, a goodly number of them have undergone some
deformation.  Apparently there was a conscious design decision to place
pronounceability for more above strict recognizability for some. 
FRATER showed that is is completely possible to build an auxlang out of
a limited phoneme inventory.

    Granted, Glosa could not withstand such a severe reduction of
phoneme inventory without losing its character.  But a reduced
inventory does not at all mean an auxlang is thereby impossible.  From
his posts on the AUXLANG list, I suspect that Bruce Gilson's idea that
a truly global conIAL is not possible does not derive from phoneme
inventory.

Ave, panto-pe!

With all those gloomy watery places waiting for us you'd think that
Glosa would provide us with some decent footwear, but all we've got
is...

BOTA = boot              
TROKADA = running shoe     Greek trokadin = at a run, quickly
SOKO = shoe(light)         Latin soccus = light shoe; comedy
UDO = shoe - sock          Latin udo = shoe of felt or skin

Well, ok, the boot would be handy.

BOTA is ok - I think we can leave that one alone. TROKADA's ok too,
though I bet *that* wasn't in Classical Glosa. But what I'm looking
for here is just some plain old shoes and socks. My English bias
tells me to use SOKO for sock, leaving UDO for shoe, but the
etymologies tell me to do the opposite: Latin "udo" sounds more
socklike, and "soccus" is definitely a shoe. (Or a comedy?)

How about some new terms?

I rather like the Latin word for stocking: "tibiale". (The Greek
"kaltda" is too close in sound to KALTA (marsh marigold)).

For shoe, Latin "calceus" works for me - say it out loud, it sounds
better than it looks. KALCEUS. Then there's the Greek "papoutdi" -
but I think that one looks better than it sounds.

And we could then leave UDO as it is, meaning either shoe or sock,
generically footwear. Or maybe yesterday's UDO *is* today's sock.
Kind of an inner, soft shoe.

*       This sort of rationalisation seems necessary to 'standardise' Glosa
forms.  Obviously, for the lexicon, we need different words for 'cruelty'
and 'sadism'.  Here I suggest the noun as the base "concept word".  Both
"cruel" and "sadistic", as you have given them, are adjectives: I imagine
the mind storing its collection of concepts as either objects or actions; so
getting mixed up with psycho-linguistics, I see most of our mental store of
concepts as either nouns or verbs.  EG the Glosa word, KI, is most likely
stored mentally as the action, and not as (in English) "going" - the
gerundive form.  IE KI (= to go)
would seem the base concept, rather than U KI (=the going) or DU KI (=going:
continuous action).

        The example SADISTI, however, meaning 'causing cruelty', is very
likely stored in our memory banks as a description .. so the adjective
"sadistic" might be the entry in our mental lexicon, because using this
concept decriptively is more basic than thinking of the abstract idea,
"sadism."  More by coincidence, I suspect, the -STI suffix can mean
"causing" or "causes."  So SADI-STI or SADISTI
could be ~glossed~ as <cruelty causing>.  Thus, SADI-STI-PE, or SADISTI-PE,
glosses well as <cruelty causing person>.

*       And again the -ISTI could be a "switch on" suffix.  The -I- might
just be the terminal vowel, leaving the -STI part to refer to the "switching
on" or "causing to come into being."  A JURNALI-PE causes the JURNALI to
come into being, so might legitemately be a JURNALI-STI, or a JURNALISTI.
Dentists, on the other hand, cause dentures, or bring them into being.
Whether all this was going on in the Clark/Ashby brain at the time of
vocabulary-building, I don't know, but there could have been some
serendipitous thinking occurring.

        Such inconsistencies are, I feel, par for the course.  The Glosa
authors did a very large job in hunting out their 6000 concept wordlist; and
while some of us might question some of the inclusions and omissions, the
rationalisations you suggest are legitemate at this Applications Research
stage of the language's development.  Perhaps suggestions for the inclusion
of additional words, EG computing terminologogy and some descriptive
linguistic terms, plus a hit list for removals - from "6000" - are also in
order at this 'Applications' stage of Glosa's development.

*       Missing from the "6000" list is the obvious choice, the generic,
PEDI-VE.  But, then again, is ~foot-clothing~ a shoe or a sock?  Obviously,
in taking the overview of all knowlege, we, in Glosa, ranged our eyes over

PEDI-VE.

        For wet weather, we no doubt have PLU PLUVI-SOKO or PLUVI-PEDI-VE;
and for really muddy places, we would put on our PLU PLUVI-BOTA, probably
rubber Wellington boots.

    Why the specification of plurality in the use of a general term?  I
consider it unnecessary.  This seems to me to be merely native speech
habits creeping in, lending further credence that Glosa is nothing more
than recoded English.  In that case, why not junk Glosa and just have
everybody learn English?

    I definitely agree here.  I think there should be avoidance of
multiplication of vocabulary beyond what is necessary.  That is why 
I do not necessarily advocate use of "Glosa 6000" but suggested
consideration of a few more generics to allow further word-building
without undue expansion of the root word stock.

    If Majordomo is ready to go, I can just email you the list of the
addresses current members of the discussion group, on the presumption
that they would want to continue.  How you would get them into
Majordomo I do not know, as I am unfamiliar with it.  Then you would
have to make an announcement as to change of address people should make
for new postings.  In the meantime, I could probably forward any
resudual postings coming to the old address to the new group.  Also, it
would only take me a few minutes to change the text on the GlLosa web
pages.

"Mi kanta." as a *complete* sentence would have to mean "I sing.",
since the alternative would not be a complete sentence.

As *part* of a sentence, the meaning would depend on the rest of the
sentence. In a well-formed Glosa sentence I'd expect all the pieces
to support each other in such a way that no ambiguity would exist.
Context. Many Glosa words can serve in more than one part-of-speech
role, with the part-of-speech in a particular sentence being determined
by the word's position in that sentence. If "mi kanta" is taken as a
sentence fragment, we don't know the position that it had in the original
sentence, so we can't say one way or the other what part of speech it was.

I wonder if setting an increased word count goal (Glosa 6000) is the best
guide for improving "expressiveness", since it might be at the expense of
requiring increased memorization. For any new proposed word, do you make a
point of identifying the closest existing compound word that approximates
the same meaning to help you judge whether creation of a brand new word is
justified?

Compound words can be tricky. I recall one language, or maybe just a
hypothetical example, which referred to some small fruit, *not* a grape,
as a "purple-berry"; a grape was a "wine-berry". Wine-berry would be
recognizable by a member of a culture that does wine, but not by a person
who doesn't know wine; either way, a purple-berry could easily be taken
for grape. One must consider the culture, or in Glosa's case, many cultures,
and form words appropriately. I think a good approach would be to expand
the vocabulary for the sake of precision, but to allow users to form
compounds (at their own risk, perhaps) as needed if they don't know the
Glosa word, or if Glosa doesn't have an appropriate word. And for Glosa
to include the compounds when recognizability is highly probable.

Yep, I'd say that a PEDI-VE would be comparable to the English SHOE - the
primary footwear in a culture. Anything alse to be worn on the foot would
need further qualification; and the other words can be synonyms, or
literary.

I think that the lexicon will certainly change with time and become less
classical; but the Classic Glosa will always be sitting there in the
background!

Now... a request! I have very few Glosa oneliners in my random .signature
generator - a lot of English, much Esperanto, some Ido and Interlingua,
and a sprinking of other languages. But little Glosa as yet. That's why
the .sig below is probably going to be in English or Esperanto. The request
is this: please submit Glosa translations of your favorite oneliners to
the list so that I can enhance my .sigfile! TIA!

The conlang AllNoun was designed to have only one part of speech, the noun.
A strange but interesting idea. But I couldn't find much about it at that
time. In some ways it appeared to be similar to Glosa, but in addition it
uses particles to convey verbal ideas. I also tend to think that the
Universe requires at least verbs and nouns, actions and things to do the
acting and be acted upon, and that this pair may also be sufficient. But if
I try real hard I can almost see these as One and the Same.

Well done! - I see that you fixed this in the printable Glosa-English
dictionary! But in the original files, if you look up FINGER you find
DIGITA, and if you look up TOE, you also find DIGITA, and neither mentions
the other. Thus we seem to have a homonym, but we don't really - it's just
that DIGITA is more inclusive than the dictionary indicates if you only
happen to look up one of the terms.

*       Bene-venu Andy,
Glosa is planned - for better or worse - to be a language in which the words
are concept-centres.  It could thus be a "metalanguage" or one of the latest
trends in the evolution of language.  

        English:- ................... Glosa:-
        I, me, my, mine ............. mi
        sing, sings, song, singing .. kanta
        You guessed it: MI KANTA is both "I sing" and "my singing"; it is also 
"my song," and if you push it, "me sing[?]".

        Some languages have complicated inflection systems to indicate their
grammar: of the national languages English has a minimal inflectional system;
I am jumped upon when I say that Chinese lacks inflections altogether (but
it still seems to be true, anyway); and Glosa has words that do not change
for reasons of grammar.

        In Glosa, as in 50% of English, the grammar is all in the syntax!
 "Dog bites man." = U KANIS MORDA UN ANDRA. 
 "Man bites dog." = UN ANDRA MORDA U KANIS.

        Back to the song:-
 "I sing when I am happy."  MI KANTA KRON MI HABE HEDO. [.. have happiness.]
 "The bird replied to my singing."  UN AVI PA RESPONDE A MI KANTA.
 "My singing is too loud."  MI KANTA HABE TRO SONO [ .. has too much sound.]
 "When I sing, the whole world listens."  KRON MI KANTA, U HOLO MUNDA AKUSTI.
 "Will I sing now?"  QE, MI NU KANTA?
 "What: me sing?"  QOD: MI KANTA?
 "My song was from the heart"  MI KANTA PA VENI EX U KADIA. [ .. did come .. ]
 "The singing you heard was mine." U KANTA; TU PA AUDI PA ES MI.[did be mine.]
  ............................................................. [.. was me.]

 "I sing my song."  !!!!!!!!!  _not_  MI KANTA MI KANTA.
  ........................... _more_  MI VOCA MI KANTA.  [ .. voiced .. ]
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 On the Glosa discussion group, we are using the kindness of Paul Bartlett's 
Mail Forwarder.  By now, Paul will have added your e-address to his
Forwarder list, and anything you send to     glosa <pobart{at}access{dot}digex{dot}net>
will be forwarded to all of us on that list.

 My ISP has installed Majordomo, and soon we will get the Glosalist back
with my ISP, thanking Paul for giving us a temporary home.  The Forwarder
works perfectly, but it was only a stop-gap while I was negotiating with my
provider.  Paul and I will discuss the best way to swap the list back to me
so it will look like a normal Mailing List.

        The mechanics will be:-  
        To: majordomo{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

        [message] subscribe glosalist

After that messages to the Glosalist Mailing List will be addressed:-
        To: glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au 

 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 Andy Nousen, I would ask for your land address so that I can send you a
Glosa  "Experimental Dictionaries" disk in the mail; this is in ASCII format
for IBM.  The idea is that the authors have asked me not to release the full
"Glosa 6000" dictionary on the Internet.  So I am sending out the scanned
dictionary on disk to Glosa-pe.  Anyone else on the Forwarder wishing to
recieve the disk can send me a request for it.  The lists are sorted
alphabetically, and there is  Eng -> Gl  and  Gl -> Eng, as well as a
printable three-column dictionary from Glosa to English.

        I look forward to getting more questions like Andy's.

Saluta,

What about neologisms?  To burden or not burden that is the question?  The
beauty of Glosa is in its simplicity and the powerful way it uses its source
lexicon (Greco-Latin terminologies).  New coinages ought to conform to
existing lexical stock, however the user (writer and speaker) should be
allowed to introduce new words and let linguistic evolution take its course.
Words not wanted will not take hold, because the user(s) will not employ them.

I apologize if I went too far (this is only my opinion!).  Feel free to write

*       I agree with your logic, and so does Paul Bartlett, who points out
that two words for the one thing makes for confusion and non-understanding.
so, the 
GE.TXT file will not contain both AQA and HIDRO for water, and a decision in
favour of one is needed.  This does not need to be too difficult, because,
once a person learns the basic vocabulary, they can go on to absorb the
"Literary" dictionary by adding the synonyms, later (EGL.TXT).  There
probably should also be a corresponding  GEL.TXT  file giving Glosa first,
with the various Glosa synonyms.

        As Andy Nousen says, a dictionary of 6000 is daunting as a learner's
dictionary.  I feel that the 1600 word-list was too short; somehow we should
derive a suitable list for a teaching dictionary - one that has enough words
for writer comfort, and sufficient to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive
undersatnding of the language, and how it works.

        Perhaps when you have completed the first trimming of synonyms,
Bill, we should all look at the  GE.TXT  results and suggest additions ad
subtractions to make the dictionary of immediate value to a learner, without
overloading him or her with vocabulary.

Saluta,
Robin

The conlang AllNoun was designed to have only one part of speech, the noun.
A strange but interesting idea. But I couldn't find much about it at that
time. In some ways it appeared to be similar to Glosa, but in addition it
uses particles to convey verbal ideas. I also tend to think that the
Universe requires at least verbs and nouns, actions and things to do the
acting and be acted upon, and that this pair may also be sufficient. But if
I try real hard I can almost see these as One and the Same.

Well done! - I see that you fixed this in the printable Glosa-English
dictionary! But in the original files, if you look up FINGER you find
DIGITA, and if you look up TOE, you also find DIGITA, and neither mentions
the other. Thus we seem to have a homonym, but we don't really - it's just
that DIGITA is more inclusive than the dictionary indicates if you only
happen to look up one of the terms.

*       In the case of "go", it is ''goingness'': the essence of ''going'';
the moving out and away from something.

        At the most abstract level of thought, where we suspend disbelief,
the 'essence of going' is a real thing .. Bill has captured it as " ... One
and the Same."  But, at the non-poetic, more concrete level of language use,
most people have labels tagged as describing either things or actions.  And
this is, I believe, largely non-intellectual, with people opening their
mouths and the words popping out - there being little, or no, reflection
involved in the process.     
        The stock of substantives is kept in some minds as loose and
undifferentiated concepts, while in others, it is divided into two groups as
different and distinct as pitch and rhythm, in music.  I can say that, and
be criticised for it, but I would like to know what is the current knowlege
on the various ways that the lexicon is stored in our brains.  I suspect
that the experts do not know, and that my opinion, based on observation and
reflection, is as good as the next person's.

        Back to Glosa.  This undifferentiedness of the Glosa lexicon is
either a strength or a weakness of the language.  For the poet and the
thinker, it would be a strength allowing conceptualisation of hitherto
unexpressed ideas; for the technically-minded however it gives the language
less depth and solidity than they would like.  The shades of meaning in most
languages are achieved with the use of inflection .. both of nouns and
verbs, and these inflections are missing in Glosa.  .... However, I keep
coming back to the thought that there is a trend towards simplification over
time, and that both Chinese and English are low on inflections: Chinese
because of its long history, and English because of the many cultural
pressures it has been subjected to.  This crude "survival of the fittest"
usages argument is unacceptable to some, but seems to be in tune with the
orgnaic, evolutionary develeopment of language, over time.

        While English and Chinese are hard to learn for many, because they
both appear to lack easily learnable rules, these languages are both strong
on syntax.  It is syntax which is the basis of Glosa's grammatical system:
this is the opposite to a language like latin, where word order is not
important, and the burden of conveying the meaning rests on a complex
inflectional system.

        At the same time this explains the reason for Glosa's appearing to
be like English, and the difficulty in understanding its grammar.  While
there are some conventions like the "Qe, ... " to start a question and the
use of particles to achieve plurality, Glosa tends to follow the syntactic
patterns that have proved preferable, over time, in the languages that rely
largely on syntax for their semantics: Chinese and English.  And these rule
are for the most part unstated, and hard-wired into our brains.

        Am I saying that if we teach people the rules of syntax, then they
will be able to speak and write Glosa faily well.  I guess so. 

        These rules can be written down, though they usually are not, and
this could be one thing holding back the disemination of Glosa.  Quite apart
from syntax, which could almost be a mechanical set of instructions - like a
computer program - there is also the essence of the words, and this also is
usually not taught, other than in senior literature classes at school or at
university.  So, when I first met Glosa, I had to un-learn "is" and discover
that, in Glosa, there were about four concept-words that more accurately
conveyed what, in English, is conveyed using "is."

IS:     essence, true nature .................. ES
        property of ........................... HABE
        becomes, gets ......................... GENE
        measures, equals ...................... EQA

 EG 'An es Robin.'  'U meteo habe frigi.'  'Id gene termo.'  'Fe toto eqa tri.' 

     He is Robin.   The weather is cold.    It is hot.       Her score is three.

Good idea! The synonym-trimming hasn't been much trouble really. It's
the homonym-resolution that's a killer! But it's fun too. But it's
time-consuming. But it's fun anyway.

    How many people around the world are actually using Glosa to any
extent at all I have no idea.  However, I think that members of this
discussion group need to remember that they are a tiny minority and
that ideas they come up with will probably remain largely unknown to
the rest of the world, especially in light of the fact that the Glosa
Education Organization does not participate at present.

    Also, a lot of the discussion seems to be quite rarified.  My
understanding was that Glosa was intended to facilitate general
communication among people of dissimilar native languages much like 
a pidgeon, in which lofty discussions of meta-language considerations
have little place.

Internet is for!  "Synergy" is probably the word I am looking for.  However,
I prefer the flavour more of the "serendipitous," and there could really be
a word, somewhere for 'serendipitous synergy.'  Then, when we discover it,
we can go on to even greater heights of mutual creative stimulation.

        This actually was the way that the Glosa Tense Table emerged:
someone put forward a suggested tense list - the first one could even have
come from me; I was working with a chap who was a Latin-nut, at the time -
and bit by bit, the Table went round the traps, and was added to and
ammended on its journey.  No-one could say they did it, but the final result
was the fastest case of forced evolution I have ever seen.

*       Agreed, but the original Glosa lists were far too much influenced by
the culture that created the Classical lexicons.  I have a contemporary
Greek/English dictionary and a Latin/English dictionary: the contrast is
tangible.  Modern culture is reflected in the Greek dictionary; while in the
Latin one, the cultural references all appear to have been taken from
Plato's speeches.  The roots, largely because they were 'neutral,' offered
modern Science the obvious medium for international discussion; and this
will carry on into the future, with the "dead language" neutrality
continuing to offer the best way of maintaining the balance of power, or
cultural balance, between participants in the world scene.  My favourite
neologism has to be "television," marrying the Greek and Roman, overcoming
the barrier that had remained between these two cultures two millenia after
they had ceased to exist.

*       Yes, with a request like this, how could I refuse?  I am enclosing
the seven offerings as an attachment ... an ASCII one.  Please let me know
if it does not get through, and I will retype it using the Eudora editor.
BTW, I decided to go back in time one year: the only way I could beat the
Eudora Lite Ver. 1 'time-trap,' was to wind my computer's clock back!
        Let me know if they are suitable, and I will try a few more .. even
making up some of my own that use the built-in facilities of Glosa - showing
the elegance of Glosa to advantage.

MY LIFE: The saga continues.  I failed to qualify in the system of train
safe-working called "Block Telegraph," and this means I am not qualified to
work trains through the sections that operate under this system! I did pass
"Road Knowlege," however: this was a viva voce exam, and we had an easy
tester, thank goodness.  Imagine travelling over four train lines in four
days, stopping periodically to look at the track layouts, and learning how
trains are worked through them.  Of course, the shapes of the platforms,
existence of tunnels, systems of safeworking and the division of these into
sections, is included.
        Needless to say, I started learning the station names a month ago,
to be sure I knew them .. and I still temporarily froze in to-day's exam.
Be assured the educational stone age is alive and well in the NSW railway
system.  While the Driver's Inspectors conducting the test are practical
men, who realise the impossibility of the task, and test sympathetically,
the other test, on Block Telegraph has legal connotations, and is sponsored
by the Department of Transport.  The pass mark is 80%, and there were 137
multiple choice questions: I scored 77% and will have one more chance at it,
on the railway's time.
        There are two more test: one a shorter one on a different system of
safeworking, "Single Line Track Circuit"; and the last is on the working of
Inter-Urban trains.  All this is a bit of a strain at 61, but I do wish to
make the extra money!
        
Saluta,
 Robin
