*   Although I have not seen it, this EuroWordNet sounds very promising as a vocabulary standard.  Is it available on the Net?


    What is the next step for the Glosalist group were we to move to standardise the lexicon, and derive functional wordlists at these various levels?  I would put in a plea, here, for adding a few of the Glosa synonyms for the very common concepts, such as "water" - if not at the Mid Learner Level (2441), then at the Glosa Standard Level (5437).


    For me, when I tried my hand at creative writing in Glosa, the avoidance of unnecessary repetition was stylistically essential.  So, if we want people to actually write small booklets in Glosa, then we do not want to put off such creative people by what they could perceive to be the ^straight jacket^ of a rigidly enforced one_concept/one_word rule.

Dear James,

thank you for your link to my www.glosa.org on your page

Dogs can count. Dogs are descended from wolves, which
not only have a large neocortex - the brain's centre
of reasoning - but live in large social groups. So
their mathematical ability could, in evolutionary
terms, have been useful for working out how many
allies and enemies they had in a pack, the researchers
think.

Animals such as birds and rodents can tell when one
pile of objects is bigger than another. But to count,
an animal has to recognise that each object in a set
corresponds to a single number and that the last
number in a sequence represents the total number of
objects.

Many primates have this basic mathematical ability.
But Robert Young, an animal behaviour expert at the
Pontifical Catholic University of Minas Gerais in Belo
Horizonte, Brazil, suspected that dogs do too.

To test the idea, Young and his colleague Rebecca West
of De Montfort University in Lincoln, UK, borrowed a
technique that has been used to show that
five-month-old babies can count. 

A number of toy dolls are placed in front of a baby
and then a screen is raised to hide them. The infant
then watches as some dolls are added or taken away
before the screen is lowered to reveal the final
result. 

If the experimenter has played a trick and
surreptitiously added or taken away a doll, the baby
looks at the dolls for much longer, presumably because
he or she had done the calculation and the number of
dolls contradicts the baby's expectations.

Young and West repeated the experiment on 11 mongrels
using doggie treats. Sure enough, the dogs stared at
the bowls for much longer when the sums did not add
up. 

Dogs paid little attention when one plus one treat
resulted in two treats, the researchers will report in
an upcoming issue of Animal Cognition. But they were
confused when the experiment was manipulated to show
that one plus one treat appeared to equal three
treats, for example.

> Plu pre-parenta de plu kani es plu lupus

> Dogs are descended from wolves

A good demonstration of PLU not working well as a pluralizer
or as a noun-phrase tag. Stripping it down to pidgin level:
"Arkeo parenta de kani es lupus". Yummy! IMO. (Except that
"wolf" should be "lobo" to fit the predominant phonology.)

> Plu zoa [...] Animals [... ] u zoa [...] an animal

> Poli primata [...] Many primates

POLY and MONO both strike me as being apt and beautiful,
but PLU and U/UN are what a Texan might call plug-ugly.
Compare with Ido's nice -O singular and -I plural suffixes.
Italian has "I" for a plural article, maybe Glosa should
borrow it to replace PLU: "u zoa pa vora i zoa". And then
PLU could return to its normal duty, meaning "more".

There have now been some notes to Glosalist, in Glosa and English.  One 
member commented (in Eng) on the one thing that always leaps out at me in 
Glosa texts: the use, or overuse of the pluralizer/article 'plu'.  For 
instance, in one text, 'plu' is used three times in the equivalent of the 
Eng sentence:

The wolf is the ancestor of the dog.

Now, national languages handle such sentences in different ways, but in 
creoles they are always handled in the same way: by zero marking of the 
plural, because in:

Wolves are ancestors of dogs.

_all_ the plurals are nonspecific.  You are not refering to particular or 
presupposed wolves, ancestors or dogs, but those things in general.  For 
Novial J proposed an unmarked number-indeterminate form in -e, which is 
similar in fact to the creole situation.  The marking of nonspecific plurals 
in Glosa does seem to be excessive - if a nonspecific plural needs to be 
marked once in a sentence, does it really need to be marked three times?

There was also a question about the form of 'plu'.  I agree with the member 
who said that 'plu' is best reserved for the positive comparative.  I 
started looking at creole pluralizers: how about 'nan' from Pu, or 'ban' 
from Fr-based creoles (< Fr 'bande de')?

I think the answer is no, it doesn't have to be marker
if it is clear from the context.

For me, ~plu~ makes things more general, and for me,
unmarked nouns tend to suggest that they are referring
to a/the particular thing.

This is obviously my taste. I was looking at the

          The dog is a loyal pet.

My glosaing - Plu kani es plu fide domi-zoa.
Robin's - U kani eqa u fide domi-zoa.

Yet another (pseudo-)parser for Glosa ... 

Like Charles ( http://catty.com/~catty/lang/dict.cgi ), Alexander and 
Syd before, I tried to write a little program, that helps to translate
from and into Glosa by looking up the words of a text in a dictionary.

You can read more about it and get it from my website, 
http://www.glosa.org/en/glosatra.htm .  Mi spe; tu fu habe hedo ko id.
Saluta - Marcel.




Properties 

* Glosatra is a primitive command line program for the console.  It
  has no menus, mouse support, graphics and things like that.
* It can "translate" Glosa-English and English-Glosa.
* The program finds words, word groups and compounds with and
  without hyphem in the dictionary.
* It tries to give a suggestion even if the final vowel of the
  Glosa word in the text is wrong.
* It tries to recognize English words, even if they are not in the
  basic form.
* No case sensitivity: capitalization or not does not matter.
* It can use always the latest version of the GID.  Please download
  the new version.
* Load and run, - no complicated installation because of its
  simplicity.
* Runs on MS-DOS/Windows and Linux.  It could certainly run on
  other platforms, too.  The source code is offered on the web.
* It can use standard-I/O-streams.  So it could be easily started and
  used by other programs, even within a text editor.
* It does in no way claim to be errorfree, professional or
  comfortable.

What is 'du', a progressive/nonpunctual aspect marker?  Then why is it being 
used with a stative verb (be)?  It is like saying in Eng:

The dog is being a loyal pet.

My main point is: I dont see why any articles are needed at all.  Lets look 
at the 1928 Novial equivalent:

Hunde es fidindi haus-animale.

In creoles, such nonspecific plural NPs would be zero-marked (no articles, 
no pluralizers).  I dont see why in Glosa you cant just say:

Kani es/eqa fide domi-zoa.

There is nothing that needs to be added to this sentence to express the 
desired meaning.

> What is 'du', a progressive/nonpunctual aspect marker?

The authors of Glosa were/are blissfully unaware of such things.
I regard DU XXX as English XXX-ING, and GE XXX as English XXX-ED.
So a more direct answer would be "Yes, more or less, in effect,
but not rigorously enough for Bickerton or creole enthusiasts".
Glosa is essentially a relexed Basic English ...

> My main point is: I dont see why any articles are needed at all.

Because we must express definiteness and number somehow, but
Glosa does not provide gracefully appropriate particles; it
turns English "A/AN" into "U/UN" but then decrees it to both
a definite and indefinite singular article ... thus confusion.

I know that Bickerton grandly claims to have discovered the
universal creole grammar, but I tossed his nonsense out with
that of Chomsky; creoles can damned-well have articles, and
I believe that Glosa does need one more (the definite "LA").
With the 3 of them (U singular, and some better plural than
PLU) we could all be happy and frustrate some linguists too.

I only meant 'I dont see why articles are needed at all in this sentence', 
not in Glosa as a whole.  Creoles have articles but only uses them with 
specific NPs (either presupposed-specific (definite) or asserted-specific 
(indefinite)).  They usually have a plural def art or pluralizer, but this 
would not be used in sentences like Nick's.  I dont see why the same system 
could not be used in Glosa.

I am not here to defend Bickertons ideas, much less Chomskys, but I do think 
that those designing IALs with isolating grammar would do well to look at a 
variety of creoles to see what can be learnt from them.

I like to view the 'plu' also as an introducer to a noun phrase and the 'pa, 
fu, du, sio .....' as introducers of a verb phrase. it is relatively easy to 
sort out the syntax and meaning. without the introducing words, glosa can be 
difficult to decipher. [ kevin is using 'ca' and 'da' for this reason]

That has been my sermon here for several years.

My taste would be for a systematic pan-Romance pidgin/creole.

Yes. In normal Glosa, ~du~ is progressive/nonpunctual
aspect marker. Kevin is just using it to mark the
start of the verb phrase. We had a lot of discussion a
while ago on how to identify which word in a Glosa
sentence is the verb. This was one proposed solution.
Many people feel there is a similar problem with
sentence adverbs, when they are not placed before the
verb.

~Fe pa face plu vasa tekno.~ 
  [She made the vases skilfully.] 

Where at first glance ~tekno~ looks to be the object
of the sentence. You can, of course, rearrange the
sentence.

~Fe pa face plu vasa ko tekno.~
~Fe pa tekno face plu vasa.~

I don't have a problem with the original sentence,
which could be said to be "syntactically ambiguous",
but is not "semantically ambiguous".

I note that in O.J.'s book on your site it says

"Indefinite number. ..... a form which was neither
singular nor plural .... Now it is easy in N to make
such forms by simply leaving out the final vowel, thus
'hom' would mean "man or woman or men or women"; this
would be particularly useful in the generic sense
(i.e. when speaking of the whole species), e.g. leon
es kruel, where we say indifferently `the lion is
cruel' (or `a lion is cruel') or `lions are cruel.' "

I think it's fine to say it that way, but I wonder if
you think it is the only way to say it?

Another quote from O.J.'s book -
"nationali lingues non es apti por es mondelingues"

Well, some phrases are unambigous upon first glance, and others are unambigous 
upon lengthy study. I'm not certain, but I suspect this falls into the second 
category.

As I have said before, when I read something like this I assume everything is 
part of the noun phrase (mostly adjectives) until I find a verb flag. So I would 
start out as:

Youthful masculine pleasure-oriented guide-related strong fast vehicle.

No verb. Well, everything seemed fine before guide, so in this case I would 
guess that guide is the verb:

Young masculine pleasure guides/drives strong fast vehicles. Nope.

Youth(ness) masculinely drives strong fast cars. Well, perhaps in poetry one 
might say something like this, but it would be unusual.

I would also wonder if the writer had left out some prepositions, or perhaps had 
 misspelled a word. Or, perhaps you were using some regional idiom without even 
realizing it. After several minutes of consideration, I would probably reach the 
same conclusion that you did about the intended meaning.

Is that they process an IAL should rely on for communication? It would be so 
much easier with VP and NP markers (nu/du/ca, u/plu/da)

juve andro VP hedo duce NP forti tako vagona.

Simple. Unambiguous.

Kevin

>> youth man pleasure guidance intensity speed vehicle

Chinese uses compounds a lot. Add hyphens and it's clearer.
Chinese also has a tradition of poetic 4-morpheme adages.
But in real life they use unambiguous verbs and markers.

> It would be so much easier with VP and NP markers

One could mark default part-of-speech, at least noun vs. verb,
in the lexicon, and then to change one to the other would require
an inflectional suffix or preposition. Or one could say that
any open-class word can function as noun or verb. The authors
have chosen the latter approach, though somewhat inconsistently.
To those who enjoy puzzles and ciphers, the former is preferable.
It is tempting to use the terminal vowel on each word to indicate
the part-of-speech, like some other IALs and Interglossa did.

Yes, youre right.  Although I'm not sure why J felt he had to drop the -e 
ending for the indef. number.  Novial has an indef. art., unlike Ido, so eg. 
'hunde' is not necessarily default singular.  However it seems that J felt 
it should be.

>Another quote from O.J.'s book -
>"nationali lingues non es apti por es mondelingues"

Well here is the weakness of J's e-dropping idea, and why he later abandoned 
the indef. number: lingu, mondelingu !  Not good, esp. when the 'u' in 
lingue would usually be [w], the main stress being on the first vowel.

How ought one deal with a crying child?

1 Pretend that is not happening. Being silent is hard.
The people around you, are looking at you strangely.
You have to seem as though you feel no blame.

2. Draw its attention to something else. This works
for short time. The child learns the way to get your
attention. You will need to work harder next time.

3. Sympathy. The child does want your pity. It wants
you to react. It learns that you are week.

4. Shout. The people around you are looking at you
more strangely. The chid is crying even louder. You
cannot hide your shame.

5. Give in. The child will always get what it wants.
You will have no peace.

6. Make fun of it. You get more noise and more
frustration.

7. Punishment. You get even more noise than you think
is possible from a small person. The child resents
you. It will await its opportunity. Look out!

8. Praise all good behaviour. This is very hard work.
Perhaps, because it is counter-intuitive or because
you parents didnt behave in this way with you. But
the child learns to enjoy behaving well. And everyone
is happy.

Long ago we collected and combined some English word lists,
and I recently upgraded it. It's sorted into frequency levels
like the old Thorndike/Eaton list (which served as the basis
for IALA's interlingua dictionary). I think you want something
similar for Glosa, and the easiest way I can think of is to
collect "votes" from several people as to relative importance
of each Glosa word, then combine the scores to obtain a list
from which you can take the top 1000 or howevermany you like.

There is not and can never be such a rule in the real world.
Actually, I find the Glosa 6000+1800 (full set) inadequate.
According to the rules of Mega-Glosa, all the international
words are included, not just the ones listed; I'd rather
throw out the listed lexicon than exclude them. (A good
source might be the on-line IALA dictionary -- why not?)

Judging from some of the recent discussions on the Glosa list, although 
isolating grammar is definitely the way forward for any new IAL, I wonder 
whether interlinguists are yet in a position to really develop a suitable 
isolating grammar for an IAL.  There seems to be a real lack of 
understanding, or what I would call _technique_, when it comes to utilizing 
the possibilities of isolating structure in IAL grammar.  For example, I 
cannot bring myself to accept that there is no altenative to using a 
distinctive ending for each part of speech in order to clarify which is the 
noun, which is the verb etc. in a Glosa sentence.  The fact that people are 
having recourse to such devices really demonstrates the lack of any kind of 
technological advancement in this area.

What I think we could do with as a preliminary to any such discussions, is 
some kind of complete (or at least rich) theory of the possibilities of 
isolating structure.  What I am suggesting is that, prior to trying to 
develop an IAL based in isolating grammar, we equip ourselves with a Theory 
of Isolating Grammar.  So that when we want to know how we can distinguish 
noun from verb, we can refer to an established theory which will tell us a) 
what the possibilities are, and b) what implications each one has for the 
rest of the grammar.

In IAL discussions, the kind of answers to questions we commonly ask tend to 
be completely different when one leaves behind morphology and considers only 
isolating solutions.  For example:

Plurals.  Traditionally we ask: should we form plurals in -s, -i or -j?  In 
an isolating grammar this becomes: should we use a plural article or a 
pluralizer?  Should a pluralizer be obligatory when plurality is otherwise 
indicated?  Should a pluralizer be used with nonspecifics?  and so on.

In this and other instances, the whole debate seems to expand beyond 
recognition once morphology is renounced, almost like going from Euclidean 
to non-Euclidean geometry, or from Newtons laws to Einsteins.  The 
possibilities suddenly multiply.

However, at the moment we are absolute beginners with all these new 
possibilities.  We dont know what they are and we dont know how to use them. 
  I think the only way to improve this situation is to initiate a systematic 
inquiry into the whole field of isolating structure.  What we need, in line 
with both TG grammar and Popperian theory, is a device which generates all 
and only the possible morphology-free grammars of a language which must 
express a given set of semantic/grammatical ideas.  In fact, what we would 
probably do is decide what set of ideas we want to be able to express in an 
IAL, and base the device on that set.  I dont think it would be too hard to 
decide on a working set of ideas to be expressed.

I would like to know what people think of this idea.  If people think it is 
worth doing, then I suggest a similar procedure to that which led to the 
Basis Project: first set up a list for preliminary discussions on isolating 
grammar and the idea of a theory, and then, if possible, start an open 
project on the same list to develop the theory I propose.  How about Project 
Isola?

Charles sometimes suggests modifying the last letter to indicate part of
speech. As far as I know, no other Glosa-pe like that idea. Most
Glosa-pe seem happy not having clear flags for parts of speech, and
relying on intuitive interpretation.

Personally, I want simple markers to indicate the start of the "Verb
Phrase" and the start of the "Direct Object Phrase". In my own language
(Glo), which is still about 90% compatible with Glosa, I am
experimenting with 'ca' and 'da', respectively.  I tried 'nu' and 'du'
as VP markers, but they just didn't work well. And I'm not satisfied
with u/plu for noun marking for a variety of reasons that I can share if
you really care.

I would probably participate, although I'm a bit skeptical about what

Of course not. Proven by experience.

All the real linguists think interlinguists are daft.

Linguistics has plenty to say. Pidgins and creoles arise
spontaneously, and serve their people well -- much better
than pseudo-clever projects. Any speech community builds
a common language, the reverse has never happened.

Been discussed here already. Been done, by real linguists.

It was Hogben's idea, and I like it in Ido. But I agree it's not
best for Glosa, just a tempting idea in cases of ambiguity.

That sounds right to me. One can always add a particle,
without getting too tedious about it, and elide whenever
the meaning is truly obvious. Soft rules, not hard ones.

It isn't, though, because it's just another in a long series
of similar "ecumenical" projects involving always the same
20 AUXLANG agitators. They don't know or care anything about
Glosa, they just enjoy barging in and disrupting. None have
credentials in language engineering (or concensus building).
They have plenty of other venues to argue with each other.
I always find it amusing when they venture into sci.lang
and their pet theories get shot down by actual scholars.
What I like to read here is talk about Glosa, by people
who have at least some genuine interest in it.

This solution seems to be more fitting to an isolating grammar.  However, 
the first question that comes into my head is: if the different parts of 
speech are easily identifiable in natural isolating languages, then what 
methods to those langs employ?  And the answer is that we really have no 
idea, because no-one has ever done a detailed study of these langs to find 
out.  This, of course, would form part of the isolating grammar project.

>I would probably participate, although I'm a bit skeptical about what

I will probably not even set up the list for several months, as the Basis 
Project takes priority.  So I will leave you to think about it for a while.

'me' existed before then and is time 1

the back phrase has number and = 'the sentence'

I noticed that Rick Morneau has finally HTMLized his monumental
"design document" Lexical Semantics, and has changed his ontology
in an interesting way. I think it could be borrowed as an outline
to arrange Glosa concept-words. See appendix C (if interested):
http://www.srv.net/~ram/lexical_semantics.html

Another approach is WordNet's hierarchy. They now have a
much nicer interface, though it's still a generation behind
(Tcl/Tk instead of HTML/CGI). And it's a 12mb download:
http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~wn/

In each case, the nouns are more relevant to Glosa vocab
selection than are the verbs/etc.

The world premiere of what is believed to be the first
ever Cornish feature film took place in front of a
select audience of peers and MPs at the Palace of
Westminster yesterday.

Bitter Sweet, which was filmed entirely in Cornwall
using a Cornish cast speaking the Cornish language, is
a story of love that becomes corrupted by drugs. 

Actress Helen Rule, who plays the female lead Becky,
said it was difficult at first to grasp the text. 

"It was pretty tough. I've never seen Cornish written
out and to look down at it on paper, it was difficult
to learn. 

"But it was easy to pick up, once I got the different
pronunciations." 

"I hope it raises the profile of the Cornish language
and makes more people aware of it, it is important
that people are aware of the language," said Mr
Kovacs, the film-maker. 

This just happens to be the first Cornish feature
film but many more will come, I'm making another film
in the language."

face - MP head/ MP helpw
ex - could be BP intro/ MP help intro word

I think about it quite differently. For me, ~gene~ is very intimately
connected to the "verb" itself. ~gene face~ is almost like a single word
for me--it is certainly a single concept. The inverted form of "to make"
is "to be made". I don't think of it in terms of shifting phrases
around.

Moving the ~gene~ (or ~ge~) away from the verb makes it VERY difficult
for me to understand the sentence.

I can't understand dog-Glosa, but it seemed to be a complaint
about the NO and NE prefixes. If you dislike them, then use
NEGA and NULI instead. (Just don't say NO.)

Yes, I mentioned this problem several months ago. My guess is that the
GID is merely inconsistent. Which, of course, leads me to believe that a
language should not have two words that are that close in sound and
appearance, while being similar but distinct in meaning. If even the
language creators are confused by them, what are the rest of us supposed
to do?

I stand by my 'ne'=without (0), 'no'=oposite (-1). If anyone has more
authoritative, or more helpful definitions of 'ne' and 'no', I would
like to hear them.

I compiled the "Glosa Basic Reference" which first went up on the world
wide web several years ago.  Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby approved it.  In
the "GBR" 'ne' is "not" and 'no-' forms opposites.  Without going back
to look, I don't know whether these are the ways things are defined in
other G.E.O. publications or not.  One thing that was awkward when I
got interested in Glosa some years ago was some inconsistency in
publications.

My suggestion is that it is more consistent with GID
and international usage of non- to define it as
~holo ne~ [not at all], a kind of English-language
opposite, as opposed to an Esperanto/Ido one. And to
define ne- as ~ne holo~ [not entirely/not
completely].

An example from GBR ~non-ofero~ is [withhold] and not
request to have back. 

[By the way, I think GBR is still the best thing we've
got on  Glosa grammar. 18 Steps is more up to date
but requires a lot more work to find out what you want
to know.]

There are 2 problem words (rather than a dozen or so
with the Esp/Ido understanding of opposite) that
strike me immediately ~no-face~ and ~no-pli~ which I
think are due to the English words unmake and
unfold. English un-, in general, mean ~holo ne~,
dont you think? If I made up a word, say "unbushy",
what would that mean to you?

I think the words "destroy" and "unfold" ought to have
been ~versi-face~ and ~versi-pli~. 

{~versi~ [back to begin; back to start; back; replace;
restore; return; reversal; reverse]}

BUT ... with the judicial addition of a couple of NOUN PHRASE Markers it
could be meaningful; I would also prefer ~argo~ [drive] to ~duce.~

  Assuming singularity:-
   U juve andro hedo duce u forti tako vagona.
   [The young man happily drives the very fast car.]
     OR
   [The young man enjoys to_drive/driving the very fast car.]

  If, as I discover, the 'target language' sentence is in the plural, then
I simply alter subtly the NOUN PHRASE Markers to indicate this fact:-
   Plu juve andro hedo duce plu forti tako vagona.
   [Young men enjoy driving very fast cars.]

  And with a couple of changes to make the Glosa more to my liking, I swap
main Verbs and abbreviate the Quantitative modifier:-
   Plu juve andro hedo argo plu fo tako vagona.
   [Young men enjoy driving/to_drive very fast cars.]

Cc: glosalist{at}lists{dot}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

The following passage may throw some light on the debate about how/whether 
to mark PoS in an isolating language:

Because Vietnamese does not use inflectional morphology to distinguish 
different parts of speech, it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a 
given item is a verb, noun or adjective, apart from its syntactic context. 
This has led some researchers to claim that such form-class distinctions are 
purely functionally-determined in Vietnamese (and other isolating 
languages); that is, the label of a particular item is entirely a function 
of its syntactic distribution. A more extreme version of this argument is 
the claim that form-class distinctions drawn from IndoEuropean languages, 
for example, the distinction between verbs and adjective, are inapplicable 
to isolating languages. To counter such claims, the task of the universalist 
is to find evidence that distinguishes proposed form-classes independently 
of their syntactic distribution.

This is from the Vietnamese Grammar Project reference grammar, section 4.1:

The important point to realize is that 99% of all people
despise grammar (and grammarians, the other 1%) and so
Glosa does not want the damned Espo-Ido POS vowels.
It makes little sense even in pseudo-agglutinative IALs
because there are more than 5 necessary POS, even the
ancient grammarians knew that.

I require some information on which moods are expressible in the languages 
which I am not an expert on: LsF, Glosa, Interlingua, Occidental.

In Esp and Ido, conditional is expressed by -us, and imperative, optative 
and hortative by -u/-ez:  me vidus, videz!, li videz!, ni videz!

In Novial, conditional is by vud, imperative by the simple ground form, 
optative by mey, and hortative by let:  me vud vida, vida!, mey les vida!, 
let nus vida!

Which of these moods are expressible in the other RefList langs, and how?

Thanks.

Occidental has such a vocabulary. I have found it to be a
frustration, a hindrance, no help at all. The learner will
be unable to find what he wants, and then grow weary of
coining new compounds for common notions; amateur etymologists
are not easy to train. It would be far better to have a
complete and comprehensive word list, and if possible there
should also be a good-enough translation program available
on the web. Only then will we see any significant number
of people writing in Glosa, and only then will people have
much chance of understanding that which gets posted.

    Please note that the original post did not appear in the AUXLANG
list, but rather in Auxlang-Dialog, which is a separate list.  I
forwarded it because I considered it to be an entirely legitimate
request for information about Glosa which members of this list might
best be able to answer.

    I do not agree.  I think that Hogben showed, with the original
Interglossa, that a carefully chosen vocabulary can be operated well. 
The key, as I see it, is to know the vocabulary thoroughly, so that one
is at home in it, so to speak.  The Voice of America, as I recall,
makes international radio broadcasts in a limited vocabulary, Special
English I think it is called, of around 2000 words, apart from proper
names (and, presumably, the residual inflected forms that English has).

How disingenuous you are to say that, when you know perfectly well

    If you choose to be impolite, there is not much I can do about
that.  However, I repeat to other members of Glosalist that I posted
what I consider to be an entirely reasonable and appropriate request
for information about Glosa.

You simply lied and got caught lying. Typical AUXLANGer.

I would really prefer that you (Charles) keep your anti-AUXLANG flames
to yourself, or post them on AUXLANG itself. I find them to be
inappropriate here. Again, the original message itself seemed perfectly
reasonable.

I would answer the question, but don't feel qualified to do so.

Let me annotate this for you, Kevin:

Paul Bartlett has known James Chandler and Jay Bowks for years.
They pal around on AUXLANG and make periodic forays into every
single discussion group related to artificial languages.
Their purpose is only to distract or disrupt.

> > If you choose to be impolite, there is not much I can do about that.

It was not "impolite" to call him on his little trick of
denying that this most recent incursion was coming from
the usual band of AUXLANG creeps. Why did he take the time
to deny it?

> You simply lied and got caught lying. Typical AUXLANGer.

Typical because AUXLANGers are famous for these tactics,
transparently false except to newcomers. You've said you
aren't interested in history, but that's your mistake:
History tells you all you need to know about the present.

> I would really prefer that you (Charles) keep your

Paul,

Thanks for forwarding my request for information to Glosalist.  I was going 
to say something about the disgraceful outburst by Charles Catty that 
greeted your message, but it seems now I dont have to, because Charles has 
since disgraced himself with an even more disgraceful outburst, this time 
involving expletives.

I will just say that if a member of one my lists ever attacked another 
member using language of that kind, they would get a stern first warning, 
and no second warning about their conduct.  I wonder what action the owner 
of Glosalist will decide to take.

I know what action was taken against you for invading the Occ list,
James. Your stooge Jay Bowks has been intercepted there several times
under various aliases with several viruses. (So why didn't you thank
him, too?) This has been just another typical AUXLANGer operation.
The result is that every unmoderated IAL forum gets destroyed,
and you again have only each other to argue with.

I think Kevin's experiment with Glo shows that a small
well chosen vocabulary is all that is needed for
effective communication. If Glosa is intended to be
used by people, who don't speak a European language, a
small vocabulary is a definite advantage.

What is going on here?  My posts to Glosalist seem to be being intercepted.  
Is Charles Catty moderating this list or something?  If so, you people dont 
know what you've got.  I do: trouble.

I would like to know whether my posts are being allowed through to 
Glosalist, and if not why not.  If I am not a legitimate member of this 
list, I would like an explanation as to why not.

For the record, I have no covert arrangement or association with any other 
auxlanger, Jay Bowks, Bob Petry or Paul Bartlett included.  I will admit to 
having exchanged personal mails from time to time with the latter two, but 
this has never involved any kind of conspiracy between us.  We are all 
independent people with our own views and ideas.  If Charles doesnt like it 
because those views dont always agree with his own, then that is his problem 
and no-one else's.

Kordiale,
James Chandler

Look Catty,
I'm no one's stooge, 
I'll refrain from saying
what I feel like saying
to you in response because
I'm not going to be losing
my religion over your taunts.

I have not had anything to
do with any viruses. For 
you to be accusing me of
this is an outright lie. Some
thing that you obviously
are used to doing.

When Bob claimed that 
I'd somehow "attacked"
his website, I actually
only visited enough to 
read through his pages.
He's got it rigged where
once you visit, every request
for a graphic on the page
he counts as a visit. And if
you have your browser
refresh it doubles every 
time, so if you go to the
index and then run through
the links on the page you
end up racking up incredible
amounts of hits, actually he
is either using this to inflate
the numbers of visitors 
deliberately, without my help, 
or he doesn't know any better.
But I did nothing except visit
the pages and read what
he had put on the web. 

There's nothing wrong
in looking at public pages,
is there?

No one in any of the lists
I belong to has ever claimed
to have received a virus from
my machines, nor my server.
You seem to thrive in making
unjustified accusations and 
then offer no proof, while
underhandedly trying to shut
off people's access by falsely
accusing them of wrongdoing
to their ISP's. There are words
to describe what you do, Catty,
but I think it beneath me to 
sink that low.

Since,
Jay B.

I find your assertion that I lied to be both false

Dear Shelly,
I don't know what
Catty (Charles) is
up to, but I've been
on this Glosa list
for years and even
precede him as a
member of it. I haven't
been as active in glosa
list because of other
projects, but whenever
he and I have exchanged
messages he's only shown
this inimical attitude and
I've found it impossible
to have an intelligent
conversation with him
over anything.

I believe the list owner
is Robin, and he can and
I hope will do something
about his language. I also
agree it's uncalled for and
no one should have to put
up with it.

Since,
Jay B.

    Several years ago, using only the materials that went into the
Glosa Basic Reference, I exchanged two letters each way with a man in
China who said that he knew only a little English, and I know none of
the languages of China.  We were able to communicate.

    I my experience, it comes down to the level of communication

native tongues, I support the idea of a well-chosen vocabulary which is
not too large.  If one wants to write a Nobel-prize-winning novel, that
may be a different matter.

Catty,
You're barking up
the wrong tree. I 
really feel sorry for
your paranoia, you
should get help.

And the bit about
"evolution", don't
even think about
putting down my
religious beliefs 
regarding creation, 
perlas ante porcos,
you've got no 
appreciation for
the Truth. Too 
bad, too sad!

Since,

Catty,
You're delusional.
I've never sent any
viruses to anyone.
If Bob claims otherwise,
he lies.

And please don't tell

you seen the movie

maybe you should get

delusional.

The 12th volume of the dictionary has been published.

The final volume of a unique dictionary of the Scots
language has been published. 

The Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue (DOST) was
originally proposed in 1919 by Sir William Craigie, a
Scottish member of the team which produced the Oxford
English Dictionary (OED). 

The work, which has been supported by Scottish
universities and charitable foundations and is
published by Oxford University Press, aims to define
and preserve Lowland Scots, which many people speak. 

Academics said completion of the dictionary required
great scholarship and perseverance. 

It contains the building bricks of the language of
Lowland Scotland and is based on a million quotations
from the Middle Ages to the 17th Century. 

Sir William Craigie suggested that the OED should be
followed by other reference works including a
Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue, the first
volume of which, A to C, was published in 1937. 

It has taken another 65 years for the final volume to
be finished. 

The team who worked on the dictionary gathered at a
conference at Glasgow University on Saturday to
celebrate the end of the project. 

Senior editor, Marace Dareau, gave the keynote speech
and said Scots need to have their language recognised
in its own right. 

The editor said: "When a wee Scottish kid goes to
school speaking Scots, he's sat down and taught to
read and write in English, another language. 

"His reality is not acknowledged and this is bound to
lead to a lack of self esteem. He's being told 'what
you come here and offer is not good enough'." 

The 12-volume dictionary costs just over £2,000 and
will be accessible through the internet in 2004.

Posted on the Notes on The Science of Extreme Situations are two new pages 
that use Glosa:

Notes front page is: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/notes.htm

The Glossary is at: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/glossary.htm

A journal article in Glosa is: http://www.richmond.edu/~wgreen/notesiapgl.htm

Notes is a peer reviewed technical journal in disaster science.  Obviously 
our pages are a work in progress.  I would appreciate the members of the list 
who are actual Glosa users reading the article, comparing it against the 
English text, and assisting in correcting any of my errors (of which I assume 
there are a number).  

Our intent is to eventually offer all articles we publish in English, other 
hemispheric languages, Internacia Lingvo, and Glosa.  We see this as a 
serious long term effort by our University's Emergency Management and 
Disaster Science department to support Glosa as an international disaster 
technical language.

I thought G6000 was a good idea. One had 6000 E words which led one to 1000G 
ones. I should like something one those lines and which included useful 
compounds of G1000 words so that I could look up in my 15000 E word list and 
find something there already put into G. Idleness on my part but useful for 
learners

The idea that 1000 roots can generate a realistic vocabulary
was already disproven over a century ago by Esperanto, which
had the advantage of a large set of derivational suffixes.
The inevitable result was that Espists added thousands more
roots to fill the gaps. Glosa's authors did recognize that
Hogben's original idea of a minimal vocabulary was unworkable,
and selected a bunch more from the obvious (Romance) sources.
Now there remains a core set of Greek-derived words re-spelled
so as to conflict with the Latinate majority -- similar to the
English high-frequency Anglo-Saxon roots uneasily mixing with
the more "learned" (and more international) Latinate ones.
I doubt this will be resolved any time soon ...

Sid,

You are thinking of "5000 English into Glosa 1000".
"Glosa 6000" lists additional Glosa words beyond the
"Central Glosa 1000" list.
