   When proposing an addition to the lexicon, it is likely to be more
widely accepted if you give Glosa example including it in sentences with
English translation.

   This is in line with my understanding of the production of Glosa

  "The girl went to milk the cow."

  "The girl went to milk the cattle."

  ~U ju-fe pa veni te gene lakti ex fe plu fe-bovi.~

  "The girl went to milk her cows."

   What is self-consistent beyond human authority: perhaps the universal

possessive pronoun or the counter?  
  IE   somebody's   one/more  cow

    In this case I feel that, logically, the function of the pers.pron is
of a lower order than the discriminating noun indicator.  Add this idea to
the one that says "a word is modified by its precedent", and then consider
a phrase from the 'head final' structure point of view.
    If all this does mean that words build up in significance in a phrase,
then, in the case of the possessive 'abstraction' "somebody's" is less
discriminating that the 'number abstraction' "one or more."

*  In general, the determinant/NOUN_PHRASE_marker comes first, but there is
some sort of logic which asks are some categories of 'modifier' external to
the main phrase, and I believe that the possessive is one of these.

*  I'd say that the hyphenated compound, ~fe-bovi~ is always a "cow."
   Also, when the possessed category is in the singular, IE "cow" not
"cows," then the correct thinking is to see the poss.pers.pron and the
number_marker particle as alternatives, probably mutually exclusive.
   If it's a straight, singular phrase then ~u~ is in; but, if the NOUN is
possessed, then the poss.pers.pron is used as an alternative NOUN PHRASE
indicator, EG
  ~U fe-bovi greso longo u via.~    "The cow walks along the road."

  ~Fe bovi greso longo u via.~      "Her bovine walks along the road."

  Of course, were it necessary to differentiate between her bull and her
cow, then we have to get out of 'elision mode,' so we'd know if ^it's
Arthur or Martha^.
   Thus:-
 ~Fe fe-bovi greso longo u via.~    "Her cow walks along the road." AND

 ~Fe an-bovi greso longo u via.~    "Her bull walks along the road."

*  Although Lancelot and Ronald have the reputations, I have to suggest
that the PLU modifies the SIMI, and does not modify the TU: it is as if the
~tu~ is outside the brackets, while the monkeys, ~plu simi~, are inside it.
 In fact, we can say that the ~tu~ modifies (owns) both the ~plu~ and the
~simi~.

*  By half closing your eyes, you can see the brackets around "the apes",
with the possessive placed either in front of the leading brace, or after
the closing brace: the ~de~ can be seen as functioning as the closing brace.
IE               tu (plu simi)    =    (plu simi) tu

         EG  The cow-girls' cows' bull.

*  This looks like a case where the abstract noun has stretched so widely
that it cannot have a word-for-word direct translation.  It would seem that
Wendy has called in the auxilliaries, and has produced compound nouns, or
what we could call, in English, "phrasal nouns."
   This appears to be a new category among word groupings, such that the
translator must choose from a family of related compound nouns the right
one for the instance he or she is translating.

Dear friends,
Now, it is already the year 2003 in my country, though it is still the 2002,
e.g. in the UK and the USA!

I was not very active glosa-pe during the second half of the year, but
believe me, my heart was always with you!

Excuse me for letters, I have not answered yet! I know that the months
passed, but I was (and I am still) so busy.

Mi fu responde a plu grama, in bi fu meno; ka mi fu habe vakatio, meno-bi.

Happy New Year, dear friends, plu karo glosa-be.

I want the year to be the begining of the peace-and-tolerance-age in the
world and hearts of all humans on the Earth!

Saluta,

I am happy, that the dictionary has made another advance, but it can
be seen, that there is a far way to go, yet:  So many changes only
by comparison with one little list!  It would be good to have a

Excellent work Marcel,
   This consistency - or at least of being as consistent as the various
language/cultures will allow - of a Planned Language across the spectrum of
National Languages, is one of the unspoken problems in  auxilliary language
discussion.
   I did print out the 144 pages of the GID Eng-->Glo dictionary - most
probably the  frgl1ko.htm  list.  Perhaps I should now print out the
gl1kfr.htm  list: I must look. 
   What do your mnemonics mean: I remember best if I understand what I am
trying to place in memory, 
  EG fr-gl-l-k-o  French to Glosa list(GID) knitted in OK.  (?) 
    or
     gl-l-k-fr  Glosa list(GID) now_inKluding French    (??)   ;-) 

   But being serious, again, I would ask what length the <gllkan> file
(Glosa list(GID) inKluding ALL national_languages) might be; and, when will
it be put together by our unpaid volunteers - mainly you, Marcel?

   There are two other serious questions: the first involves 'criteria' for
addition, or creation, of new words for an evergrowing Glosa GID lexicon;
and and the second is by what mechanism, and in what format, will such a
<gllka-05> file be published (Glosa list[GID] inKluding ALL words
adopted_by_2005)?  I am looking into the future, and suggesting that a
Glosa dictionary should carry the year of production in its name, and I
might anticipate that we could have such a list completed by 2005.   For
example, I currently use  _Glosa 6000(1992)_  and the  GID(2/9/02)
[.../gid/engl.htm].  

   We cannot wait until the language is perfected before getting some form
of "international" dictionary out into general circulation; and, we cannot
wait for Wendy's health, and finances, to improve sufficiently, before we
publish an 'authorised' Glosa World Dictionary (or "Glosa Munda Diktionari").

   I know there are already two Glosa usage communities, the hard-copy
based Third-worlders (mainly Africans), and the Internet-connected
'globals.'  This causes a few problems, but the implication is that the two
should not be allowed to separate too far; and, that any GID ought to be
paper-printable in some form.  For postage reasons I think of the extremely
flimsy "war-time paper."

  This returns me to the theme of decisions.  Do we have a core of people
who are reasonably satisfied with the original Ron Clark conception of
Glosa (circa 1992), to form a "Trustee Group" that can oversee the
application of criteria concerning the addition of new words; and, which
can authorise, and ensure, the publication - in various forms - of accepted
standard dictionaries of Glosa.
  Unfortunately, the latter requirement of such 'trustees' involves the
economic question of the actual printing of paper books, booklets and
lists.  Without a practical centralisation of authority, we will continue
to have non-matching dictionaries and a quandry over what is, and is not,
Glosa.  So, Wendy runs the Glosa Education Organisation charity, and hold
the funds; but how are these funds being employed in furthering education
in, and teaching of, Glosa.
  I have avoided for years any though of becoming more dominant in the
Glosa saga, but Marcel's prognosis has prompted me to make these
suggestions.  It does lokk like there will be a 'Burning Bush' in the
Middle East before there is an authorised  _Glosa 2500 Learners'
Dictionary_.  However, I feel we should see what we have to offer the
world, and get it ready in usable form asap.
 
  Very simply, I was going to go through the old GID, and select from it
the 250 most functional words, to make up the Learners' Dictionary.
>From numerous earlier discussions, the dictionary size of 2500 - 3000
words came up as a workable, practical compromise between the ease of
learning, and the ability to communicate meaningfully.
  I suspect that the extra words that Marcel has included in the <frgllk>
file will not be very significant in the compilation of a shorter
dictionary for learners: the question of size/weight/postage is more
important at the lower end of the dictionary scale, than is the matter of
completeness.
  I ask again for URLs to minimum word lists, but I am probably being lazy,
and ought to be able to find them by typing something into Google.  The
lists I would peruse are in the range 2000 to 5000 words.
 
  And while, people CAN look up words by turning on their computers,
calling up the file, and skimming through it, ... a printed dictionary is
infinitely quicker.  And, in the fast-food era, we are also in the time of
fast-learning, and almost instantly-learnt auxlangs.

  Glosa can deliver on this latter, as Ron was oft wont to say: he claimed
that a Classical scholar, once the ground-rules of Glosa were laid out
before them, could start speaking in fairly accurate Glosa almost instantly
- calling upon their knowlege of Greek and Latin roots.  So, I put the case
that economically printable dictionaries ought not be excluded from our
Glosa "Trustees'" wish-list.  With better format, wore words fit onto a
page; with thinner paper, postage prices are less; and the marginal
learner, who is attracted to a small book he can buy for, say A$15 (incl
p&p), might find having to download files, and print them out, might be
just that bit more irksome.
   Anyone know of a source of low-cost, preferably opaque and strong,
air-mail paper?

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S.  I hope that everyone is thinking about the article they are going
to write, in Glosa, to submit for the next Plu Glosa Nota.  Mine will be
about the recent drought and bush-fires, here in Australia.  And don't
forget: the reader wants to know your thoughts and feelings as well as the
facts.  While Glosa stands by its reputation as being a language for
science, it is in the minds of the people that the battle will be won, or
lost.  We need to EMOTE people through the colour of our language, and from
the strength of the emotion we convey.   "Wow: if a designed language can
have such communication power built into it, I'd better learn it."     R.

The thing I call GID (Glosa Internet Dictionary or Glosa Inter-reti
Diktionaria) is http://www.glosa.org/gid/glen.txt (gl=Glosa to
en=English).

GID is the project once started by you (Robin), Paul Bartlett and Bill
Patterson.

There are some other files in the www.glosa.org/gid directory, which
are directly compiled from this file by computer algorithms, so they
must not have contradictions to glen.txt:
  glen.htm (HTML-Version), engl.txt (en=English to gl=Glosa),
  engl.htm, coglen.htm (only most useful Glosa-words, co=Core) and
  coengl.htm.

Please do not mix them up with the French files:
frgl1ko.htm is the fr=French to gl1k=Glosa1000 o=original list by
  Ashby/Clark.
frgl1k.htm is same list, but with corrections (no "o" for original),
and gl1kfr.htm is the reversed corrected list, Glosa-French.
None of these three lists are a translation of GID!  GID is more
comprehensive and better!



 >    There are two other serious questions: the first involves

 > evergrowing Glosa GID lexicon; ...

I would like a GID that ...
- includes all existing Glosa word lists by Ashby/Clark.
- supplements (as few as possible) missing words, which are not in the
    Richmond-lists, but which are needed for communication.
- clears up errors and inconsistencies in the Ashby/Clark material
    (for example see www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm ).
- leads the user to prefereable synonyms and gives a basic vocabulary
    for beginners (Core, coglen.htm).

Actually there are included:
- "Glosa 1000 to English" list from the book "18 Steps to Fluency"
- "Glosa 6000"
- "English 5000 to Glosa 1000" list from the book "Central Glosa".
- the list from the book "Francais - Glosa 1000".

Unfortunately not included yet:
- the list from the book "Deutsch - Glosa 1000"
- the list from the book "Español - Glosa 1000"
- the "Central"-list, book "Central Glosa", p. 25-56 (very important)
- the vocabulary from the lessons and pictures of "18 Steps to
  Fluency ..."
- vocabulary from as many as we can PGN-articles.

Sad: before this work done (scanning the Ashby/Clark material), I do
not see reasonable space for creativity in creation of new words for a
Glosa dictionary.

But the good news: we do not yet have to found a
word-creation-committee right now with all its fights and troubles.

*  Very true: but I suspect that more needs to be writen in Glosa to give
us as wide a choice as possible.  Simpler practical sentences would be
better starting points, for learners, than this complicated on.

*   And this - for Glosa - requires a generally understood concept of how
syntax-based grammar works, in the setting of words that are not labelled
as distinct parts of speech.  What actual elements of grammar are valid for
Glosa?
My thought is that the Functional Grammar approach, created by MAK
Halliday, is probably the closest of the published theories.  However, I
still believe that, considering Funtional Grammar was invented primarily
for English, its concepts will need some tweaking for Glosa.

Earlier in tutors one was given long lists

*  Printed alphabet is easy, but the sound of the letters, and the
pronunciation of the words require much more technology, and can prove
difficult.  I still recall the reply from a Glosa contact in Brazil, to
whom I sent a cassette of spoken glosa.  "Thank you.  It looks very nice,
but I know no-one with a cassette player, so I can't hear it."

   I question the format of your method here.  I have always preferred the
line under line approach whereby the learner can see the related parts and
their explanations, directly under one another.

This web page might interest some of the IAL collectors amongst us.
something I'm putting together to be as simple and none european etc as I 
can. Later, I shall see what has already been done on similar lines.
I suspect there is need for a few IALs, if they are worth their salt, several

LAYMAN'S TERMS
This applies to Glosa and Glosalist also. I used to know a fair amount of 
linguist jargon but some that gets bandied about on the list has me 
flummoxed.
In Glosa, English and many other languages the verb/doing word/etc comes in 
the middle[ish] of the sentence, the subject before it and the object after:- 
subject[fox] verb[jumps] 'object'[dog]. In Hindi the verb comes last:- fox 
dog jumps. I found that subject and object gets mixed together in my mind - I 
prefer SVO. 
In 'the quick brown fox', the phrase is introduced by 'the' which tells us 
that we have a noun phrase [subject/object]. The most important word is 'fox' 
so I'm calling it 'head word'. 'quick' and 'brown' add more meaning/precision 
to the head word, they modify the meaning.They are modifiers.
In Eng or Glosa, I first meet the intro word [very useful] but I now have to 
read and memorise the next 4 words before I can find the head w. In Eng word 
4 [jumps] is clearly a verb so 'fox' is the head. If I am new to E or G, that 
is not too easy.
In my experiment, I have intro [the] head [fox] and then the less important 
stuff [quick, brown]
fox jump dog
with the intro words
the fox do jump the dog
THE FOX quick brown DO JUMP [over] THE DOG lazy
? shall consider 'over' is a modifier of 'jump'
If someone is new, he/she can ignore the less important stuff until he/she 
gets the basic meaning

'c'
I have suggested that the pronunciation is the same as that in IPA - more 
perhaps later.
b d f  k l m n p s t v z sound much as in English.
c sounds much like 'ch' in 'church', j is like 'y'in 'yes', r is 
rolled/trilled, g is always like 'get'.

The word-list from the book "Español - Glosa 1000" by Richard Burrows,
Wendy Ashby and Ronald Clark, 1992, is now online available:

   http://www.glosa.org/gid/esgl1k.htm .

Many thanks to Wendy Ashby.

A computer-reversed version Glosa-Spanish (not in the book) is:

  http://www.glosa.org/gid/gl1kes.htm .

Like the French list before, this word list needs some (months) work
yet.  There seem to be again a lot of differences and contradictions
to the other Glosa word lists (and so to the GID).

adjustments to my tutor:-


'Mu pa veni a mi civita in Boreo Dakota'

'mu'     'they'    Subject

'pa'     'did'     verb phrase, start of phrase 
'veni'   'come'       * main word of phrase

'a'      'to'      Object noun phrase + preposition
'mi'     'my'           helps main word
'civita' 'city'       * main word
'in'     'in'           helps 'dakota'
'boreo'  'north'          helps next word
'Dakota' 'Dakota'     helps main word

'pa' introduces the verb phrase and signifies the past tense

The English is next to the Glosa, in vertical 
columns rather than horizontal ones, the 
structure in the next one. The reader can 
ignore the latter, skim through it or pore 
over it as wished. I rather like this 
approach myself and would find it helpful 
in learning Spanish for instance.
