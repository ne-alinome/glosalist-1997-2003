*   This is the message I sent on 29th October; possibly I sent it to the
wrong address, resulting in Alberto not receiving it.  There is the
possibility that his messages to me and to the List are coming through, but
messages from me or the List are not getting to him.
    Must admit, being limited to one body is a bit of a bind, though. I'm
waiting 'til cloning is safe, then I'll have, say, another four of me
churned out.  That ought to be enough to allow me to do all of the things I
want to do.
    
    I still have the transposed time sensation, that writing to people in
an amateur language is more of a pre-WW2 fashion; while, with the MAI, WTO
and all that, the present climate seems very anti-altruistic, and very
confrontational, especially with the excessive concentration of wealth
which is occuring.

However, I will try, even harder, to be more friendly,

Robin G.

*   I read the reference, F.A.Q. to Stephen Pinker's "The Language Instinct" put over in another of your posts, and started referring, again to Pinker's book.

Reference:

http://www.clark.net/pub/ogas/evolution/BOOK_FAQ_language_instinct.html


    The particular level of thought organisation I imply when saying "Language of thought" is captured in Pinker's broad concept, 'Mentalese.'

    Pinker, while acknowledging that we do not always put our mental experience

into speakable words, does suggest that, when it is our intention to make a meaningful utterance, we do seem to assemble various groupings of symbols/concepts/memories at the unconscious level, and organise them into "fuzzy" collections of thought (or pre-utterance) so that they can readily be projected outside our bodies using the spoken/written language we have been taught (or choose to use for that particular utterance).


    I quote:-


 Is language  No.  ...... 

 the same as    Pinker suggests that the language of thought is "mentalese,"

  thought?    then reframes the question as to whether mentalese is the

              same as language.  He points out that we could never learn

              language in the first place unless we first had some

              pre-existing "mentalese" to translate into language.

                Pinker knocks the infamous Sapir-Whorf theory of linguistic

              determinism  .....

                Pinker turns to contemporary cognitive science's "physical

              symbol system hypothesis" that all thinking must be the

              manipulation of representations by a processor to frame the

              evidence supporting the claim that English cannot be the

              language of thought.


    So, English is not 'the language of thought', but I toy with the idea: might one of the spoken languages approximate more closely to this "physical symbol system" than does any other spoken language?

    If the "manipulation of representations" can be related, in any way, to the production of spoken language, then I imagine that Glosa *manipulates* its *representations* in a way that is fairly parallel to the way "mentalese" marshalls the concepts we intend to project into speech.

         

    Needless to say, if such parallelism between pre-speech thought and produced language is possible, then it might not, indeed, be an altogether good thing.  Also, it might point to Glosa's outstanding lack of success in the real world.  

    In my time with Glosa, I have become aware that it is NOT ^soft around the edges^ nor does it allow the usual ^encrustation with soft, warm humanisms^

which abound in the natural languages and in many of the Planned ones, as well.

    So, the Glosa authors did intend to strip the flim and flam from the pedestrian use of language to produce a streamlined, precise (and honest) language for no-nonsense, spoken/written communication: it is possible that they succeeded too well with this objective, and produced a language that 'got inside' the mind of the speaker so well, that it left insufficient scope for the human desire to monitor, mediate, and 'diguise' their intention, prior to projecting thoughts as speech. 


    My bottom line is that thought and speech are distant, and distinct, and probably necessarily so.  Very few humans could cope with the situation where their thoughts automatically displayed themselves through speech: people would feel mentally naked; and Freudian slips would occur in epidemic proportions.


    Thus, I feel we have discovered an extension to Gaskell's Theory of Time:

not only do we need sufficient time, in the reception of spoken language, to allow the mechanisms of perception to keep ahead of the utterance flow; but also, we need sufficient complexity and chunkiness, in the language production process, to allow the speaker to monitor his thoughts well in advance of their utterance as words.


    At one stage, while thinking to myself about Glosa, I came to the conclusion that the authors had wanted to create a language in which communication could be "honest."  Having nurtured this idea for a while, now, I have decided that such a language, in which a spade is really called a "spade," 

is NOT what people want.  The temptation is for me to think that Glosa is ''too

good'' or, perhaps not 'dishonest enough' for the human race.

    No kidding: our leaders use double think, and enforce Political Correctness  

in their daily communications with their citicens; I feel this conclusion, in relation to Glosa, is a realistic one, and not a ^jaundiced view^.

*   I cannot find further reference to the term "ontology" but I guess that you are describing an intellectual system, by which we map out the various relationships between the concepts of things, actions and descriptions .. and then relate these relationships to the words we use to symbolise these concepts.

    I will agree that, when parsing any particular language (for linguistic or computational purposes), we keep within the symbol system of that partcular language.  Though I would add that the idea of an abstract set of symbols to represent meaning - when applied to a "meaning representation system" for computer translation - does get away from an 'analysis' in terms of the source language used, and closer to an approximation of how symbols might be 'manipulated' by the brain .. and, possibly, to an "ontology"(?).


    I suspect that there are two strands of thought here: the 'ontology'  comprising partly of 'parse tree' bits, is an academic construct that allows us to understand, in part, how we construct the fabric of language; alternatively, what is actually going on in the brain, as a largely unknown symbol processing system, can be loosely described as a "language" because it is generally agreed by researchers, that the organisation of thought - prior to the formulation of speech - is fundamentally the same in all humans.

    It is the latter of these ideas that I was referring to, when I imagined Glosa to approximate "the language of thought." 

    My imagined language is much fuzzier than Charles' ontology.

I don't think so, but any language with high regularity must have

just as easily as in Glosa. Basque has a noun phrase order exactly

The point is that thought *can* be more easily communicated,

message, one should not confuse the words with the thought.

The term "mentalese" is not what it first appears.
If you study a painting or music, you will see that words
only stop the thought process. After seeing something,
then it can be described, a very different matter.

I think we agree on these points.

Yes, your guess is good, a lot of work is going into these things now.
It gives real-world knowledge to the computer in a useful form.
It is like a combination of child's dictionary and encyclopedia.

*   So, I suppose I have to ask: in what possible ways - when delivering 

an intellectual dissertation - might Glosa be related to the thinking

process?  If Glosa does not assist in the utterance of thought, to a 

greater degree than do other possible languages, then it is a waste of 

time.

    And can you describe the parameters that bring "comfortableness" in 

language?

I guess we just disagree about this ... I see a language as
"just" a way of *communicating* thoughts between people.
First comes the thought, then the words.

I suppose there are things that can't be communicated in words
at all; arts, other things. So maybe "thoughts" can't really
be split as cleanly as I'd like to think.

Pure laziness! I found that the basic core vocabulary of Occ, both roots and
derivatives, are already 95% known to me in the latinate portion of English.
That makes it almost unbeatable for people with a european language background.

One could still argue that Glosa is superior for non-europeans, and therefore
"better" as a world auxlang. One might argue that it incorporates fewer of
the stereotypical european thought patterns as well, and therefore is really
"better" for thinking-in, which seems to be your contention.

I'd like to see Glosa, Ido, and Occ all become more popular,
and let the public decide which one(s) were "best". Glosa seems
to need the most help, because there is nobody publicizing it.

I want to give a better answer on AUXLANG, but I haven't yet
been able to analyze it properly ... But I am sure that Glosa
"works" and should not be abandoned. The others, Esperanto
and Interlingua, I would rather see die.

And I would like to think, "improving". A good auxlang improves
communication, reduces misunderstanding, brings people together.
We need to prevent World War III, Depression II, and Ecocide I.

I'd hate to see Eo die, because it's the one I can more or less speak.
I think I'd like to see it slowly reform itself.

I think this is a well-intentioned error.  I see a common auxlang as a
sort of linguistic metric system  a useful and valuable thing, but not
at all likely to improve human understanding.  The Yugoslavs mostly
all speak Serbo-Croatian, and the Swiss don't all speak anything.  There
are factors overwhelmingly more important than language.  And for
that matter, would mutual understanding lead to peace or to conflict?

I see your point, and often wonder about it. Despite such exceptions,
I think the tendency is still there: better to argue than not to talk.
But, since I'm both off-topic and unsure, I will drop that subject.

Anyway, I haven't noticed that I think any differently when using
(however well or badly) a language other than English. Others
have said they do, to which I still say hmmm.

   So, in essence, the answer to my question is: "Yes, There is a preferred
order in Verb Phrases, in Italian; and, as in English, the adverb follows
the verb.

    Meanwhile, in all of your above examples of variation, in Italian, the 
Verb[infl.] moiety has also been 'set.'  This might suggest that verb
inflection is the mode for the wide range of usage within Italian-language
sentences.

*   Spot on.  This is the answer I was seeking.  Thank you.
    It would seem that having a Tense particle separate from the Verb-
Infinitive, in Italian, is not a major usage.
    In only two of the first eight versions, did the Adverb precede the
Verb, suggesting that this structure is a minority one, in Italian;
similarly, only in versions Eight and Nine, did the "particlisation" of
Tense come up.
    What is especially interesting, from the Glosa point of view, is that
the Ninth, and final, version is the one that 'maps onto' Glosa's syntactic
pattern.
  It.   "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via"
  Gl.   ~An pa hedo kurso longo u via.~
  Eng.  "He did happily run along the road."
           \_T.__Mod.__V._/
              Verb Phrase

    My first guess is that Glosa sentence formation will be harder for
Italians than for English speakers; because, as well as both languages
having mixed syntactic forms, each with the tendency to place the Verb
before the Adverb, 
Italian-language also is more inflected than English.

*   So, this location, in Italian, of Modifiers (Adverbs and Adjectives)

confusion, for the average Italian learner of languages, will it cause, to
ask him/her to learn Glosa?

*   Yes, the special case of the "Orso bruno" does point to one of the
severe problems with trying to form an 'International language'.  Without
solving the problem, I will sidestep it, by looking, again, to see three
brown dogs.
    The crux of the matter was the idea of having a set rule of syntax in
Glosa.  I am curious to know how hard it will be for someone who "thinks in
Italian" to also learn to "think in Glosa."
    Which reminds me: is the "veloci", which relates to the ~celero~,
modifying the "run" or the "bears"?  According to Glosa's rules of syntax,
~celero~ precedes the substantive "noun", ~ursus~, and so Modifies it
(=Adjective, in Eng.): we end up with "fast bears." 
   
   To quickly finish this part of the story, I would like to explain what
"Head Final" phrase structure means in Glosa.
   "Head final" is a decription of a phrase in which the major concept-word
is the last word in the phrase, with all of the specifying, colouring and
modifying words coming before it.

  NOUN PHRASE  .............................  VERB PHRASE .........

  Andro _____________________________________ kurso.
  [man]  ...................................  [runs]

  Un andro __________________________________ fu kurso.
  [the man]  ...............................  [will run]
 
  Un alti andro _____________________________ fu posi kurso.
  [the tall man]  ..........................  [will possibly run]

  Un alti melano-ge-kapila andro ____________ fu posi tosto kurso.
  [the tall black-haired man]  .............  [will possibly soon run]

  Un alti melano-ge-kapila, no-intelige andro fu posi tosto celero kurso.
  [the tall black-haired un-intelligent man will possibly soon quickly run]

What have I tried to do?
~andro~ is the "noun" and is always the final word of the NOUN PHRASE. 
~kurso~ is the "verb" and is always the final word of the VERB PHRASE.

~U(n)~ is the determinant, indicating the next Substantive word will
function s a Noun.
~fu~ is the Tense Particle, indicating the next Substantive word will
function as a Verb.

~alti~ is a Numerator (of size), and has low semantic value, so is next in
importance after the Determinant.
~posi~ is a Verboid - adding only a little information to the operation of
the "verb", and is second in importance to Tense.

~melano-ge-kapila~ is a descriptive modifier adding a bit more info to our
picture of the man, so is closer the the "noun" than the Numerator, ~alti~.
~tosto~ another Verboid, adds some urgency to the story, and so is closer
to the "verb" than the less specific Verboid, ~posi~.

~no-intelige~ is a high-level Modifier; and, of the Modifiers, adds most to
our _understanding_ of the man, so goes closest to the "noun" ~andro~.
~celero~, of the Verb Modifiers, gives us most information of _how_ the man
will run, and so goes closest to the "verb", ~kurso~.

Although the Glosa authors never said it, there is a fairly well-defined
order for the placement of Modifiers before both "nouns" amd "verbs".  This
sequence is directly related to the semantic significance of the Modifiers,
having the low-level Modifiers furthest from the Substantive they modify,
and the most meaningful Modifiers just preceding the Substantives they
modify ... with intermediate Modifiers located, in rising significance,
between the least and most significant. 

   Amazingly, in the Functional Grammar used to describe how English works,
Linguists have spelled out that the same situation also applies to
Modifiers preceding English-language nouns; these nouns, also being the
last words in Noun Phrases, qualify the phrases as being "Head final".

Not so.  There's a difference in meaning between 1-7 and 8-9:

1-7 are in 'passato remoto' (remote past, past perfect?) tense
('corse' indicating past perfect, 3rd person singular);

8-9 are in 'trapassato remoto' tense. This tense indicates an action
which is past respect to another past action. 'Aveva' is the imperfect
tense of the auxiliary verb 'essere' (to be), (3rd person, singular),
and 'corso' is the past participle of 'correre', and it is invariant.

Yes, I understand that this cannot be clear from this description.

Yes, but there's a difference in meaning between 1-7 and 8-9. They are
used in different circumstances.

The 'passato remoto' (1-7) is not used much in speech (except in
sicilian), and even in writing is being used less and less, and
nowadays it sounds formal.  I used it to translate the glosa phrase
because it offer a sense of completeness of the action.  Other tenses
requires a context to make sense.

Ok. But the italian here means rather: He had happily...

BTW, in tense-table there's the following example:

       An pra vide                He had seen
       An pra-du vide             He had been seeing

The word 'pra' however is not defined anywhere else.  Is this a
misspelling for 'pre'?


Now, the meaning of "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via" should
be something like:

An pre pa hedo kurso longo u via.


or:  past      t2    t1                    now                     future
      <--------+-----+----------------------+------------------------>

Phrase 9 refers to someone which at time t1 had runned at time t2.

I don't think that word order is a problem. Lack of inflections may be.

Apart:

The following is an excerpt from an Internet Oracle response that I
read recently. It is intended to be humorous, but nevertheless shows
the kind of confusion that arises frequently in english:

# The Internet Oracle has pondered your question deeply.
# Your question was:
# 
# > Benevolent in temperament is the Oracle,
# >
# > Why are there still trees?
# 
# And in response, thus spake the Oracle:
# 
# } There aren't.  What a ridiculous question.  Everybody knows stills
# } don't grow on trees.  They mutate from abandoned car radiators.
# }
# } Oh, wait, my apologies.  You meant why are the trees not moving around.
# } What a silly language this is.

----------------------------------------------------------------

Now you understand why people is suspicious when a conlang is too
similar to english?   8-)

I don't think that the order of words is a problem, at least if nouns,
verbs, adjectives etc. can be easily recognized.  But IMHO the
difficulty is that non inflected languages are harder to parse, since
they offer less hints. On the other hand, they may be easier to learn.

The bears.

In italian 'veloci' is an adjective (and the ending -i indicates
plural, so it aids the parsing), and so it modifies the noun.  The
corresponding adverb is 'velocemente':

"I tre orsi bruni corsero velocemente nel parco."     
"Velocemente i tre orsi bruni corsero nel parco."     
"I tre orsi bruni corsero nel parco velocemente."     
"I tre orsi bruni velocemente corsero nel parco."     

(here velocemente modifies the verb)

...

BTW, 'tosto' is also an italian word (old fashioned, but
comprehensible).

IMO, if that a common language exists, it is way lower level than the
natural languages we speak consciously.  

In my to do list there is also the task of reading something about
this topic.

I did not mean to imply that modern italian is better than old

Maybe that languages like Glosa will be more universally

Do you mean schools which teach English as a foreign language, or
schools for native speakers?

Most of the native English speakers have an abysmal knowledge of their
language.  Look at the following message, recently posted in

I'm a student at the University of Illinois. I am writing a paper for my

Are their usages that have changed over the years? Become obsolete? Are
their new phrases popping up?
----------------

This guy is an universitary level student in some field which regards
linguistic, and still he doesn't know the difference between 'there'
and 'their'.  How many americans do know their language grammar? maybe
the top 1%?

I even found serious misspellings in books published by prestigious
publishers. (Typical is 'principle' for 'principal')

As far as I know, English is the only language in which this happens
regularly.

But we were talking about auxlangs, and I ended up bashing English.  8-)

IMHO, yes.  The more grammar there is, the better.   8-)

Seriously. Grammar, if free of the historical incrustations that
natural grammars usually have, is an help, not an impediment, IMHO.

Maybe you mostly liked the easy pronunciation rules?

How long does it takes a travel by ship from Australia to England?

Funny.  I have a german friend, I'll tell her this story.

All of the proposed IAL I have seen so far seem very easy to learn,
but, of course, you cannot force people to learn a language.

If an auxlang becomes widespread, the people will *want* to learn it.

Why do you think people around the world learn english?  Because of
the beauty of this language? (NO!)

In my case, I wanted to peruse the scientific literature which is only
available in English. (BTW, I only know English as a written
language. I can't speak it except for a few very basic words, and
certainly I don't understand a word of spoken english).

Well, yes, but nevertheless something I have learned from this list.

BTW, Glosa indeed sounds nice to the ear.

Often the double meaning of a sentence is not evident to the
writer. If I see in my writing a phrase that can be read in different
ways, I try to disambiguate it. But If I don't realize that a phrase
can be read in a way different from what I had in mind, I cannot do
anything to clarify.

Another example of confusion (the example is from an article on
Interlingua on the web):

  'The International Auxiliary Language Society'

What's international the language or the society?

This is not a contrived example, I have found real cases like this one
in which I don't understand the meaning.

In Glosa I guess this could be resolved by using hypens to join
related words, but what if the writer does not realize that the phrase
is ambiguous (after all, he *knows* what's international)?

In English, one could call his society:

    'The International Society for Auxiliary Languages'  or
    'The Society for the International Auxiliary Language'

but usually won't.

You bet.

I think it's just a question of efficiency.  It's true that kids
learns perfectly their native language even without a written grammar,
but it takes them 10 years or more.

Saluta!

Hm...

Pity your word list doesn't allow one to say, "The silence is eerie."

That sentence came to mind, somehow.

Kindly translate:

"She went to the shop to shop for a dress and other things and when
she returned shop worn in the dress worn once found she had left
the other shopping in the shop."

Cheers...

Daniel, I didn't expect to find you here.  Take care of yourself, man.
Just possibly, you are working too hard.  Just possibly, simultaneous
involvement with every language on earth is not something you can do
without affecting your health.  You probably have better things to do.

In short, in the friendliest possible way:  Get a life!

--Mike

P.S. I meant "profound". :-)

I suggest you give 20 minutes minimum to Glosa study every day.
It's like exercise, necessary to avoid degeneration ...
what a happy thought, not! And study a different aspect each day.

I have found some confirmation for my observation that reading at slow speed

Maybe there's something to Robin's "clarity of thought" argument,
more than meets the eye. Or else Glosa attracts the brightest people?

  The question of the Old Glosa ~pra~, which was current at the time I posted the Tense Table, but has since been withdrawn by the authors, 

is a tricky one.  I suspect that ones decision depends on ones position on the _conformist---pragmatist_ spectrum.  While I TRY to fit in with everything the Glosa authors say, I have to remember, that, like me, they are mortal; and, that, out there, there is the world of humanity, which will change language to suit its needs, generation after generation anyway!

  The above is a 'bare-bones', non-exhaustive precis of the position of both Glosa and English in relation to pastness.

  For me, personally, the facility to express the "deep past" is a part of my psyche; and, so, I refuse(?) the advice of Paul Bartlett, to drop the archaic Glosan term ~pra~, which, I feel, has 'functional life.'

*   English has similar archaisms: Glosa is not supposed to.  However, when translating a natlang archaism into Glosa, we would probably find a way of conveying the 'old world' flavour.  Both English and Italian have found specialised usages to convey unusual time and semantic relationships.


>> What is especially interesting, from the Glosa point of view, is

>> It.   "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via" 

>> Gl.   ~An pa hedo kurso longo u via.~

>> Eng.  "He did happily run along the road."

>> 

>> ......... \_T.__Mod.__V._/

>

>Ok. But the italian here means rather: He had happily...

>

*   Caught by the old Perfect Past, again; thus, none of the examples you gave, it seems, 'map' directly onto Glosa.


>BTW, in tense-table there's the following example:

>

>       An pra vide                He had seen

>       An pra-du vide             He had been seeing

>

>The word 'pra' however is not defined anywhere else.  Is this a

>misspelling for 'pre'?

>

*   This anomoly is explained above.  I retain it for both history and sanity.  Perhaps I have been cowardly, in retaining it in the Tense Table, while not coming straight out, and putting it in the Glosa 6000

ammended list.

  EG Pre na grupa pa gene ad un akro, an pra skendo u monta.

 [before our group did get to the top he had ascend the mountain]   

  Before our group got to the top, he had ascended the mountain.


>Now, the meaning of "Lui aveva felicemente corso lungo la via" should

>be something like:

>

>An pre pa hedo kurso longo u via.

>

* [he before did happily run along the road] *   NOT good Glosa!

   Before, he ran happily along the road.  

 OK in vernacular English, after the syntactic re-arrangement, but the ~pre~ is really an elided preliminary phrase, ~Pre nu,~.


Better either as:-

    An pra hedo kurso longo u via.  

  [he had happily run along the road]

....  Though this form tends to demand the 'closer past' event against which the 'earlier past' one is compared.


or,

    An pa previo hedo ....

  [he did previously happily .... 


or, eliding the ~pa~, 

    An previo hedo kurso .... 

   [he previously happily run ....

   He previously ran happily ....


  If this chap ran along the road twice, once happily, the second time, otherwise, we might want to invoke something "like" the Past Perfect Tense to convey the time differential; and, I would judge Glosa to be a lesser language, if it could not make this discrimination ... through tense.  I vote-with-my-pen to revive the Old Glosa form, PRA. 



>or:  past      t2    t1                    now                     future

>      <<--------+-----+----------------------+------------------------>

>

>Phrase 9 refers to someone which at time t1 had runned at time t2.

>

*   Yes.


   End Part the First.


Saluta,


Robin

Boni di, Mi Plu Amika,

Prima, un obesi-pe pa gene ge-kapti intra u janua inter plu karpento bi e tri.  Sekunda, il es u fo no-gluko-abili afaire de M. Distard; qi pa kad ex u treno, proxi Torino: an morta pa sto u treno pro tet-ze minuta, tem plu polica pa dice-qestio plu viagia-pe.


  E pre u-la, intra u bara, Bill e Mari Aktopa pa trakto un imuni-korda te sto u treno: mu akti so, ka bi andra pa du pugna alelo, iso mu sio kausa noku ad alelo. Mu pa trakto u korda tem u treno pa du kine dia u tunela infra plu Alpa; e pre un alexi-pe pa kausa paca - e u treno pa kontinu id kine - holo plu viagia-pe pa gene pato ex plu fumi.  Kron id ki ex u tunela, u holo treno pa du tusi; u treno alexi-pe pa suspekta plu Aktopa de uno mali akti.  Mo de plu pugna andra pa gene ge-remove, ex u treno, to u seqe stationa.


  Tem an memo plu-ci previo eveni, Smit re-memo vide u ge-remove viagia-pe dice ko u blond ju-fe; nu intra six-penta.  Imedia, an pa ki retro ad u bara te dice qestio u sekunda de plu pugna andra.  Gene pusi auxi ex an, Smit re-ki a karpento tetra, intra qi sed Angela Celi; kompleti no-moti.  La, an pa itera sto u treno - per trakto un imuni korda - e pa atende un un ariva de un imuni-pe.  An ski: id pa e es tem pro an te revela an veri funktio epi u treno ... iso un imuni-pe pro u Sultani de Brunei; e ke an nece monstro an ge-grafo autori-ra te kontrolo u treno, si ali no-usu eveni; qi sio pote involve u Sultani, acide.


  U treno imuni-pe pra nuli-tem vide u tali dokumenta, sed an pa acepta id, e qestio Smit de an tende.  U skema pa es te arive to Roma iso tosto iso posi.  U treno fu kontinu kine, sine sto to ali stationa inter Torino e Roma.


  E, nuli: Smit ne pote revela u persona de u Sultani, klu anti u treno imuni-pe vo habe u-ci info.  Plu qestio pa deniora: qo-pe pa kausa u morta de Celi; per qad metode, e pro qad rationa?


CI SMIT PETITIO TU AUXI:

 1. Qad pa es u relatio inter Angela Celi e u Sultani?

 2. Pro qad rationa, Madame Aktopa vo habe mo de plu pugna andra ge-remove ex u treno?

 3. Pro qad rationa Viktor Logor, u famo joiel klepti-pe, pa sed intra u homo karpenta iso Mmle. Celi?

 4. Qad es u afaire de u xeno andra intra sedi-mo bi-sept de karpento tri; e qe, pa es u gleba, intra an tegu-ve, u pistola?

 5. Un obesi-pe; qi pa gene ge-kapti intra u janua, habe familiari.  Qe, an es qo-pe; e, es an epi u treno ka u Sultani?

 6. Qe, Distard pa kade, alo gene ge-pulsa?  Qo-pe sio habe an exit u treno?

 ... e pluso ...

 7. Qe, tu habe ali idea de un persona; qi pa kausa u morta de u blond?
