*  Nice idea, Kevin.
   I would rather see it as research into new subject matter: a tutorial
written by Sid, me, or anyone else.
   But I am not in favour of rehashing the "18 Steps to Fluency in Glosa."
I would rather leave this historical work in the archive area, and not play
around with it.
   This suggestion, of going through a current attempt to use Glosa, does
appeal to me.  It reminds me of the way I used to do amateur teaching of
English to Asians: I would ask someone to volunteer a sentence; then I
would write it on the white-board exactly how they said it; next, I would
ask the other learners for suggestions on ways of improving it.

*  OK, if vocabulary does come first, then this gives us an urgent reason
for getting a standardised lexicon, so that spelling ceases to be a
"variable."
   The different people who present tutorials might use different levels of
vocabulary - Mega Glosa, Core Glosa and Mini Glosa - so, it seems obvious
to me that the whole lexicon ought to be standardised prior to commencing
the 'debugging' of one, or more, tutorials.
   I certainly would be prepared to work on the basis of accepting the GID
as it stands.  However, with the inputs from Wendy and Marcel in
straightening out the last few ambiguities, I would suggest that this
revision be completed before tutors are written.
   On the qustion of Mini Glosa, or Glo, as you appropriately abbreviate
the name, it looks like it is going to be an accepted starter vocab
variant, rather than a standard-setting renewal of the whole lexicon.  EG
~do~ rather than ~domi~
   My feeling, seeing Glo from the perspective of the "Three Bears,"
suggests that a tutor written using the present Glo vocab would be a bit
hard on the reader.  I suspect that Glo needs a bit of fleshing out: the
ribs are showing through; it feels just a bit lean for comfort.  Maybe it
ought to be 600 words rather than 500.

Saluta,

Robin

   Yes, the question of the ultimate utility of an IAL definitely comes in
here.  However, I suspect that a standard "test," of all contenders for
global adoption, presented by 'authorities' like Linguists and UN
Professor, will be to translate some difficult poem.  I was challenged in
this way while on the Conlang Mailing list.

*  Being a 'creative' myself, I might have trouble with the idea of making
Glosa so boringly repetitive that it puts off other creatives.
   To get Glosa off the sliprails, I feel we need all the brains we can
get.  There is a danger that the more 'sensible' it get, then the less fun
it is.

*  Ron Clark was forever saying this, too: I found it an extremely
uncomfortable way of being creative.  Having a very tight vocabulary, while
it might bring out the best in some creatives, can be extremely daunting
for the non-creative reader, who is unable to match the mind of the
creative writer.
   I never did know if Ron was rationalising the use of Glosa 1000 - for
printing/postage reasons; or if he sincerely thought that there was a
danger of spoon-feeding IAL-users, by giving them too many words to play
with.  I would say that you can go over the top, and have words and
inflections for everything, as Esperanto does, thus over-stretching the
learning task.  And, I can see the great value in providing learners with a
suitable Mini-type Glosa.  Also, I do know that Ron Clark was quite serious
- and, I feel, correct - when he said that we don't have to say everything
in total detail, because the listener, or reader, goes halfway towards the
speaker, or writer, to understand what is being said.
   We are again ^trying to hit the happy medium^ between a 'dry,' terse
language, and a warm and fuzzy, verbose one.

   No Kevin, I suspect that you missed the ^fine print^: the hyphen, I
fear, was lost beside the tilde.
   When I said "abbreviation" I was not giving a blanket approval for "ge"
to replace "gene", I was referring to the specific case of
compound-building, using "ge-" ... in the same way that, in Mega Glosa,
"-pe" is an abbreviation for "persona", and "-do" is for "domi."

   But I would ask: do people say Glosa sentences to themselves, either out
loud, or in their heads, before committing them to type?
   What I'm getting at is the very un-Linguistic quality of "feel."
   When we come up with a sentence in our native language, we usually know,
instantly, if it 'feels' right, or not .. regardless of grammatical
correctness.
   Without wishing to be too innovative, I would suggest that a ^well
turned^ Glosa sentence has a noticably good 'feel' to it, and when we read
it back to ourselves, the intended meaning comes flooding back into our
brain.  Which is as it should be, for Glosa; and as it is, for all native
languages.

*  Fair enough.  For people who learn Glo, and then choose to expand their
vocab, they have an additional level of synonyms (Glo/Glosa).
   And for those who learn Glosa first, and then read something with
distictly Glo constructions, this should not present a great problem.
   I would suspect that ~go~, and any others like it, ought to be included
in the larger dictionary as legitimate abbreviations of the
'interchangeable' variety, as well as being compoundable.

   You have described, above, the use of the shorter forms as full words,
which allows them to form compounds - not as "generics".

   The use of "toy" was not derogatory, but more 'metaphorical.'  However,
I will not use it again: instead, I will attempt to get you to adjust the
range of basic root-words to make Glo more usable; also, I wish to see the
(I can say) derivative language tested through use, and developed as a
result of experience.
   There are precedents, some in sci-fi, of derivative languages that have
persisted where their mother language has become extinct.  While I do not
imagine this to be the prospect for Glo and Glosa, I will be watching
carefully.
   I do have the feeling that the 'Target Population,' which Glo is aimed
at, needs more definition.

    Prompted by your detective work, I have ticked in "Styled Text," the

    While I do not think this will revert everything to plaintext, it will
stop me from trying the optional BOLD, UNDERLINE and ITALICS.

I tend to write Glo/sa sentences first, and then go back
and read them to myself to see if they make sense and
"feel" good. I spend less time improving my Glo/sa
sentences in email messages than I do in documents that I
expect to last a long time. I agree there is an aesthetic
quality that Glo/sa writers should aim for, but I'm not
sure I can (or ever will be able to) describe it.

> *  I still have doubts as to the ability to satisfy

As you hinted in another post, 500 is not an absolute
limit. I originally targeted 600, but when I found the
first draft at 450 words, I reset my goal to 500. If more
roots are needed, more will be added.

I appreciate that. I would accept any of these adjectives
without offense: mini, subset, reduced, stripped down,
simplified, derivative.

I dislike (to varying degrees) the adjectives: toy,
learning version, training wheels, stepping stone.

And I hope to adjust the root words accordingly.

An interesting thought. I see the target as being the same
as most IAL's. Of course, it has different strengths from
other IAL's, and so would be likely to appeal more (or
less) to people with different tastes and backgrounds. I'll
have to think more about this, and probably come up with
some kind of "position statement".

I'm not sure that's necessary. I would hope that any
tutorial would stick to some core vocabulary at least 99%
of the time. In those rare cases where a non-core word was
used, I would hope we could use a substitute word for our
grammar discussions.

I'm not quite sure what you mean here, so perhaps you could
expand on your thought. I hope that Glo will be as close to
a subset of Glosa as possible. To the degree that it is a
subset, I would hope that it could also serve as a "mini
core" lexicon for Glosa.

By the way, I do hope to start work on a Glo tutorial
within the next few weeks. I think it's an important part
of getting people to learn and use Glo. There is some more
important work to do on the word list before I will shift
my attention to the tutorial. However, I am not going to
wait until the word list is "finished", because I plan to
use the tutorial as a test of the language, and will
probably make several vocabulary changes along the way.

I don't yet have any concrete ideas about what form the
tutorial will take.

Kevin

Very interesting. My first reaction is that many people on
the Conlang list have artistic (non-IAL) goals, and for
them a poem would be an excellent way to judge a language.
I'm not sure how relevant it is for selecting an IAL.

Nope. I was thinking more about our past discussions
comparing things along the lines of:

I pressed the 'A' button with my finger.
I fingered the 'A' button.
I buttoned an 'A'
I "A"'d.

So you are saying that ~ge-~ and ~ge~ have different
meanings. The first is a synonym for ~gene~, but the latter
is not. This type of confusion is exactly why I have
reformed the generics in Glo.

Unless and until I learn something new, I will continue to
have the following Glo words:
~ge~: get (become), become, passive voice indicator
~gene~: get (obtain), obtain, receive

Feedback is always appreciated.

Kevin

I had a notion that "gene" might become a verb particle that told us that the 
object phrase was before the verb and that the subject was elsewhere or 
missing and that "ge" turned the following word into an adjective ( no hyphen 
needed)
U ci pa gene grafo nu-di (per/ex mi)

U ci ge grafo poesi pa es in PGN.

there follows a pause from me separated from my puta-me ................

As I understand it ~ge~ is not a word in Glosa, but
only a prefix (ie ~ge-~ {with hyphen}).

~gene~ is a word in Glosa meaning -
            "get, receive, acquire, become or obtain" 
               a "thing, quality or state"

Subject: [glosalist] TriBrunoZoa 0.3  Edited -->  0.3A
From: Robin Gaskell <rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au>

--=====================_1015516558==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Mi Plu Amika,
  Here is an edited version of my earlier attempt to casting the first
third of the _Tri Ursus_ story into Glo.

  It seems to be working.

  The Bears' house is at the end of the path, which does not simply pass by
their home.

  I have gone along with most of Kevin's suggested alterations, but
probably wish to retain responsibility for both Glosa and Glo renditions.

  Needless to say the original, possibly Evanescent - if not Old -
 Glosa version of _Tri Ursus_ will come up for review, soon.  I would guess
that this ought to be an exercise for all on Glosalist.  It could possibly
be edited in parts, as is being done with the Glo version.  Any suggestions?

  In the Glo version, we changed the season from Spring to Autumn.

  I would like to see 'equal and opposite action' in Glo, so suggest a
"push" to balance Glo's "pull" of ~tira~ or ~trakto~.  It could be GID's
either ~impakti~ or ~pulsa~, but I favour the archaic Old Glosa ``peli``.
The Latin dictionary mentions  impello  and  expello  as well as  impulsus
among its renditions of "push."

  Closing things .. as well as having them open [Glo:aperi] .. seems also
in need of being covered - possibly with ~klude~.

  A bit of soft usage comes with the easy-to-say ~in qi~, whereas, as Kevin
Points out, ~intra qi~ is the '''correct''' form.  I first noticed such
?slackness? when it came from the Glosa authors; however, I decided that
this must be another of their intuitions about the rounding-off effect of
usage over time.  So, while ~intra qi~ [inside which], is the correct form,
the average Glosa speaker is more than likely to 'lose' the rest of the
word, and soften it to the more-easily-said, but incorrect, ~in qi~ [into
which].

  I look forward to seeing the adjusted version of the Glo vocab.

Still TriBrunoZoa 0.3-->1 to go,

Robin Gaskell
  P.S. I think mu Eudora has been corrupted, so will muddle through,
sending "plaintext" and "Attachments" as well as I can. R.

GID 'peli' nu semani ~fur, pelt~. Seqe-co, mi no amo peli.

Posi 'pelo'? Anti-co, 'pulsa' es intra GID, seqe-co mi

Fo stimula. Glo nu habe mo verba 'intra'. Posi, mi debe

Yes.

In 18 Steps ~in~ is intended to mean just in or
inside and into is ~ad-in~. ~intra~ means
indoors or inside.

I think ~in~ meaning into is now Old Glosa.

From: "Marcel Springer" <m.springer{at}nikocity{dot}de>
Date: Fri, 8 Mar 2002 17:51:41 +0100


A dictionary update: 

* Now ALL items from the "Similar Synonyms"-list are taken into 
  consideration.  Most of these inconsistencies are removed now.  

(Of course I made errors with that.  Some decisions were not easy and 
certainly I made the wrong hit sometimes, though I tried hard to 
respect Wendy's wishes.  The problem with the final vowel is now mainly 
solved, although final vowels remain difficult to memorize for me, but 
that may belong because I am coming from a language that has lost most 
of its final vowels.) 


Other news: 

* ali/uno-problem solved, corrected and cleared.  Thanks to Wendy
  Ashby and Nick Hempshall for their help.
* The list of "Useful Prefixes" (book "Central Glosa", p. 74-75) 
  is now completely included.  You can have a look at them in 
  English-Glosa, search under "P"
  ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/engl.htm#gep ) for "prefix".
* The list of technology words (newspaper "Plu Glosa Nota", No. 86, 
  p. 6) is now included.  Now there are official words for internet, 
  e-mail and file (computer). 
* Formatting routine changed: In English-Glosa now the prefereable 
  Glosa word comes first.  The expired ("X") words are only in 
  Glosa-English and not any longer in English-Glosa. 
* Few things from Kevin's Core-list, although I did not work through it 
  systematically yet.  Thanks to Kevin for providing a raw-text-version 
  on his website.

So your distinction is that if you ~gene~ an adjective, you
become it, but if you ~gene~ a noun, you receive it. Right?

But what about: ~Mi pa gene piro.~

Did I obtain some fire (in a safe, controlled way), or did
I burst into flames?

Or ~Mi pa gene aqa.~

Did I receive some water (in a safe, controlled way), or
did I get wet?

  The flower was give(n) by the man.(*?)

   I am not sure that ~u dona flori~ is:-  a given flower

                                       or  a give flower*

   But I do know that a got-give flower .. u ge-dona flori
uses the normal 'verb', ~dona~, as a participle, with the function of an
adjective.

   However as I still understand it, ES and GENE while not being supposed
to be confused with one another, are supposed to be interchangeable in
their 'VERB' function. 
EG
  ~U janu nu es ge-klude: id pa gene ge-klude pa-di.~
[the door now is got-close, it did get got-close past-day]
   The door is now closed: it got closed yesterday.

The alternative, minus the "ge-" participle-forming prefix, is:-

  ~U janu nu es klude: id pa gene klude pa-di.~
[the door now is close, it did get close past-day]
   The door is now closed: it got closed yesterday.

This second form is:
    . a lot easier to say;
    . the present 'standard';
    . understandable in most everyday contexts; but
    . not as exact as the now defunct construction. 

** Needless to say, I feel that the extra grammar loading, of using a
short, particle-forming prefix, is a small price to pay for those who
understand the subtlty of the passive voice, and want to use it in their
utterances: a price they would happily pay for the certainty that others
understood their intention to use the Passive.
   
>1. drop GENE and instead use ES (for the passive voice)
*  No.  I sometimes feel the need to differentiate between "getting" and
"being."

>2. keep GE but also use DU (for the pair of participles)

*   ~Tu es du-morta.~     Act thingo, Scene whatever, "Julius Caesar"   
   [thou be ing-die]
     You are dying.

    ~An pa es ge-morta.~  Act thingo, Scene later, "Julius Caesar"
    [he did be get-dead]
     He was killed.
                                MAYBE

What about:-
     ~Vide! An gene ge-morta!~   Plebian at scene of crime: same play
    [see, he become get-dead]
      See! He gets killed!
and:-
     ~Ki ad u Kapitol, nu-di, e tu fu es du gene morta.~
   [go to the Capitol now-day, & thou will be -ing get dead]
     Go to the Capitol, to-day, and you are getting killed.

    B. and C. I go along with.

How about:-

 [a flower did get give to Jo]  OR  [a flower had be give to Jo]
  A flower was given to Jo.         A flower had been given to Jo.

AND
  To u-la momenta, u flori pa du es gene dona a Jo.
 [at that moment, a flower did cont. (to)be get give to Jo]
  At that moment, a flower was being given to Jo.

**  The problem is with the VERB PHRASE.
    I continue to work on the principle that there is a fairly
well-determined 'good syntax' sequence of word-functions within the Verb
Phrase.
    If Glosa has a "Head Final" phrase structure (most significant word
last), and I think this is the only conclusion from observation of PGN and
other prose from Glosa Central, then, we might ask if there is a gradual
rise in significance of the words from start to end of each Verb Phrase. 
    A suggested significance sequence could be ...

Neg. Simple Aspect/ Function Modifier(s) Verboid Substantive Auxillary
part tense   Mood    'verb'   <adverbs>             'verb'    'verb'
      part.  part.
EG
 ne    fu     sio      es       tako       pote      ki         apo

   So, in the excitement of the story, this would flow:-

   Tem u teri-kausa melano ursus pa tenta vora un andra, an undu u du piro
brancha ante id.  An ski ke an amika pa tenta sti u dina-me de mu vagona
pro mu eskapa; e, iso tosto de an pote audi u soni de u dina-me, an sio

   An kredi ke kron mu pa es intra u moti vagona, mu fu sio es tako pote ki
apo.
   Sed kron u dina-me pa sto, mu ne sio es pote tako ki apo, e un ursus pa
du kursi ad u ge-sto vagona ...

**  More work is needed: there are some alternative sequences - as in
English; however, Verb Phrases do seem to have a pattern of sequences   -
as has already been demonstrated with Noun Phrases, which have a simpler
structure. 
 
Saluta,

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sat, 9 Mar 2002 12:40:13 -0800 (PST)

I'm trying to get this straight in my mind (and in the Glo
word list).

According to GID:

~de~ is: about; belong; concerning; from; in relation to;
of; of (concerning); relating to; than

~ex~ is: out from; by (marker of doer by passive voice);
ex-; from; out; since

In particular, note that "from" appears in both lists. I'm
trying to figure out how to describe how someone would
choose one over the other.

It seems that ~ex~ is used for authorship and emergence
(the crew came out of the ship).  

It also has "out", like ~u ex-urba area~ (the area outside
the city). Normally I would expect that to be ~extra~, but
I suppose this is an abbreviation. Perhaps in Glo I could
combine ~ex~ and ~extra~, like I am considering with ~in~
and ~intra~.

This list implies that it would also be used for an
ex-employee (someone who used to be an employee), which I
guess is related to the "since" that is listed. But those
two don't seem to fit the rest of the definition. In ~mi pa
ze vora ex pa-di~, why would this use ~ex~?

I guess it's like I haven't eaten "outside" yesterday.
Seems like a metaphorical stretch. And we have "po" which
seems better anyway.

Now, ~de~ is for belonging (like a dog _of_ mine), and
concerning (like a book _concerning_ food). The "than"
merely seems to reflect that ~de~ fills in where no other
little word fits, like in ~ma sito de~. 

I suppose if I say I "_am_ from Seattle", that would imply
a belonging, rather than a trip origination point, and so
would be ~de~. So I guess we have:

~mi pa veni _ex_ u Texas~
I came from Texas (Texas was my location)

~mi es _de_ u Texas~
I am from Texas (Texas is my affiliation)

They are major case markers, even if "Glosa has no grammar".
DE = genitive, EX = ablative, IN = locative, AD = dative.
They are also major derivational prefixes. Lots of fun.

Ogden's Basic English used the English phrasal verbs
in a similar fashion, to minimize vocabulary. Why not
just relex BE to NT Greek and call it Glo-lite?

Ah, this was actually helpful, because it steered me to
some good websites via google. I now have this map, which
is probably not entirely accurate, but which helps me see
how we got from "there" (Latin) to "here" (Glosa):

nominative: [no marker] (i see=mi vide)
accusative: [no marker] (you hit me=tu bate mi)
vocative: [no marker] (sir, please sit=an, place sedi)
genitive: de (my tool = ru de mi)
ablative: ex (written by mi = grafo ex mi)
locative: in (live in town=eko in urba)
          tem (sleep at night=somni tem noktu)
          a (start at noon=proto a meso-di)???
dative: a/ad (give it to me=dona id a mi)
        pro (do it for her=akti pro fe)
instrumental: per (cut with a knife=seka per seka-ru)

I still don't see where this ont fits in:
     de (more than three=ma de tri)

This is good news. I am going through my Glo list and
updating it as necessary to keep it as close to GID as
possible.

Some of the renamed words are interesting. I am up to the
"P"s, and so far these Glo words have been affected:
 levo -> laevo
 ludo -> ludi
 materi -> materia
 nexi -> nexu
 nume -> numera

I assume the earliest entry starts with "l" because GID
changes were done alphabetically, and earlier GID revisions
were already reflected in my Unofficial Core and Glo lists.

I'm a bit surprised by laevo (which was changed in GID last
October, and I just hadn't realized it). The new version is
harder to pronounce, and is a bit closer to 'lava' than I
would prefer. But 'levo' might be confused with levitate,
so I can see some benefit as well.

I'm slightly disappointed that three of these (laevo,
materia, numera) involved replacing shorter, simpler words
with longer versions. 

When I get to the end of the Glo list, I'll report on
whatever remaining words had to change. I assume this is of
some interest to any Glosa-pe, because the Glo words are
sort of like a mini-sub-core list of Glosa words.

I assume this is still a work in progress. 

Also, I noticed that there are some entries in glen that
are not alphabetical.

The way I see it, is that ~de~ starts off
meaning "belonging to", "of" and "from".

Compare - the man _of_ la Mancha.

Then moves on to cover "concerning", 
"in relation to" and "about".

Compare Cicero's works -
 De Legibus (On the Laws)
 De Officiis (On Duty)
 De Natura Deorum (On the Nature of the Gods)

Then on to cover "than". ~ma de tri~
"more in relation to three".

Saluta,
Nick

PS 

Glosa also has ~ab~ with the meaning "from"

~Mi trena ab London a Paris.~

The only renamed word in the last "half" of the Glo list
was simbola->simboli.

I just posted new Glo lists, which have those few words
renamed to match the GID, and also have many new and
clarified English meanings. I also cleaned up the column
indicating whether a word was 'modified', 'renamed', etc. 

Mostly, I added the 'modified' tag on several words where
the meaning is similar to GID, but where I have omitted a
major part of the definition, or substantially extended the
definition.

Are you sure, we are both talking about engl.htm (English-Glosa)?
If so, I do not understand you.

For instance, when the user is looking for a Glosa word for "goat", he
would find, if I would have used the old program:

"goat  aegi {=egi, prefer kapri} GX; egi {prefer kapri} G; hirkus
        {prefer kapri} G; kapra {=kapri} 1X; kapri 1++"
        
This was ugly and difficult to survey.  He received several meanings
first, which he should not use.  Some of them are really bad and
expired.  Now he gets:

"goat             kapri 1++; egi (prefer kapri) G;
                   hirkus (prefer kapri) G"

The Glosa1000/Core-word comes first, then the Mega Glosa words, and
not any longer error-words like "kapra".  If the new program works
(please report errors to me, that I can fix it), I think it is an
improvement.

When you are talking about glen.htm (Glosa-English), you are right.
This will be a task for the future.



Tu grafo:
 > Ze-ordina verba nu ge-loka po singu de plu-ci verba:

In GID:
 # ...
 # audi-me          speaker (loud-speaker); loud-speaker
 # plu audi-pe 1    audience
 # auge             ...

Of course, these "errors" are intended.  If the user has a text with
"... blablabla plu audi-pe blablabla ..." in it and he does not know
"plu audi-pe", he will not look for "plu audi-pe" but for "audi-pe",
because he thinks, that he knows "plu" as the plural marker already.
And so he should find "plu audi-pe" between "audi-me" and "auge".

About your other examples, "gene u fax - receive a fax" and
"duce fenestra - main window (computer)" we can discuss about.  Does
it say more about "gene" or about "fax", more about "duce" or about
"fenestra"?  I decided for the last ones, because "fax" is stronger
than the empty "gene".  Perhaps I should take in both: "fax [gene u ]"
AND "gene u fax"?

If somebody wants to scan such items and make suggestions for
changing, he can search with his browser in
http://www.glosa.org/gid/engl.txt for the brackets "[".  Thanks in
advance.  Greetings - Marcel

I understand this approach, but still find it uncomfortable
to have some words out of order. Other ways to accomplish
this would be "audi-pe, plu", "(plu) audi-pe", or "audi-pe
(plu)". None of them are very appealing to me either.

I'm not sure here. I think it is really a decision for you
to make, as the owner of the list. In my own Glo list, I
plan to keep it strictly alphabetical, partly because I
don't know how to decide in these cases that could go
either way. It's easier to have one rule and be consistent,
even if the result is sometimes imperfect.

Thanks for pointing this out. It brings up a VERY
interesting Glosa issue, and I would really like to hear
ideas from everyone.

The sentence, as written, has no verb or noun markers,
which is an error on my part. Therefore, it should have
been at least: ~Mi du volu auxi e ze krati~. 

Now, if you KNEW that I ALWAYS use noun markers for my
direct objects (I try to, but certainly do not always
include them), then you could correctly interpret ~auxi~
and ~ze krati~ as infinitive verbs. If I had been asking
for help, I would have said ~Mi du volu u auxi e u ze
krati~.

In the case of ~auxi~, it would seem that it cannot be used
as an intransitive verb, as I tried to do. I intentionally
left off the direct object, because I was trying to help an
abstract situation, more than a specific person. But I
really should have said ~Mi du volu auxi e ze krati tu~.

It never even occured to me when I wrote this sentence that
~auxi~ might be interpreted as a noun. Which leads me to
wonder if perhaps every Glosa sentence should always have
explicit verb and noun markers everywhere, to avoid
confusion. For example:

> ~Mi volu dona auxi, ze krati.~
> I want to (give) help, not to dictate.

This seems to work, except that it could be:
I want gift-help
I want to give help
My desire gives help
My wish-gift helps
...and possibly others

Kevin

My experience in writing English parsers indicates that the best way
is to forget "parts of speech" and focus on what look typographically
like phrases to us (both English and French speakers). In many natlangs
a phrase like your example "want (present tense) to help (infinitive)"
would be a single word.  Glosa's complex syntax and simple morphology
permit elision of tense etc, at the risk of telegraphese ambiguity.
The full canonical form including tense etc is the true "underlying"
Glosa sentence, even when the writer cuts some corners.

*  Plu Amika,
   No P-o-S markers are needed - in my opinion.  All that is required is
good usage, and simple, or, alternatively, clear, sentence construction.

   With well thought-out sentences, or even sentences with well-defined,
and well punctuated, phrase/clause structure, the function of each word
ought to be obvious.

   I am surprised that Charles, with years of using English, did not
peceive the :help: concept as a noun when it was so intended.  If there
might be any confusion, ~un auxi~ should clear the matter up.

Saluta,

Robin

1) ~ne~   (or even ~ja~)
2) ~nu~, ~pa~, ~fu~, ~nu pa~, 
                 ~nu fu~, ~fu pa~, ~pa fu~

9) ~ci~, ~intra~, ~ana~, ~qestio~, ~fobo~ etc
10)  repeat of 7)


With none of the elements being mandatory.

I should point out that it was not Charles who originally
mentioned the confusion. And the fault certainly did NOT
lie with the reader. The problem was that the sentence
itself was confusing.

In this case, I could not put ~u/un~ before ~auxi~, because
I wanted it to be a verb, not a noun. Mentally, I used the
omission of a PoS marker to indicate its verbness.

You suggest adding PoS markers "If there might be any
confusion...". But the problem in this case is that I (the
writer) incorrectly believed that there could not be any
confusion. I really thought I had written an unambiguous
sentence. Now, If I had gone back and thought about it for
five more minutes, perhaps I would have caught my two
errors.

That's the danger of omitting "u" and "nu": As the author
(or speaker), you know what you intend to say, so your mind
can fill in the missing pieces. The reader (or listener)
may have a completely different perspective. Thus, I think
PoS markers (u/plu, pa/nu/fu) should be used in almost all
cases.

There are a few certain words that imply a PoS, and
therefore don't need an explicit one. Pronouns, I think,
can work without u. And I think we have a consensus that
~es~ does not need a pa/nu/fu because it can "only" be a
verb. There may be a few other exceptions, but I can't
think of them right now.

Kevin

So GE is just English -ed, relexed. Naturally it inherits the ambiguity.

So ES is stative and GENE dynamic, like is/get or ser/estar

Yes, but in your message today you took the opposite position.

Rather, "He was dead." To make a killing out of death you need
a causative particle instead of the GE/GENE mess.

Well, there could and should be, but isn't (in G). An auxlang needs
to be both simpler and more rigorously logical than a natlang.

And if zero-marking means verb, then a noun phrase can't use it.
You have found a good counter-example to the elisionist position.

> PoS markers (u/plu, pa/nu/fu) should be used in almost all cases.

Maybe it would be better to call them "phrase indicators",
because G has no POS other than "particles" vs. "full words".
That's why I mentioned the need to parse phrases (not words)
in both English and Glosa. The junctions between verbal and
nominal phrases, especially, must be clearly marked.

That's exactly the way analytic langs work. There's some
blurring of the lines between particle and full-word.
(I just categorize pronouns and auxiliaries as particles.)

I agree, no phrase markers should be mandatory.

Human beings dont speak logic, and a language
that required complete lack of ambiguity would 
be impossible to use correctly.

As a second language for everyone, an IAL needs
to help the users be clear and be understood. So
a variety of means is required -
  syntax rules
  punctuation rules
  compounding rules
  phrase markers
  lack of idiom
  clear definitions for words

Saluta,
Nick

Subject: [glosalist] spain, problem, syntax store
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sun, 24 Mar 2002 14:37:33 EST

just returned from a very interesting visit to Spain.
Lots of food for thought - am trying to catch up with the last flurry on 
Glosalist.

Had a problem last week that has bearings on Glosa.
I needed to make some enquiries in my extremely limited Spanish. What I 
should have done, is to write down in English what I needed to say. Then make 
a store of the words and syntax and from there, sort out the Spanish. 

Here is an attempt ending up with orthodox Glosa.

1) sentence= V, S and O
2) V= simple present tense/ not third person singular/ concept="thought"
3) S= pronoun/ first person singular/ subject
O= clause 2
4) clause2= V2, S2 and O2
5) V2= past tense/ not third...../ concept=" lose"
6) S2=  pronoun/ first person singular/ subject
7) O2= noun/singular/ concept="camera"/modifier=posessed by pronoun
8) pronoun= first p,singular/ adjective


In orth G, phrase order= S V O
(cap M) Mi puta (O=clause2, orth G uses ";" here ) ; (S2 V2 O2)
mi pa lose u mi kamera.

Mi puta; mi pa lose u mi kamera,

to spanish(?) (V S joined) 
Penso que he perdido mi maquina.  ( approx?) 

please sir, did I leave it here?

clause= YesNoQuestion V S O X
V= past tense/ not 3rd sing/  concept="lose"/ modifier="here" 
S= pronoun
pronoun= 1st sing subject
O= pronoun
pronoun= 3rd sing object
X= polite request/ polite address masc
X(saluta signior) YNQ(qe) S(mi) V(pa u-ci lose) O(id) X(place) (?)

Yes. I agree. The syntactic analysis is correct here.
But I have some problems with the resultant Glosa.

~puta~  - this is the word for calculated, logical
          thought. I would guess that it was
          your belief or opinion
          rather than a calculation you had done.

~kamera~ - this is the word comes from the word for
           a room, and in Glosa it still
           means room.

~u mi~ - this means mine (belonging to me). As in
               ~U-ci es u mi~ This is mine
               My is just ~mi~, you dont need too 
               mark for single number, but if you did
               you would say ~mi u~.  
               Compare marking for plural 
                   ~Plu-ci es mi plu bibli.~ 
                   These are my books

So I would say 

~Mi doxo; mi pa lose mi foto-grafi-me.~

~Saluta~ - Greetings. If this is the second sentence
            that you have addressed to the man, it 
            seems a strange point to greet him.
~signor~ - Are you calling him this because he is 
           Spanish?
~u-ci~ - this. I guess you mean here ~ci~.
~lose~ - lose not leave.
~place?~ -  seems to make please? the question


I would suggest 

~Senior. Place. Qe mi pa ci linqi id?~

Saluta,
Nick

We have three functions for U(N)/PLU:

1) substitute for the article of our mother languages (whatever it
     then is in Glosa)
2) begin-of-noun-phrase-marker and
3) number-marker (singular/plural).

Ja, "mi u" is Glosa.  And it is bad in my opinion, because it
contradicts 2).  (That was certainly Syd's idea, too.)

Imagine, one wants to write a grammar book (and this should happen
soon!).  He will not be able to express a rule for U(N)/PLU, without
adding a further exception-rule for the order with possessive
pronouns.  With (many) exceptions in its grammar, Glosa cannot compete
with other IALs.

I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.

I am not sure about that.  Perhaps we should ask Wendy.  The meaning
"camera" for "kamera" is in the book "Central Glosa", p. 82.  Of
course it is meant as "camera {room}", but I think "camera {device}"
can be possible, too.  I feel, that the Glosa authors were more in
favour of getting international words -- and "camera {device}" is
international -- than in puristic avoiding of homonyms.

Yes. It would be good to hear what Wendy has to say
about about this.

I think I would be in favour of a few homonyms myself,
but my feeling is that "no homonyms" is one if the
fundamental design features of Glosa.

Saluta,
Nick

The function of the article would be more strictly one of
U-LA or U-CI or PLU-CI or PLU-LA, if I understand the
unmuddled intentions of the authors.

> 2) begin-of-noun-phrase-marker

Several other particles share that function, of course.

> 3) number-marker (singular/plural).

That's the true meaning of U/UN and PLU. As with the verbal
particles, Glosa's noun-phrase particles can be arranged in
a fairly simple paradigm, the relevant items here being:

1. case DE AD etc.
2. number U/UN PLU
3. deictic/definite CI LA

One may question whether items 2 and 3 are ordered properly,
or whether PLU-CI etc should be un-hyphenated, or the deictic
scheme should be separated from definite-ness.

Glosa should be true to its own best nature (analytic grammar and
international vocab), abandoning exceptions and inconsistent features.

> I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.

But they are all fairly easy to fix.

To relinquish control to the next generation.

    The School Master thinks that the Pupil is a new boy, who has lost his
room; thus, the Master will NOT be on the look-out for a missing camera.

    If we are trying to say:-
        "I think I've lost my camera."   
then
       ~Mi puta: mi pa lose mi foto-grafi-me.~

ought to suffice.
  % U mi [mine] is simply a make-up to strengthen the 'nouniness' of ~mi~
which is already a pronoun, anyway.  This shortage of a name for the thing,
which I own, could be covered by invoking "thing."

  Id eqa mi-ra.  =  It is my(thing).

would do the job equally well.  But ~u mi~  =  "the (of) me"   is the
current comstruction .. definitely not needed in front of a tangible like
the, above, missing camera.

Somehow, this ~puta~ has come into the story, and replaced the others. 
  My Latin dictionary says:-
    Puto  1.to prune; 2. a)to estimate, reckon, value, consider;
      b)to think, reflect; c)to believe, suppose.
so, it does seem an adequate word here.

*   But we do not need to changing "thinking" to "believing", unless the
Master questions the Boy's accuracy of reporting, and the Boy finds it
necessary to assert that he really does believe that he did leave his
camera behind.
    The semi-colon does not seem, to me, to be apposite, here.
    Actually, the semi-colon is part of the story of "that" as an
impersonal pronoun, not of the 'logical' "that."

    Id es u-la ~qi~; qi seqe u nomina-verba ke habe u semi-kolon.

    It is that 'that', that follows a noun that has a semi-colon.

    This comes in two forms:-
       An habe epi-se u kapela; qi habe u pina.
       An habe epi-se u kapela; habe u pina.     (elided)

    The 'logical' "that can also be elided:-
       Mi habe nuli problema ko an vesti-auto intra plu komika kapela, sed
mi habe certa ke an kausa an-auto te habe ridi-abili feno, kron an
vesti-auto in mu.
       Mi habe nuli problema ko an vesti-auto intra plu komika kapela, sed
mi habe certa: an kausa an-auto te habe ridi-abili feno, kron an vesti-auto
in mu.                (elided)

    But this 'logical' "that" (~ke~), which seems to relate more to a verb
than a noun, can be replaced by a full colon.

*   The question of 'leaving behind' vs 'losing' is a nice distinction,
and, yes, Nick wins on points.
    Agreed, after looking at the GID, Nick is correct on the title:  senior
   =   Mr
        seniora   =   Mrs
        seniorita =   Miss
        xxxx      =   young Master  ...  probably an archaic form
    It is certainly ~ci~ not ~u-ci~ [this], but the placement is
problematical.  The final word in the sentence does have emphasis, and it
cannot be ~place~ but could be ~ci~.

      ~Place, senior: qe, mi pa linqi ci u foto-grafi-me?~   O.K.
but
      ~Place, senior: qe, mi pa linqi id, ci?~   sounds more natural.

   I would suggest that we base the Glosa Primers on some very creative,
modern language instruction books.  I suspect that the one Syd is using, as
his model, is pre-war.

Saluta,

Robin

*   Thanks Marcel,
    This is quite interesting; it was'nt my work, either.  But, it is
pretty well-written Glosa.  This is quite a mystery: is it written by one
of the Glosalistas flexing his linguistic muscles; or has some rank
outsider demonstrated that Glosa is very easy to pick up and use?
    I will write to one of the contact addresses, possibly the Socialist
Party of Great Britain.

But check the Basic Reference where it says -

Punctuation: 
   Colon precedes items of a list; 
          comma separates list items from each other; 
          it also occurs after a vocative expression. 

   Semicolon separates principal and subordinate 
          clauses; a clause is a group of words
          containing a finite verb.

Examples from 18 Steps 
~Fe stude: biologi, kemi.~
~Mi este sura; tu pa gene mega hedo ex tu visita; e mi
atende plu nova de tu libe-tem.~
~U-ci es u gina; tu pa du dic a.~
~U-ci es u plaka; qi tena kemi-kroma.~

And the rule about ~qi~ given is -
When 'who' or 'which' are the object of a clause they
are usually left out in English. In Glosa we always
leave them out.

So I take it that ~qi~ cannot be omitted if it is the
subject of the clause.

Saluta,
Nick

From: Robin Gaskell <rgaskell{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au>
Date: Fri, 29 Mar 2002 10:59:39 +1100

Mi Plu Karo Amika,

  So, I am going to have to ammend my Website - by adding Seminar #3 to
Seminars #1 & #2.

  The questions have been raised:-
        what does a good Glosa VERB PHRASE look like, and 
        when is Glosa going to get a standardised syntax?

  Seminar #3 is going to address these questions giving answers, 'rules',
and examples.

  But I cannot, nor do I want to, sort out these details in isolation: I
ask for help from the group.
  As I understand it, Ron Clark gave the outline of structure within
phrases, and also of that between phrases, when forming sentences.
  However, people need 'rules' not guidelines; perhaps now is the time to
discover those 'rules.'

  Below, are appended two sections some might have missed .. independently
of one another, Charles and I sent in suggested sequences of word function
within the VERB PHRASE.
  Please look at them, and try them out with examples from Glosa, English,
and any other language you like.
  For example, see if you can say "He quickly very ran," or if some ''more
natural'' sequence forces itself upon you?
  Can we answer the question, 'is syntax ^hard-wired^ into the brain?';
and, if we come down in the affirmative, can we proscribe such a
regularised syntax for Glosa???

  Here are the two suggested schemas:-
==A.=========================================================
>From Charles
> So, the entire scheme would be something like this:
> 
> 1. negative NE, intensive JA
> 2. tenses: NU, PA, FU

> 5. passive GE(?)
> 6. verboids
> 7. adverbs
> 8. the true verb
========================================================

   And basically Glosa has only one, "U".  Not 'a' or 'the'; nor `la` or
`le.`  Agreed, as French has `les`, with the article agreeing with the noun

   The U-LA or U-CI or PLU-CI or PLU-LA quartet are the impersonal pronouns

If you don't really need a "the", sometimes it is handy to have a large
signpost telling people that the phrase, which is commencing, happens to be
a NOUN PHRASE.

    Maybe, in this imperfect world, we can forge a perfect language ...

    As far as I'm concerned, Glosa's phrase sequences are spelled out in
the rules of the Functional Grammar of English.
    The sequence within Noun Phrases is described in Seminar #2 in my
website; and the sequence within Verb Phrases was attempted independently
by Kevin and me during the past month, on Glosalist.

    Blow me down, some years ago I attempted to float a symbol system for
the 'reading' of syntax structure in a sentence - independent of the words.
 Was I ahead of my time, or does a symbol system  demonstrating syntax not
make sense!?

    What about members of this Mailing List dishing up some Glosa sentences
they just cannot force into a regularised syntax!!??
    We'll all do our best to bend them straight.

>> I fear, there will be several of those things in Glosa's grammar.
>
>But they are all fairly easy to fix.
*
   Ron Clark hated the idea of forcing yet another Grammar Book onto the
world.  He said that Prescriptive Grammars were against nature.
   And he had the impression that he was creating a 'natural', Planned
Language: a language that had a logic of its own .. built in.

   So, were he able to see how things would bog down, here on Glosalist,
might he not have tried just a little harder to indicate the  rules
inherent in this natural system?

>> Perhaps we should ask Wendy.
>
>To relinquish control to the next generation.

*  Bit of a nasty one.
   However, I concede that Wendy:
      does not discus developments, within Glosa, through this List;
      may not have studied a lot of Linguistics;
      seems somewhat resistent to change; and
      has not told people of her plans for the future of Glosa.

   But, she:
      is the one recognised, remaining authoritative voice on Glosa;
      wants to see Glosa disseminated via the Net, but is possibly unsure
as to how this might best be achieved; 
      holds charity registration of the Glosa Education Organisation;
      has the longest time-involvement of anyone working with Glosa;
      holds the database of non-Net supporters of Glosa; and 
      can be educated ... on linguistics, educational methods, and business
techniques.

   So, taking all of these factors into account, I wish to work through
Wendy, and under her aegis, however, at the same time, 'upgrading' her
Linguistic status and knowlege of the wider world of Planned Language
Research .. to help her reach the pinnicle of Auxiliary Language
performance, so that she might be the prime spokes-person for Glosa, when
the world eventually asks for our Exemplar.

   Wishful thinking ... maybe.

   However, Wendy has already been to Brussels to represent Glosa, has met
Glosa representatives, from Africa, in Verona, and has presented Glosa at
various book fairs and educational conferences in Europe, so she is the
recognisable and acknowleged 'front person' for Glosa.
   There are just a few difficulties with the Glosalist appearing to go off
at a tangent from the basic language.  One example is "ke", another is the
production of new dictionaries.  Even still, Wendy would like to see the
vocabulary stabilised and standardised, and I am sure that she would like
to see a rash of new stories and articles published on the Internet - once
the challenges of regularised vocab and syntax are met.

Saluta,

Robin 
  P.S.  At 65, I do not form part of the 'next generation'.   R.G.

Robin hath said:

By "article" is meant a particle to indicate definiteness versus
indefiniteness. Some languages have a definite article, the lack of
which indicates indefiniteness; the reverse strategy is also attested.
If "U/UN" were Glosa's true article (which it is not) it would translate
as English "the" or "a/an", but certainly not both. It is actually just
the mark of singular number for its associated noun, though as a happy
side-effect one also can infer the presence of a noun phrase.

> The U-LA or U-CI or PLU-CI or PLU-LA quartet are the impersonal pronouns

It is well-known that the definite article generally evolves from
"deictics" or "demonstratives" (or whatever term you prefer). Clearly
in Glosa's case the purely "deictic" particles CI and LA are adjoined
to the purely singular/plural particles to compose the demonstratives.
Since I can translate "the" and "a/an" using them, and since the Glosa
documentation *does* refer to them as "articles", I'll continue to
call U-LA and brethren the nearest thing to true articles in G.

Enough given above? It's just a standard linguistic term.

What I said means so much more than that.

Why not just study English instead of Glosa, then? More rewarding.

> Was I ahead of my time, or does a symbol system  demonstrating syntax not
> make sense!?

Parse trees make perfect sense, and have since the 1950's.
The problem with analytic langs (as opposed to the synthetic type)
is their relatively complex syntax, so claiming that "Glosa has
no grammar" is an admission of guilt, it's not a plus at all.
Try to define it, and the inconsistencies are exposed.

>>> Perhaps we should ask Wendy.

>> To relinquish control to the next generation.

> Bit of a nasty one.

Admittedly. But both Jesperson and Wahl foresaw the need to turn "their"
langs over to a committee to continue it after them. In fact they asked
for feedback from the beginning, and accepted many suggested modifications.
(Jesperson was the most famous linguistic scientist of his time; he invented
the IPA, and was head of Ido for many years prior to his move to Novial,
BTW.) The great ones can tolerate criticism, and change.

I disagree. In order to be able to quickly read Glosa text,
I need to know when I am shifting from NP to VP and back.

Some languages use suffixes, so by looking at a single word
you know what kind of phrase it belongs to. Glosa doesn't
do that.

Some languages use specific words in specific ways. This
word is _always_ a verb. That word is _always_ an
adjective. Glosa doesn't do that.

Thus, when you have a string of words, like ~pote auxi
dona~, you have no idea whether they are NP, VP, or some
combination. The ONLY ways to figure it out are 1) guess,
or 2) have marker words like ~nu~ and ~plu~.

Perhaps I'm being overly simplistic, but can we get along
with just two rules for verb phrases?

1. Start a verb phrase with pa/nu/fu.
2. Each word must modify the rest of the verb phrase.

Why would ja/ne have to go before pa/nu/fu? Seems like a
needless exception.

Do we really have to restrict the sequence of these? Is
there really anything wrong with something like:

...nu du ne sio ha...

> > 7. adverbs
> > 8. the true verb

These are covered by my second rule, above. This second
rule also prevents something like "quickly very run",
because "very" modifies "quickly run", not just "run".

Basically it's just: particles and modifiers first, full words last.
That's a good place to start, but there are linguistic tendencies
gravitating toward a more detailed paradigm. Like:

> Why would ja/ne have to go before pa/nu/fu? Seems like a
> needless exception.

English goes with the "did/does/will not" order, so maybe Glosa
wants the same. But we also like to put "not" immediately prior
to the thing negated. Often there are competing forces within
a language (and Optimality Theory addresses this) ... I can't
predict what order Glosa would converge to, so I just guessed.
One problem with your first rule is that oriental language
speakers will specify aspect but not tense.

>> 3. modals: SIO, ...
>> 4. aspects: DU, HA(?)
>> 5. passive GE(?)
>> 6. verboids

> Do we really have to restrict the sequence of these? Is
> there really anything wrong with something like:
>
> ...nu du ne sio ha...

That gets difficult to parse without some combinatorial restrictions.
I think something sensible would evolve in practice if there were
a true speech community using G. In your example, HA and DU are
opposite aspects that would never co-occur. But I can imagine
"he shouldn't be driving" rendered with "... nu ne sio du ...",
fitting Bickerton's Tense-Mode-Aspect creole auxiliary order.

>> 7. adverbs
>> 8. the true verb

> These are covered by my second rule, above. This second

> because "very" modifies "quickly run", not just "run".

I worry about (both kinds of) adverbs though:
They can certain(ly) very fast get very mess(y).
Also can't figure out passives and a few others.

But when it's all finished evolving, I think a paradigm is the
easiest way to show the whole grammar thing, even to beginners.
There would be one for verb phrases, another for noun phrases.
(I use pull-down boxes on a web page to generate sample phrases.)

1) ~ne~   (or even ~ja~)
2) ~nu~, ~pa~, ~fu~, ~nu pa~, 
                ~nu fu~, ~fu pa~, ~pa fu~
3) ~sio~

       etc
10) ~ci~, ~intra~, ~ana~, ~qestio~, ~fobo~, etc
11)  repeat of 7)

With none of the elements being mandatory.

Guessing is good! It's what we do with the many ambiguous
sentences that can occur in English. Mostly, we don't even
notice we  are doing it!

I don't think it is wrong to include as many markers as you
like. I am just against a rule to make it compulsory, as that
just makes Glosa hard to get right, because it is not "natural".
If it were "natural" then, we wouldn't need a rule.

One can say that syntax is hard-wired in the brain, in the sense that
every language has a syntax. But not every language has the same
syntax. What is hard-wired is that there are certain possible patterns,
and certain impossible patterns. For language X the pattern is A,
and for language Y the pattern is the not A. And the pattern we learn
as children, seems to us to be the "natural" pattern.

Interglossa had a very rigidly defined syntax, which was clear but made 
it seem cold and clinical and rather boring. Glosa went to the other 
extreme and was very flexible. All sorts of possibilities were tried out,
and some were kept, some were thrown out, and some revisions
were made over the years of development.

What one needs to do, is to look at real sentences as they are now, 
and to draw out the rules that underlie the constructions, rather than 
invent a logical framework and try to force Glosa into it.

Nick

   Pushing the 'rule' backwards from the plural ~ ... mi plu bibli,~  we
could get a construction, ~ ... mi u bibli.~  But there is no possible
reason for using the ''singular'' marker, ~U~, if we already have the
situation covered with the "singular" ~MI.~
   ~U mi ...~ is a gross tautology; ~U-mi ...~, on the other hand, is an
acceptable special form.

  Can Glosa accomodate such 'human' needs, without compromising its
syntactical nicities: I sincerely hope so.  In fact, if we ever do find the
brain's inner laws of syntax, I believe that such variable placement - for
emphasis - will be part of the story.

*  Agreed about the need for a Grammar Book: I did tabulate my
understandings  of Glosa's grammar - by observation of the language in
action - a year, or so ago.
   However we ought to be clear as to whether we want to write a
prescriptive grammar or a more post-scriptive one.  If we lay down the laws
of syntax as a prescription, then we will be suggesting that people MUST
follow such laws, unthinkingly, even thogh the resulting sentences might
FEEL wrong.
   For this reason, I have implored people to actually use Glosa to write
stories, treatises and poems, or even boring prose, simply to let the
"words do the talking."  Try to express things in Glosa according to what
appear to be the 'rules' of syntax; then, when sentences don't seem to work
out right, recast them, and try to find a more human form of expression,
while maintaining, or expanding, a rule-based schema.
   I am probably trying to say that Linguists should not compile grammars:
the people should.  Once enough has been said, naturally, by the people,
then Linguists can be called in to deduce the 'rules.'  At the moment,
Glosa might be seen to be a Linguist top-heavy, and communicator
under-weight language.

   We have strange word categories, like ~KE~, which Ron gathered
originally from Esperanto.  And we have strange grammatical constructions,
like the PASSIVE VOICE which suits a lot of people's brain-waves, and ought
to be given room in Glosa.  Also, we are just discovering the possessive
pronouns: these are popular enough to be part of Glosa, too.
   And, all that's before even thinking of the "feel" of language, or the
"Universal Grammar of Syntax."

*  Not a problem, if all can be explained.  And I feel it can: the 'small
box' in a house, and the 'small box' with a lens, can be seen as synonyms,
but I think they shouldn't; I believe that we have a 'metaphor' situation,
here.
   This comes down to a question of which came first: have there been "rooms"
for thousands of years, or have there been "cameras" for at least two
hundred years?  If a photographic camera is like a small room with a curved
sperical glass where the window ought to be, then the photographic device
can easily be seen as a metaphor.  In Glosa, as with synonyms, we are
trying to keep metaphorical usages to a minimum, but sometimes the metaphor
is a lot easier than the 'descriptive' Glosa term.  And, if everyone knows
the metaphorical use, then why would we try to pressurise people to adopt a
super-special Glosa word, instead.  I feel we should avoid the tendency to
become a Glosa version of the Academie Francaise, which has to find a
special French-language version for everything.

    Did you get your camera back, Sid?

    As with Glosa, Spanish or any language, the thing to aim at is not the
individual words, but to try to get the 'lilt' of the language, and to try
to THINK IN THE LANGUAGE.
    What does it feel like to put words together in the particular way of
the natives?!  Spanish, or whever see a logic in the way they speak (not
write), and it is this logic that we need to go for in our learning of a
particular language.
    My highly intelligent Chinese mate, while living in my spare bedroom,
used to listen to talk-back radio, and mimicked the different voices and
their vocal inflections - as their contributions came across the radio.  In
China, he had learnt American English; by the time he had spent a month of
his spare time repeating talk-back radio, he was speaking Australian English.
    This should work with Spanish radio; and, when we get it up and
running, Glosa radio.

Go with the Flow, I always say,

    I am collecting all of these ideas into a "Seminar #3" subdirectory.

    Have you or any others been thinking about the story that goes with
such schema, to give anyone an idea about how they can make it all work.
    My thought is to start with a simple three-part sentence - subject,
verb, object - and to build up the Verb Phrase progressively, so that one
by one the bits fall into place as the VP grows in complexity.

    Oh yes, I must add that I do like to push the ideas about in real,
imaginable situations, so that the idea of a sterile Glosa text is lost.
IE with EGs.

*  This looks like a good list, Nick.
   I am please to see we agree on the absence of P-o-S markers.  I know
that this was the clear intention of the Glosa authors.

   - I am going back through old downloads to see what I missed -

   Many items on your list are still hazy, and not set in concrete, but
they could be worked on .. though not endlessly.

   When I last sought authoritative work on the subtle level of universal
syntax rules I did not get far - I might try again.  Then, this could be a
first for Glosa: maybe these syntax universals have not been tackled by the
Linguists, yet.

   Punctuation is reasonably thought out in Glosa, with some dislike of the
semi-colon - on beauty points, I fear.  But, in Glosa, which does rely on
word order and structure within sentences, I believe that punctuation is
much more important than it is, say, in English.  For this reason, I
believe that the writer should use suitable punctuation to indicate the
start of phrases and clauses - where an absence of punctuation could cause
ambiguity.  In English, the current fashion is against using commas
'sculpturally', but I think we cannot afford such whimsy in a language with
syntax-based grammar.

   More work needed, with example needed to demonstrate compounding.  Use
or non-use of the hyphen should be clear-cut.  Possibly a special sort of
grouping mark could be used to show that a set of unhyphenated substantives
comprised a compound.
  EG  He turned on the _wind monitoring hurricane detector_ just in time to
predict that the next tornado was only two hours away.

   THe rule of thumb on phrase markers is that a comma indicates the start
of a new phrase - but this is only essential in complicated sentences, and
the comma can be elided in simple sentences.  The other idea is that the
next stage up, the semi-colon, acts as a guidepost to the start of a
clause.  This is a reasonable rule, but, where an excess of semi-colons
might seem a little heavy-handed, commas will often handle the start of a
new clause.  If a standard rule can be derived, then it would be a good
idea, but we must always leve people the option of eliding non-essential
punctuation.

   It goes without saying that I cannot start pulling your leg in polite
society, if some present do not know that I am using an English idiom.
However, it is a bit high-handed of us to rule idioms out completely,
especially if they are the point of a joke, or necessary to give colour to
a story.  As long as there is a way of indicating the presence of
non-literal language, then people will attempt to read an idiom in context,
or will know to reach for their dictionary of idiomatic phrases.
  EG.  Joe pa dice ke an pa du es ^trakto mu plu poda^ tem u pa horo, e u
holo history pa es ge-face ex an.

   This clear definition of words has taken up far too much time, already,
and should be finalised before the middle of this year.  Wow, did I say
that!?  Looks like those of us active in this are will have to really
complete the job.

Saluta,

Robin

   No markers or sign-posts of any kind, but the old S-V-O rule takes the
day.  Do we need to talk of "zero-marking" here?

   At a pinch I could say the were 'particles' that often acted as 'phrase
markers'.

   However the need to see sentences as collections of phrass, rather than
collections of words is quite true.  Contrary to popularly held belief, the
phrase, not the word, is the unit of meaning in a sentence.
   This idea was tested in the real world through creation of the
sentence-building game _KrostVerb_ (or "Skribble").  Unlike crosswords and
"Scrabble", which criss-cross single letters, my game jumped to the third
level of organisation, and criss-crossed phrases.  The game, which was
designed to be a Glosa teaching tool in Uganda, never quite made it to
Africa, but the English-language version worked very well.  More on
KrostVerb if anyone is interested.

Where-do-I-put-that-word, there is a whole world of Semantics out there,
waiting for Glosa to discover it.  While Ron Clark concentrated on the
visible Syntax element of grammar, I suspect that he put the element of
Semantics on the ^back burner^ for a ^rainy day^.

   Es [to be] is just one of a number of concepts that are encapsulated
into words, and conveniently categorised with other words that seem to
function in the same way.  But we fall into difficulty if we are to treat
all 'doing and being' words in the same way.  The actual concept behind a
word will often rule just how we use it. 
   Yet I agree with Ron Clark's principle: ''the listener comes halfway
towards the speaker'' when making sense of what is said.
   In fact the listener, or reader, brings much to the commuincation
process, otherwise no transmission of information could take place.  So,
this all leads to the idea that we do not have to, no should we, define the
language's usage very precisely to its learners.

   My finding is that I do not simply transfer my normal English sentence
structure into Glosa, although some uncritical types have claimed it to be
so.  In fact, well-written Glosa does 'map' almost word for word onto
acceptable English sentences, BUT well-written English does not always map
onto properly formed Glosa sentences.
   Thus, I find that Glosa syntax is a sub-set of English syntax, and, as
such, IS more rigorous than that of English ... and, accordingly, more simple.

I think that ~mi u bibli~ is the underlying form.

Compare - ~epi u tabla~ = ~epi tabla~.
and ~mi mo bibli~ [my one book].

That ~mi~ is "singular", doesn't seem to be relevant.
As ~na~ is "plural", what does ~na bibli~ mean?

It is an interesting question as to whether ~bibli~ is
"singular" by default. If so, then why do we ever
need to use ~u~? Or if like "tense", once we have
established the "number" of a noun, we can leave
it unmarked.

What did he give to my aid? (Confusion of MI as a possessive.)
Also, it would be heard as "An dona mi auxi" if spoken. And
then I'd have to ask, who did he give my help to? Because
*semantically* the verb "give" connects up-to-3 noun phrases.

There is a very clear preposition to mark the verb-to-object transition.
And again, the pronoun AN could be a possessive and the DON(A) could
be an adjective: "His given/giving help to me". What you'd really say
in good clear Glosa would be "An pa auxi mi."

You rely too heavily on semantics to resolve all the syntactic
ambiguities resulting from over-agressive elision of particles.
Whenever an auxlanger appeals to semantics to resolve ambiguity,
I recognize an emperor lacking clothes. Have some mercy for the
innocent readers, and use the d{at}mned particles.

I didn't understand GE, asked for clarification, got the answer it is
the same as in English. In English it is used both for some sort of
past tense/aspect and as a participle. Thus it can be called ambiguous.
And it's much the same with DU: is it used as the "other" participle?

I have never studied German and so have no intuition about GE,
but I'm quite sure it is *not* etymologically "get" or "gain".
AFAICT, Glosa DU = English "-ing" and Glosa GE = English "-ed".

One problem with fusing the participles and aspects is that you now
*must* specify tense to indicate where a verb phrase begins. Asians
will not like that (being used to specifying aspect without tense).

At any rate, there are no languages lacking some means of expressing
both aspect and tense. Glosa uses FU NU PA for tense, and apparently
GE and DU for both aspect *and* participles. I withdraw my previous
suggestion of HA for the perfective aspect, already performed by GE.
(I like the idea of having a present/active participle, at least ...)

What rules? Glosa still has no grammar.

Now please explain the passive voice of Glosa, since I can't figure
that out either. I hope you won't say it's just the same overloading
of "ES = to be" as in English. I had thought GE was involved somehow.

He help my writings some sentences. Close enough.

Perhaps. Yes, I can figure out the meanings of all of these
simple sentences. But in every case it was the SECOND path
I tried that yielded the correct result. If I am trying to
read quickly, or parse spoken text in real time, that's a
problem.

~Un andra~ means "a man", whereas ~An~ would me "he". I am
willing to omit the leading NP marker, because most
sentences start with a NP. The only problems I have with
this are sentences like ~pluvi~ ("it is raining"), and
~veni!~ (command). I would like to see an imperative twin
of ~qe~ to clear up the latter. The former seems to be rare
enough and involve such simple sentences that it doesn't
seem to be a problem.

The ~nu~ is VERY helpful in the sentence above, as shown by
my earlier parsing attempts.

I don't like or use the ~te~, so I agree it doesn't help
here.

I am willing to come half way (or more) towards a speaker
to understand the meaning. I have a hard time coming more
than half way just to parse the sentence.
