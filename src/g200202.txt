If Glosa is ever ''given to the world,'' 50% of learners will be adults
attempting to cram it in - without much digestion - and 50% will be
schoolchildren, grateful for all the shoe-horning they can get.
    The less than 1%, comprising Professors of Linguistics, language
enthusiast, and a small literati, will want the pure language all in one
hit.  However...
    I was thinking that people for whom the European alphabet is a strange
foreign invention, much like Chinese writing is to us, will be grateful of
a limited, simple and 'easy to recognise' vocabulary.  I know that many
English-speakers, who are linguistically illiterate, will be very thankful
of being able to pick up Glosa in morcel-sized chunks.

  Ron Clark did try that, if you take the 'Glosa 6000' dictionary as the
"regular" lexicon.
  For me a 'trainer-wheels' vocab is the mythical Learner's Dictionary of
approx. 2500 words.  The Glosa 1000 list is a 'bastard' list made up to fit
inside an air-mail letter.

   And this gets to my 'PRAGMATIC question of cost,' which point you failed
to comment on: somebody, or something, has to cover the  P&P costs of
distributing the raw materials of a language.
   The bigger your teaching lexicon the bigger are your printing and
postage costs.  I know that Paul Bartlett dislikes my mentioning this very
pragmatic, and unscholarly criterion for vocabulary size, but it has been a
significant factor in the size of functional vocabulary of Glosa-pe.  I
understand that Sid Pidd's restrictionof his Glosa use to the '1000' list
is that he expects that all functional Glosa-ists will know what he is
speaking about.

   How many Glosalist subscribers have equipped themselves with "Glosa
6000"?  This is not a matter of criticism of those who have not: it is a
comment on the rather high costs of purchasing one, and having it sent to
you.  At the beginning of a project like this one, pragmatics do play a
significant part.
   As very soon as an agreed lexicon can be compiled - with, or without,
Wendy's approval; but, preferably WITH the authorisation of Glosa Central,
I will find a way of laser printing it, doublesided, using the least number
of pages.  If I am to act as a seminal point for the Glosa lexicon .. from
the continent most distant from anywhere else .. P&P will be a serious
consideration for me, because I am liable to give away numbers of copies of
both a Learner's 2500 Word Dictionary and the full lexicon.  So, having
observer the non-commercial nature of anything other than the well-known
Esperanto, I figure that to restart the Glosa process, I will have to give
away scads of wordlists, which are likely to be printed on air-mail paper.
The cost of laser printing and sea-mail will be significant to me, despite
what Paul Bartlett says.

   All that is stopping me is the compilation of the full lexicon and the
selection from it of a shorter starter vocab, and a longer literary vocab,
of approx. 2500 and 6000 words.
   For financial reasons I cannot retire yet, but in a year's time, when I
am 'not in paid employment,' I will tackle the task - if resolution has not
been achieved before then.

>Even in English, I prefer to use words that people are
>likely to recognize and understand at a glance, rather than

>
*  This does not compute!
   Some of the Greek and Latin roots, in the full lexicon and the Literary
Dictionary, will seem "obscuire" and some will frefer them, just to
'impress' others.  However, I think that the words for a Learner's
Dictionary will be decided, by concensus, on Glosalist, to be those most
likely to be "recognised" by speakers of English and the European languages.
   The word "variety" rates as an antonym of "repetition"; and, the reason
that some writers, choosing to exercise good literary style, will use Greek
and Latin synonyms within Glosa, is that they feel uncomfortable with
repetitious writing.  I'd be prepared to bet that such an element of good
style is found in all cultures that have a written language.

  Yes I think the exercise was worthwhile: it helps set standards for

  As a P.S., the lexical items, and their spelling, I used are all found in
Glosa 6000.

*  O.K. that's it: I'm going to have to gather up all of the word-lists in
existence, and compile them into a 'Draft Total Lexicon' comprising all
words and all variants of spelling.
   Reckon I'll have to split the work into twenty three segments - one per
letter of Glosa's alphabet.  Be ready to help with the concensus on
spelling when the "A"s hit your screen.  My guess is that all obscure words
can be left in the Total Lexicon; but we will still need to iron out the
wrinkles of words with different spellings.

   How I fit all this in .. between saving the World, and getting ready for
retirement .. I do not know, but it's got to be done.  
   Oh, Yes, though it is off topic, I would mention another distraction: I
have registered with Sony to play the game, "Everquest."  However, I can
only do so at present on my daughter's system, and this only when she is
not connected; it's a Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing game
(MMORP), and a very addictive one.  Presently, my Barbarian Shaman,
'Kirsk,' is at Level 4, hunting in the snows outside Hallas on the mythical
island of Antonica within the world of Norrath.
   Considering that I can be another five characters as well, I am looking
forward to getting my purpose-built, superior game-playing computer, so
that I can get on with the quests.  After I have the Everquest machine made
up, there will be even more tension in my time budget than there is at
present.  So, I might cut back my Glosalist involvement proportionally; it
could get to the stage where, in my virtual/reality world, the most
intriguing 'quest' gets first priority.

   Meanwhile, back at Glosa, once we agree to the Total Lexicon, which
results from editing of the Draft Total Lexicon's spelling, we can get on
with "emboldening" the most commonly used thousand words, compiling a
Starter Dictionary file (of approx. 2500 words), and preparing a Literary
Dictionary (equivalent to the present Glosa 6000).
   At what stage is Wendy Ashby brought into the process?  Agreed she
should be in it now, but since she is not connected, this involves the
sending of pidgeon-post letters halfway around the world and back - without
the benefits of the virtual immediacy of reply from the Net.

   And there's another question: who among us thinks about the
dissemination of Glosa ideas plus printed Glosa wordlists and dictionaries
to those outside the Internet?  How many others on Glosalist consider there
is relevance in our compiling least-cost-postage, printed dictionaries, for
distribution beyond the Net?

*   These all use the  com-put-er  conceptualisation:

        ~=  altogether - thinkORcalculate - er(person/thing/doer)

    In 500 years will ~puta-me~  =  thinking - machine   not be a briefer
and better derived term?

    This is an ideological conundrum: should recognisability over-ride
the rules of derivation (which are concept/logic based); or ought the
suitable Glosa term represent the fundamental ideas comprised by a
concept?

    Still, if I say, "Yesterday, he finally computed it," how does this
look in Glosa?

     Pa-di, an pa fini compu id.    Pa-di, an pa fini computi id.   

  But whatever happened to the "C"/"K" discrimination?

  

     Pa-di, an pa fini kompu id.    Pa-di, an pa fini komputi id.   ???


  Then there is the question of derivative terms:-

 computer printer   -   puta-me tipo-me,  kompu-tipo-me, 
komputi-tipo-me

 while computing   -   tem uti u puta-me,  tem kompu,  tem komputi

 a computer printer ribbon  -  u puta-me tipo-me riboni [RIBONI??
banda?]

                               u kompu-tipo-me riboni

 a laser printer cartridge  -  u laser tipo-me inklude-ra  

 a computer-typed book  -  u puta-me ge-tipo bibli, 

                           u kompu ge-tipo bibli

                           u komputi ge-tipo bibli


 a book on computer type-faces  - u bibli de plu tipo-stilo pro 
puta-me,

                                  u kompu, tipo-stilo bibli

                                  u komputi-tipo-stilo bibli

                                  u puta-me-tipo-stilo bibli

   Firstly, I give possible roots the 'tongue test' by finding how the
phrase feels and sounds, when I say it.  Does the prospective root _feel_
right when I try it in its various functional roles!?

   In the case of <<computing> it could be more comfortable to have two
roots here: <bold>puta-me</bold> and komputi.  While these would
represent Glosa-generated synonyms - one Classically based, and the other
derived from National language usage - it would keep the fusty old
fundamentalists, like me, happy, while allowing Charles and others to use
recognisable vocab.


   While on compounding, is ~-tipo-stilo~  'printing style' or
'type-styles'?  Once the computer appendix to Glosa is decided upon ..
and published .. then a set of derived terms, with their implied
derivation algorithms plain to see, will be ^set in concrete^ and will
allow people to see the compounds as "prescribed", and not as an ad hok
set of inspirationally derived terms.  

   The user of a language wants to look up a word, memorise it, and use
it the same way every time.

   However, he wants to feel confident, also, when he meets a newly-added
compound including a root he knows, that - according to the derivational
rules (algorithm), which he has picked up subconsciously - he interprets
this new usage correctly.

   Thus, I believe that the derivational algorithms work at two levels:
firstly, within the research community that derives them, and applies
them to lexicon formation; and secondly, intuitively, subconsciously by
the learners of the language.

   While such algorithms should be unobtrusive, leaving the user with the
feeling that they are speaking a recognisable, pleasant-sounding, and
well-formed language, they also must satisfy the criteria of those
actively using them to produce new lexical items.  Do the newly-formed
compounds look and sound pleasant?  Are they awkward to fit the mind and
tongue around?

   If we are to put every root and all of its possible compounds ^under
the microscope^, then Glosa will wait another decade, or so, before
Fairy-Tale writers will think of putting pen to paper in the cause of
translating/telling/rewriting, into Glosa, the stories of their
childhood.

   

   It is my observation that the logic of algorithm-formation is not
always the way the mind works: otherwise the search for 'language
universals' would not be an on-going persuit.  While a PERL algorithm can
be given to those transcribing Special Interest Appendices into Glosa, I
believe that a set of instructions is needed, also.  Otherwise, such
programmed transcribers are likely to come up with sectional Glosa
lexicons that contains significant amounts of words that seem un-natural,
and do not fit well within the human mind, mouth or ear.

    Personally, I am happy to say that modifiers come before the
substantives ('adjectives' and 'adverbs' come before the 'nouns' and
'verbs'), and leave it for the writer/speaker to sort it out.

    I know that, in English, we appear to use adverbs to modify
adjectives, but saying it this way could simply be a Linguists'
confusion.

language that all can learn easily, and of concentrating on a
'technology-based' language that is purpose-built for wide-ranging
participation in solution of the Planet's very evident environmental and
organisational problems.

    Originally, I thought Glosa was going to be a 'tourist usable'
science-based language; I still do not know if this is a possibility, but
I hope it is.

  BUT the Latin dictionary gives  <italic>fames, famis.

that FAMINA beats FAMIN.

    Sadly, I do not feel the need for a retrospective specification of
Glosa's vocabulary, simply a prospective one for neologisms.  And then, I
would imagine a 'reviewing committee' looking at the items of a Special
Interest Appendix, and making suggestions of alternative words, where the
proposed terminology seemed at variance from the theme of the language.

    The only positive factor, on the economic side, is the establishment

*   Well, I cannot see there being anything other than choices being
made: alphabet, pronunciation, style of grammar .. and then you seek out
a suitable vocabulary base.  Indo-European comes to mind.

    At least the Euro script is ubiquitous on computer keyboards, it has
a reasonably general usage across much of the world; and, through
historical fact, the Euros control most of the World's wealth.

    And now, with America declaring its status as the World's remaining
super-power, do we have any choice than to acquire a Euro-based
lingua-munda?

The capital letter in the beginning is enough: Sterling.

I feel "ton" as an international word, not special English, though
perhaps even here a capital letter would be better and enough then:
Ton.

Again and again Robin emphasizes, how much he likes "Glosa 6000" and
that he will make it to the starting point of his new dictionary.
Repeatedly I say, that I do not agree.  I wrote my opinion about
"Glosa 6000" in http://www.glosa.org/en/bibli.htm .

Some of these are actually the ones who might want a bigger
language in my mind.

Anyway, I think you just agreed with me that a language
with fewer words would meet the desires of nearly 100% of
the target population. (Actually, I would put the number at
more like 60-80%).

For the last several months, I have restricted my Glosa
vocabulary to the words in my unofficial core list (ever
since I created that list). I only rarely have trouble
coming up with the right word to express my thoughts. Even
then, with enough creative thought, I have not yet had to
exceed my 1200 root inventory.

>    How many Glosalist subscribers have equipped

I have one, in electronic form. I need it to read Glosa
that other people have written. I find it cumbersome when
writing my own Glosa material, because there are too many
synonyms to choose from. And I prefer to write in a way
that people can read without having to refer to a word
list.

> shorter starter vocab, and a longer literary vocab,

I can live with those names for the lists. "Starter" is
nicer than "Training wheels", and the fact that neither is
claimed to be the "regular" list helps.

I think this partly depends on _why_ you are writing. If I
am writing specifically to communicate an idea to someone,
I would prefer to do so in the most direct way possible.
Repetition is fine in that setting. In fact, it is a _good
thing_, because at worst the reader only has to look up one
word, instead of three words that hold the same meaning.

If you are writing poetry or literary fiction, or perhaps
if you are giving a speech, I can understand why repetition
might hurt the "flavor" of what you are trying to say. 

But what is the primary purpose of an IAL? In my mind, it
is to efficiently deliver ideas. Eventually, later, when it
is already serving that purpose and people wish to expand
it to other uses, and enough people are already comfortable
with the core words, then the extra words will be helpful
to some people.

Kevin

I still think that's the long way around. I (and everyone
else) will have a much harder time participating, because I
will have to look up and understand something like 10,000
words, just to make informed decisions about words that I
know I will never end up using in practice.

Why would it be so bad to start with 2500 words, and then
grow the list as a second step?

I think that those of us with access to instant
communications should bear the brunt of smoothing out the
language. Once the language becomes reasonably stable,
printed material makes a lot of sense.

I am all in favor of fewer words, so as a side effect I am
in favor of lower printing and mailing costs.

I'll propose one possible set of rules:

Capitals are used to start a sentence.

Also, use capitals whenever there is a name that is not
necessarily a valid Glosa word. This indicates that there's
no point in looking the word up, because you [probably]
won't find it. The word might actually happen to _be_ a
Glosa word, but the meaning is not relevant to
understanding the sentence.

Thus, I would say:

Mi feli nomina es Figaro.
Mi kani nomina es Mega.
Mi mega kani pa kursi.
Mi e Mega pa kursi.
Mi nu eko in nord California.
Mi nu habe u Mazda vagona.
Mi nu amo u Glosa lingua.
Mi pa glosa u timbra.

Does that make sense?

Kevin

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Sat, 2 Feb 2002 15:04:11 EST

I have a vague feeling that Glosa is more or less a variety of English. That 
is not an adverse criticism and not surprising in that its main developers 
were English speaking - what I tend to do is to write or think in English, 
replace the usual words with posher ones, shorten them and then hey presto, I 
have some quite presentable Glosa. When I follow Robin's advice and think in 
Glosa, I get my knuckles rapped!
    How to think in Glosa ...
A G sentence can be divided into groups of words (pretty obvious but never 
mind).
Each group has a main concept with other concepts reinforcing its meaning, 
some groups also have the concept of relative time others have the concept of 
more or less absolute number.
The time groups relate the whole sentence to the time of writing/speaking or 
to another expression of time that is itself related to writing time.
It helps the reader/listener to be informed at the beginning of the group 
that it is a time group by starting with a word that refers to the time - pa, 
fu, nu, du, (ha), pa-di, Decembre, ko tako etc. sometimes ("es") it is not 
necessary. If you leave these references out, the reader may become unsure 
and puzzled.
The number group would start with u, plu, 765, multi, oligo  and so on.
We now have time groups (VP), number groups (NP) we can put them in Glosa 
order SVO Io
 I have a vague feeling that Glosa is more or less a variety of English
VP - have - present tense - nu-du habe - however the S is "I" which is a 
complete NP, we know easily where it ends and the VP starts so "habe" is 
sufficient
O1 - concept "feel" - number 1 - supporting concept "vague". Number + support 
+head = "u no-klari senti"
O2  - the next group could be "a feeling = G is more....."
so I shall use "iso" ( this avoids the disagreement over ";" and "ke", and is 
probably abetter way) 
We have another sentence - VP ="es" - OK as is -  "Glosa" is unique therefore 
number =1 and is implicit - S= "Glosa" (a logical use for a capital)
O - head =variety, number =u - "more or less" is an idiom, "nearly" might be 
better  
and helps "variety" as does " of English"

I found some phrases which have different places for adverbs in
different langs.
I know English well. (not about me)
Ya khorosho znayu angliyskiy.
(Tr. ya= I, khorosho=well, znayu=know)
Mi bone scias la anglan.

In Glosa:
Boni, mi ski un England-lingua.
Mi boni ski un England-lingua.
????

The Sun shines brightly.
Solntse svetit yarko. or Solntse yarko svetit.
(Tr. solntse=Sun, svetit=shines, yarko=brightly.)

In Glosa:
????

There will be more!

Alex.

    . This is one reason I see the pruning of letters from the Glosa
alphabet as not making sense.
    . When new words are added to a pre-selected short lexicon, we are
likely to find that a new concept logically is symbolised by a certain
spelling BUT this spelling, or something very close, has been selected
already for another word, for which that spelling is not as appropriate.
So, then we might start playing ^musical chairs^ with the spellings, to
jostle the existing lexicon to fit in the new words.
     . Without going out looking for new concepts not already covered
within the present Glosa word lists, it is, I believe, a very good idea to
make sure that all the words we've got, already, fit together neatly,
without unwanted duplications, with standardised spellings, and with a view
to leaving sufficient space between the words, to allow for
as-yet-undiscovered concept-words to be added to the lexicon later.
     . As well as breadth of alphabet, there is also the idea of depth of
wordlength.  So, with more letters, and the allowance for mainly short
words, but with some longer ones, we will have sufficient space for a
comprehensive lexicon.
     . The only word that comes to mind is "overview."  I would like to get
the overview of Glosa right first, before I start establishing subsets of
the lexicon at 2500 and 6500 words.
     . However, if I'm the only one taking this 'holistic' view to
vocabulary-building, then I will work with others, happily, on the
'additive' approach.  However, I am starting to get the feeling that I am
running short of time, and do not believe that we have the luxury of
working at the 'basic research' level endlessly, but should be working to
some sort of 'closure.'

Have been looking at the Esperanto Teach Yourself book. 10 brownie points
for the pronunciation instructions - same as IPA - minus a point or two
for having sqiggly bits on c s and z but I came across these in Croatia -
easy enough.

So now I can make a reasonable shot, as I could in Croatia, at the E
pronunciation after about 5 minutes. The next chapters look rather dull
to me - I don't think  I like E very much. Two things there for G to
learn, use IPA and try to make a brighter book so I suggest something
like the following:- start with a G sentence - U Sud Kremna pa es no sura
u kremna. Id pa es no kline sati.

now the vocab - es=is/be/am/are,  id=it,  kline= slope, kremna=cliff, 
no=no/not,  pa= past (pa es=was),  sati-enough,  sud=south,  sura=sure, 
u=a/the

your reader can now make something of the G without too much bother -
also starts an interest in what might happen next.

an analysis of the construction of G (it has no grammar ......) no jargon
etc if poss

starting with the group of words that have time

"pa" in front of a word makes it in the past - was, "pa habe"=had

  before this group is the subject group "u sud kremna"

"u" tells us that this is the beginning of a name-word-group , the main
word is "kremna" and the word "sud" helps the meaning of the the main
word

We now mention the IPA (and how to get a tape! I am working on that) and
explains the use of the capital letters in "U" and "Sud Kremna"

 the next sentence gets a similar treatment and eventually a simple tale
of a boy wearing out the seat of his trousers sliding down short
stretches of slope (guilty!)

unfolds better, I think than a fairy tale which might put off some adult
readers at this stage.

I might try that in Esperanto, Spial ........ at the moment I have a few
reservations about G and,I fancy, G has some about me so that I feel
doubtful about going further in G  just now. See what Wendy thinks about
thre idea

*   Hi friends,

</fontfamily>      From reading Sid's response, I feel he is on the right
track:-

  . Wendy propably has no time to sit down and type out a Glosa
instruction book.

  . If you, Sid, have time to put your ideas into draft format, then the
best advice is to DO IT.

  . At present, the only instructional book we have is "18 Steps ..."; if
each activist on this List presented the group with one draft of an
instructional book, then we might even have five ideas ready for
development - instead if the one we have now.

  . If people are not precious about their productions, then one, or two,
well thought out instructional books can result from the melding of
elements from the drafts from different Glosa-pe.

  .  While browsing an educational bookshop, I saw a 'Dictionary of
Maths' and bought it with the general plan of trying out the idea of a
"Glosa per numera."  My draft would not actually represent a
Glosa-by-numbers, but more the thought of using different aspects of
counting and quantity, as the prop on which to introduce this strange,
new language.  The draft would probably have facing pages in Glosa and
English.

  .  Although the lexicon conundrum, which is taking too long to unravel,
remains unresolved, there is no reason for some of our number not to be
working on the more creative aspect of writing teaching material.


   Hey Sid, please give an example - scanned from the book, or retyped by
you - of the way that Esperanto demonstrates its use of IPA .. in 
print.


   My reservations are not actually against 'pure research', but they
probably are about the doing of basic research into the form of Glosa,
considering that I am - in some conformist way - attempting to help in
realisation of the fundamental linguistic conception of Glosa's authors. 
And, as well as that, I can recall witnessing the many hours of very
concentrated effort that Ron and Wendy put into the formulation of Glosa
as it now stands.  It really is rather amazing that the language reached
the almost complete form it has achieved - before Ron Clark's unexpected
death. 

   While others may differ on the level of completion in Glosa's present
formulation, I believe that it is time to move on .. with what we have
got .. to the "Application" stage of Glosa's R&D process.  The hic-cup of
inconsistent vocabulary and excess synonyms does present the need for a
retrospective look at the existing lexicon - with a view to standardising
it -- not, as I understand the situation, to fundamentally re-organising
it.

<bold>I am very glad you can percieve this problem.

Is the 'root' spread into two significantly different concepts ..
necessitating, or suggesting, the use of two separate Glosa words to
facilitate spoken communication; or do we keep the one 'root' for both,
but add a hyphenated "generic term" to the 'derived' concept, extending
the original, basic concept?

IE.  Are ~famili~, as a fundamental substantive word, and ~familiari~, as
the derived modifier, sufficiently semantically distant to warrant the
existence of two words in the Glosa lexicon?

IE`. Are the fundamental concepts of 'hunger' and 'famine' so different
as to warrant the existence of two Glosa words?  Alternatively, can a
'generic term' be added, or should a descriptive usage be invented to
cover the more abstract concept of a 'general hunger'?   ~famina~
[hunger], ~famina-ra~ [hunger thing],

~u generali famina~ [general hunger]  ???

*** In the case of ~famili~ and ~familiari~ I prefer the two words;
alternatively, with ~famina~, I would opt to stick with the one
substantive.

N.B. I used human intuition to assist in making this decision: my
conclusion might not sit well with the Chinese or Arabs; other ethnic
groups might have very different cultural associations within the
concepts of 'family/familiarity' and 'hunger/famine', however, I have
tried to use ''culture-free'' thinking in reaching my conclusion.

<bold>Agreed CVCV is mainly for the "Function Words", like ~pote~,
~posi~, ~nece~, etc, but also for the rather common substantives, like
~bibe~, ~fago~, ~domi~, ~aero~, etc: there is nothing wrong with that.=20
However, at no stage did the Glosa authors proscribe words of four
letters with CVCV structure.  They did, however, select roots for their
brevity and ease of pronunciation, and this often resulted in four-letter
dictionary entries.  Also, they deduced that many languages had
'sing-song' qualities, which resulted from the alternation of vowels and
consonants; and so, they sought words that had the alteration of these
two types of sounds; as well, they preferred the smootheness between
words found in languages with terminal vowels on their words.  The
terminal vowel readily leads into the following word, especially if it
has an initial consonant.

   So, it is my intuition that the Glosa authors and Charlse percieved
Glosa words as predominantly of CVCV and CVCVCV structure, but that the
perception is based on different premises.

</bold>

<bold>**  # Gender vowels are only in languages with this unnecessary
item.

    # Again the rare CVC is featured in Glosa "function words", like
~qod~, ~sed~, ~per~, ~six~, ~jam~, ~tem~, ~sib~, etc

    # But I, for one, do not want to take the backward step, of adding a
P-o-S (part of speech) marking vowel, because, Glosa was predicated to
have "words that did not change for reasons of grammar."

    ## Part of the dictionary crisis was caused through Ron's declaration
(circa 1988) that the terminal vowel was of the speaker's choice ..
depending on what sounded right to him.  Soon after this section of the
Glosa experiment was started, and a number of preferred terminal vowel
usages were established, Ron and Wendy terminated the trial, having found
that sometimes the terminal vowel was the only letter separating Glosa
roots with otherwise identical spelling.

</bold>

<bold>*   As it can be seen, I do not agree with the ideas in these last
four lines of Charles's.

</bold>

>I do believe that a CVCV super-productive neutral language like

>Tunu can work. But, Glosa never abandoned use of the international

>(Euro-) vocabulary,

<bold>I guess that the Glosa authors wanted to keep their Glosa 'concept
words' (substantives) as close as possible to the Classical roots, from
which they were derived.  At the same time, they were also keeping an eye
on the way words came out in their subsequent, national-language
manifestations.

Their method was 'Pragmatic Intuitive' rather than algorithmic.

</bold>

>    and the Roget-1000 set is wholly inadequate,

<bold>At this stage, I have no proof that basing a language's fundamental
vocabulary on a generally agreed concept list is any worse, than
extracting the historically derived commonality from languages that
diverged from common sources over the period of thousands of years.

Clark and Ashby did not automatically select the English-language version
of a Roget concept: often the Classically-based English word was related
to many of the other Euro-language versions of a concept, and thus the
resulting choice was recognisable to speakers of English - as it was to
speakers of the other Euro-languages.

</bold>

<bold>Is there an academic argument against the Glosa authors basing
their foundation vocabulary on Roget's thousand concepts?

</bold>

>(At this stage, I don't K-ify the C-words, but that would

>certainly be possible in refining the process.)

>

<bold>I would guess, Charles, that you have a considered attitude against
the changing of the Latin words that are written with "C" spelling to a
"K".  However, from early in the piece, Ron and Wendy decided that there
were Hard "C"s and Soft "C"s, and they realised that their evolving rule
of Glosa spelling - each letter had one pronunciation - would make more
sense if the symbol for a Hard "C" looked different from that of a Soft
"C".

And, lo and behold, there did exist a symbol, which can be construed to
be a "c" with a stroke through it; and, hence, the Hard "C" was readily
written as a "k".  Meanwhile, of course, this decision would resolve two
other problems: the English Soft "CH" sound could be reduced to only one
letter, if Glosa adopted the Italian "C" sound, as it occurred in `ce-`
and `ci-`; then, the problem caused by the existence of almost identical
sounds in the Unvoiced "S" and the Soft "C" of English, was resolved by
declaring that this sound was to be conveyed by the letter "S" in=20
Glosa.

Needless to say, the puzzle of the Voiced "S" and the sound of the letter
"Z", was ^shaken out^ to result in the use of only one letter to
represent these almost identical sounds: "z".


I recall, on returning to Australia, in 1981, I visited the Professor of
linguistics at Sydney University, and showing him the Glosa dictionary
that I had brought from England: the words were all fairly recognisable,
because they looked very close to their Latin sources.

I tried to find this booklet in my Glosa archives box, but failed.=20
However, I did find a copy of Eduka-Glosa from Summer 1990: it contained
a copy of Glosa 1000 - as it was then - and the C/K distinction had been
made by that time; the wordlist has printed above the "C" entries, "Glosa
C pronounced like Eng. CH".

    If no-one has any objections, this will be the way to go - at least
until we get the standardised dictionaries sorted out.


It is all systems   go .... KI   or    KI .... go.


There is one formatting question: does your system allow the use of
Italicisation and Bold letters?  Does it treat the capitalisation of 

      <bold>KI

     </bold><italic> KI

</italic>and   KI

in the same way, or does it distinguish between them?

*  Charles and Glosa-pe in General, 
    I have not spent time learning Interlingua/Interlingue though I have
looked at these other languages during my time on the Conlang Mailing List.
 The samples I saw did not convince me that I should study the language(s)
but I could still be convinced that the Glosa group has much to learn from
the other initiatives in Planned Language.
    The whole question seems to turn on "word selection algorithms", and,
at present, these are moving into the areas of higher-level technology.
Are we in danger of leaving our 'constituency' behind, in the move to
establish professional credentials for Glosa?
    I will agree that Glosa gives the appearance of amateur effort.
However, that was where it started around thirty years ago, and I am not
convinced, yet, that higher technology, which could streamline and
regularise the language further, would necessarily create a language that
is more user-friendly than Glosa is at present.  Assume that to-morrow the
Good Fairy swishes her wand, and that we end up with a beautiful lexicon,
no sweat.
    Would such a thing solve most of the linguistic problems percieved in
Glosa.
    So, it is still my opinion that the intuitively derived Glosa
vocabulary works as it is, at present.  The matter of removing ambiguities
and unsuitable words, and adding missing ones should be a trivial exercise,
and one that should not cause confusion with Wendy; however, in discussing
the need for some revision of the vocabulary, we have moved from a minor
job to a major overhaul, which I personally feel is unwarranted.

    With reservations over the adversarial situation, of deciding words on
a vote, I am for going ahead with Kevin to set in place at least the
beginner's dictionary.  In statistical terms, I am likely to follow Ron, to
the grave, before discussions reach their conclusions, and before I can
happily publish Glosa as one language.  Do I want to I wait that long!?

    No, Glosa should not be the winner of a beauty contest, but it could be
finalised as a superior medium of communication within a year, or two, if
those interested in it and in the principle of world communication work
co-operatively and serendipitously.

    My guess is that you, Charles, can imagine that Glosa, as it stands, is
completed - with some inbuilt errors - and nobody takes it up.  In such an
exercise modern technologies would be overlooked, and a language that
solves no-ones problems might be consigned to the archives.
    However, I have had enough positive responses from places like Africa
and China, to convince me that the structure is sound.  I would like to
give the memory of Ron Clark and the energy of Wendy Ashby a chance to
demonstrate their creation is a viable language. 
    How can you convince the rest of us on the Glosalist that the
application of intense technology and radical revision of the language
would ultimately prove beneficial to the language and to mankind, in general?

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*   No way.  Mechanical methods might be good, and they could end up with a
Glosa that is the world's best communication medium, but there is no
guarantee of this.
    On the GIGO principle, automation is only as good as the instructions
(algorithm) fed in by humans.
    The method suggested by Kevin could not fail to produce a standardised,
and inevitably more usable, language.  
    With the use of programming methods to select vocabulary for
Interlingua/Interlingue, what was the final conclusion: did people
understand one another better using the mechanically improved vocabulary:
did new learners learn the language more quickly?
    In the case of taking raw glossaries of scientific terms or special
vocabularies from esoteric persuits, a standardised way of converting these
new words into Glosa would be greatly assisted by having a standardised,
well thought out way of doing it.  Such a set of instructions could well be
put into the form of a computer program, and terms could be fed in one end,
with Glosa-looking words coming out the other.  However, such Glosafied
terminology would need to be ^topped and tailed^ by Glosa-pe with
linguistic training, and probably then reviewed by a review board.

*   No memo.  Charles, through his understanding of the moving edge of
technology, and from his knowlege of the application of programming
technology to Interlingua/Interlingue is convinced that such an application
to Glosa will also standardise Glosa.  As yet, we are waiting to find out
the results of this high-tech approach within Interlingua/Interlingue: Has
it allowed people to understand one another better, and are people able to
learn the language more quickly?
    The Glosa authors did not use technology in the development of Glosa's
vocabulary: the authors used their minds inspirationally, looking at the
various national languages, checking this back to the Classical roots, and
testing the resultung vocabulary for sound and feel.  We will all agree
that, had they from early stage, used the basic technology of keeping a
base-lined lexicon on computer, little of the spelling variation that we
suffer from now, would have occurred.
    But, with the authors having done it the hard way, and come up with a
vocabulary that has been tested and reviewed by learners (Glosa's target
population), the current, hand-prepared vocabulary has proved that it
works, and does not need a lot of tweaking. 

>Someone asked how we could select a vocabulary by working

    Some say the Internet is anarchic: it is our job to learn how to
harness the initiative and enthusiasm of a bunch  of individualists so what
we get out of the system is greater than the sum of the individual inputs
into it.
    I have seen this method work successfully once before with the creation
of the Glosa Tense Table.  Each added his input to the table as he retyped
it and passed it on; there was no conscious plan to co-operate: each simply
added his thing, until the final version emerged, and it was more than any
of us might have imagined. 

    I am waiting for the first chunk.
    Perhaps we could learn from the more humanitarian ways of
decision-making.  Hard-edged decisions do not need to be made on every word
in the first round: there should only be one or two contentious words per
chunk, such that these can be left in Edward de Bono's "Po" until we've all
had a chance to have a second thought.

    I know that others have also created standardised wordlists, and I do
not want to appear partial.  With this concept, I would wish to check out
other people's basic lists (in the range 1000 - 2000 words) while going

   I am more of a concensus person: I'd rather allow us to BRIEFLY state
our objections to a word or spelling; and then, I might like to be able to
suggest the addition of a word that could be, but is not, in the chunk.
   Somehow, in terms of approval and authorisation, I'd say Wendy Ashby has
the power of veto.  So, I we want to keep as many people as happy as
possible, and maintain our official approval rating, we should avoid the
adversarial system, and we should also include Wendy in the deliberations.
   This might reduce time efficiency, but is more likely to enhance the
support of a maximum number of Glosa-pe.

*  Yep.  We have been coasting along at a snail's pace for months, so we
might not be up to such a rapid pace of progress: I feel that two days is a
bit of a short turn-around for volunteer labour.
   So, one ground rule I would suggest is that I post our standardised
chunks to Wendy regularly, though it will still be 'after the event.'

   If we use Kevin's list as the foundation, I would like to have the whole
list, and the chunk break-points in advance, so that I can consider the
lists at times that suit me, because my free time may not coincide with
divisions of the normal calendar.

    Perhaps from this experience, we will build on what we will have learnt
to refine the process to facilitate the processof coming up with the larger
standard dictionary.

*   Yes, mathematically, I can understand your need for rapid throughput:
how many starters will stay the distance, over four months?  If a chunk
takes twice as long, then we are in for an eight-month stint.  I guess your
haste is called for.

*   OK!  Charles has stated his reasons for using the upper and lower cases
.. as they are in the existing Glosa 6000 dictionary, so thats three in
agreement, so far.
    Using Word, I can change slope and embolden text, but I have not, as
yet, learnt to change case.  for me going from 
       kani     dog

to     KANI     dog

would involve retyping.

*  It is my belief, since spending time on Conlang, Auxlang and Glosalist,
that the key skill required for auxilliary language development is critical
thinking - rather than having a mind full of academic ideas about language.
   While I have both a small Greek dictionary and a small Latin one, these
are used in emergency, rather than as major sources for Glosa words.  As my
main tool, I do use the Glosa 6000 dictionary to check my recall of some
words.
   However, the whole thing about world communication is that it must be
fun, and it must work .. in a pragmatic, rather than an academic, sense.
So, I have been in touch with the Ugandans Ron and Wendy contacted, and
found their enthusiasm for a Lingua Munda refreshing.  Unlike
English-speakers who have the luxury of being able to commune across
oceans, Ugandans need a string of interpreters when they travel around
their own country, which is full of native languages.  They must be
wondering what is holding us up, with completing the language tool that
they need now for internal communication.

   The most significant recent piece of Linguistics, relevant to auxilliary
language formation, seems to be the discoveries about pidgins and creoles:
the formation of these trading and 'naturalised' languages is the closest
to the processes involved in  forming Planned Languages.  The first users
of pidgins and auxilliary languages are adults, who struggle to get their
minds around the foreign vocabulary and syntax; subsequent users are the
traders' children and primary-school pupils.  It is the young minds which
convert pidgins and auxilliaries into creoles and living languages.  So,
auxilliary languages must go through a similar two-step process to pidgins
and creoles.
   We, in the Glosalist are obviously in the first stage, which is
equivalent to pidgin formation: we cannot hope to have the plasticity of
mind we had when learning our native tongues; so we must do the best we can
in setting up the 'rules' for Glosa; but  must be prepared for the up and
coming, younger generation to 'normalise' and 'naturalise' the language
before it has the feel of a "native" tongue.
   In short, the present generation of adult Glosa-pe do not have the 'last
word.'  Only when children creolise it, can Glosa become a true living
language.

this is the address of part of my GE dictionary collection from various
sources - contains g1000, g6000, core and other stuff. There is some
repitition , similes, omissions etc but it might be useful perhaps. It
contains only words beginning with "a" as I had a lot of trouble trying
to get the full dictionary in.

The format is basically so that my computer could work on it. "+" is a
Glosa word, "*" is english and "^" is for comments. "r l x q " draw
attention to their presence in case they may cause problems for some
speakers, "PC" or "pc" indicate a plosive followed by another consonant,
again difficult for some speakers the numbers in "[]" show how many times
the word has appeared on glosalist or in PGN - and so on.

Do as you wish with it, if more is wanted I shall try to oblige - I have
the EG version also and it could be sent in bits if desired. I make no
claims for these offerings but they might prove useful in some way

*  I appreciate your concern, Sid,

   Some people do learn native languages that 'linguistically cripple'
them for learning new languages that make fuller use of the human vocal
range.


   However, I cannot see any sense in restricting the possibilities of
global communication for this reason.  The children of people whose
native languages lack P, L, N, Q and X will subsequently, as world
civilisation washes over them, develop the necessary vocal skills, or, if
not, will remain in a linguistic ^backwater^ with their parents.


  I am not being hard-hearted or cruel; this is just pragmatism at its
worst.


  My experience is from living in Cabramatta, the Asian enclace of
Sydney.  Jack can't really speak English: I am assured by other Chinese
immigrants that he comes from an area from which everyone has trouble
trying to learn English.  I met his wife and him the other day, with
their baby.  The child, going to school in Australia, will not suffer
linguistically as do its parents.  Su, a science teacher from China, does
not pass the telephone test for English.  He lived at my place for six
months during which time I attempted to coach him to improve his
pronunciation; however, it is now the same as it was when I first met
him.  After a visit to China, he returned with his wife and three
children.  While Su and his wife are failing with English, his children
would now be able to learn to speak Glosa.

   While I never thought it would go this far, I am quite surprised to see
that the heavy addition of tense does make the odd parts of speech appear
more understandable.

   However I still feel that the problem belongs to English, not Glosa.

   The Chinese have been struggling with a no P-o-S language for at least
one millenium, and it hasn't stopped them from comprising one sixth of the
World's population.

I started work on my word list last September. Since then,
*everything* I have written using Glosa, on this list and
elsewhere, has been confined to words and roots from that
list. 

That includes discussions of the language itself, computer
issues, etc. Speaking from experience, Glosa 1.5K works
just fine for everyday use. I think I'm about 50 words
short right now, but many of those missing words aren't
even in GID-Basic, so I've just worked around them using
multiple core words. 

I have absolutely no interest in abstract research.

For the most part, you have done a good job of describing
the process I had in mind when I wrote "vote" (in quotes).
I understand your desire to give Wendy veto power, and am
willing to try it, with a bit of reluctance.

A new chunk would be issued every two days. People could
wait and respond to a three-week-old chunk if they wished.
Of course, their input might not have as much impact if the
main discussion has already taken place.

It's ok, as long as:
1. It doesn't slow us down too much. I'm concerned that
additions might require more debate than tweaks and
deletions.
2. Everyone is ok looking ahead in the list. I suppose
that's actually true for deletions as well, so if we're
doing deletions in the first pass (and I would like to),
then we should probably do additions as well.

Robin and I have agreed, in principle, to a process that
should produce a roughly 1.5K "core" list of Glosa words.
However, this process will be most effective with
participation from other Glosa-pe (as many as possible). 

Is anyone else interested in participating? If I sent out a
chunk tomorrow, would anyone else respond?

I assume Charles does not like the proposed process. Does
anyone else have major concerns about it? 

Does anyone have a new proposal, different from Charles'
"algorithmic" method, and different from our proposed
"consensus" method?

    The person with IQ 110 can guess where the action is: "I" am a man, the
"house" is a brick box; do people have to be told that the funny word
between "me" and "home" is the 'action'?   No!

*  According to my "Gangster English Dictionary and Phrase-book,"
 the "I gun police down," statement is IQ 60 O.K.  But when we rise up the
IQ scale a bit, your self respecting IQ 110 gangster would know there was a
P-o-S marker missing.  He would obviously say:-
   "I gun da police down."
   While there is the sneaking suspicion that the "da" noun marker is
sitting on top of a silent "-ed" marker that fell off the word in front,
the same self-respecting IQ 110 gangster would only use a "did" before the
verb for emphasis, not for tense indication.
  EG  "Yeah Boss, I did gun da police down."
   And while this is all good Linguistic stuff, it has little relevance to
Glosa, because there will be no gangsters in Glosaland.

*  I still believe that in an uninflected language, it is more important
than in other languages, to indicate - using punctuation - the starting and
finishing of phrases and clauses: the likely suspects are the same as they
always were, commas, colons, and semi-colons.
   Well, in the "Glosa 1000" booklet of 1984, starting on p22, there are
 five pages about Verboids.  
EG esthe fatiga = tired; dona chromo = colour, stain; lose gyra = stops
spinning.  The first word is the verboid, and the second, which is not a
functioning 'verb', is called the "amplifier"; together they form a 'verb'.
   This form persists in presnt-day Glosa with words like 'gene', 'habe' 
'ki', 'dona' and 'dice', which can all take amplifiers, such as 'anti',
'tele' and 'akuto'.
EG  dice anti = malign; ki tele = go far; dona akuto = sharpen.

   In "Interglossa", starting at p171, there is a whole chapter of them,
EG  Fe acte grafo auto nomina in bibli.
    She is writing her name in the book.

   It is my belief that Clark and Ashby played down the verboid+amplifier
pairs, because they were too hard to explain, and made the dictionary
entries too complicated.
   The authors moved away from compounding roots with verboids to form
'verbs', and went towards the single substantive 'verb'.
EG Fe grafo fe auto nomina in u bibli.
   She writes her own name in the book.

  However, the form is retained in some concepts like "ascend."
EG  Fe pa ki ana u monta.
    She ascended the mountain.

*  I will agree that, apart from the Websites, Glosa dissemination is based
on fairly old technology.  
   We need cassettes, fun comics, and even games using Glosa.  Also, the
pictorial side, at present, does not even compete with the modern media.
   So, as well as making the learning of Glosa a fun activity, the whole
thing needs to be put onto a business basis: people who create Glosa
materials ought to be able to expect a royalties deal with the GEO; few of
us, these days, do something for no payment.
   Now that I have a laser printer, I will have to learn how to print small
booklets on it.  This means, of course I will have to create worthwile
content in a format suitable for printing on a lazer printer.

   What's better than letters after your name - everybody's got those, the

   The 'Grammar' Ron tried to avoid was page after tightly typed page of

   He did know that all language calls upon the mental function known as
'grammar,' but he tried to streamline the process so that we could leave
Glosa's grammar-load in the brain, where it always had been, anyway.
   It was only as a result of constant requests for hints on Glosa's
grammar that I attempted to tabulate it, deducing it from articles in the
PGN, as would an anthropologist on discovering a new native tongue.

Though we Glosa-pe do not want to imposed tense/mood/aspect distinction on
Glosa learners, I believe that it could be very helpful for those of us who
would write instruction in Glosa, to be aware of this tense/aspect divide.
Were you to give examples of the different English words, and equivalent
Glosa ones, in these three groupings, it could add new understanding to us,
concerning the unconscious mental functions that we, and others, use in our
formation of VERB PHRASES.

Sorry, I'm not qualified to teach.

It's not so complex; just the 3 tense particles, FU PA NU,
and the 2 aspects, DU and a missing particle I call "HA".
Every sentence should use one of them before the verb,
maybe use a pair of them when "precision" is desired.
Aspect particles act like the English -ING and -ED,
except they're pre-positioned instead of suffixed.

> Please make out a full line of possible contents of a VERB PHRASE.  I
> have not previously seen such a schematic representation of what could be
> happening in the middle of the sentence - between Subject and Object.

As I understand it, the verb phrase has several "slots" that can
be filled with certain particles or concept-words. Generally only 2
or 3 slots get filled, but it is possible to stuff in quite a few.

   [subject phrase]    [verb phrase]    [object phrase]
   The big black cat   was not eating   the white mouse.

So, ringing changes on the verb phrase, it's apparent that the
tense particles precede aspect:

   is eating, was eating, will be eating <--- NU DU, PA DU, FU DU vora
   has eaten, had eaten, will have eaten <--- NU HA, PA HA, FU HA vora

But from the glosaref.html examples, we know the negative particle
"NE" precedes the tense particles:

   wasn't eating <--- NE PA DU vora

Bickerton said the one essential mood particle is the "counterfactual",
which I take to be SIO in Glosa; it fits between tense and aspect:

   would have eaten <--- PA SIO HA vora

But now I'm troubled by the passive -- is it GE or ES or what?
Using 5 preverbal (auxiliary) slots we could say:

   the mouse wouldn't have been eaten <--- u mio NE PA SIO HA GE vora.

One can imagine an "intensive" companion for NE, maybe "JA".
Glosa has a bunch of so-called "modals" to accompany SIO,
but some don't look like true mood particles to me ... and
there are a bunch of "verboids" to consider, plus adverbs.
So, the entire scheme would be something like this:

1. negative NE, intensive JA
2. tenses: NU, PA, FU
3. modals: SIO, ...
4. aspects: DU, HA(?)
5. passive GE(?)
6. verboids
7. adverbs
8. the true verb

Slot #8 is obviously mandatory, and either #2 or #4 are also
needed for non-telegraphic sentences. The rest are optional;
use of more than a few would be rare and annoying.

Wheresoever this may be unclear, just refer to Bahasa ...

Yes, very clear, and I agree that HA would be a nice
addition.

Also very clear. Thanks for explaining it so well!

It seems to me that #2 is needed "quite often" (and I know
some folks would say it is only needed "rarely". Either
way, I think that #2 can usually stand without also having
a #4. Do others see it that way as well?

it wouldn't be complimentary.
   . The construction "u-mi" nouns the adjective, converting ~mi~ [my]
to ~u-mi~ [mine].  While I find it an awkward sounding construction, and
thus use it rarely, I think of 'u-mi' as 'the (of) me'.

>"Engelingua es mi matri lingua" -

*  This is obviously the way it should have been in the first place!
   Calling on the `Rule of Parsimony` we avoid any unnecessary
phrase-markers, and keep the ~mi~ simple, as it shoild be
   And, amazingly, this .. correct .. Glosa version maps directly onto the
correct English syntax!!!

>A Glosa phrase builds up to the head word - "matri" modifies >"lingua",
"mi" modifies "matri" 
*  This is the plain and simple story.  Why complicate it?

>This head is followed by modifying prep phrases

*  Although ^Uncle Tom Cobley and all^ will know from
        "Engelingua es mi matri lingua" 
that the speaker is talking about his own language, and that it is the one
he/she picked up from their first culture, not necessarily from the lips of
his/her own mother, in very obscure cases a distinction - as you indicate -
can be made, to avoid confusion.
   The Modifying Prepositional Phrases would be used, if such distinctions
were needed.

I've been putting together many of the words in various Glosa
dictionaries and trying with much trouble to get them on a web page. So
far there is the above address with the words beginning with "a", the
other letters are hiding in the wings. If anyone wants me to try more I
will do so. There is much to criticise in it  and a fair number of
omissions but it's a start of sorts.

From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Tue, 12 Feb 2002 15:51:23 EST

below - if this perishing thing behaves itself for a change- is an idea I 
shall work on for a tutor. It will be different from but complementary to 18 
steps. I have found tht many tutors etc sart you off with a long list of 
rules etc and bog your memory down - here you start with a sentence and an 
analysis follows - if analyses are not your cup of tea , the analysis can be 
skipped or skimped ....... 






"U an nima es Jon Smit e an nu eko in Glosa-landa".

Dictionary:-
an=he/his, e=and, eko=live/dwell, es=is, Glosa=Glosa, 
Glosa-landa(30n30u!)=30deg north,30 deg west(uest), in=in, Jon=a name, 
landa=land/country,  nima=name, nu=now, Smit=a name, u=a/the

His name is John Smith and he lives in Glosaland.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Construction:-
"u an nima" is the first word group, its main word is "nima"
"es" is the second word group
"Jon Smit" is the third word group, its main word is "Smit"
"u" introduces group one, it implies the number "one", there can be a number 
of names.
In group 3, there can be a number of "smit"s
"es" implies time, here it implies "now"
We have a number group, a time group and another number group
The first (number) group is the subject of the sentence.
The second(time) is the verb.
The third(number) is the object of the sentence.
S V O
The "an" in G1/S adds to the meaning of the main word "nima".
The "Jon" G3/O, adds meaning to the main word "Smit"

"nu eko" is G2/V in the second part of the longer sentence.
"nu" introduces V and implies the present time, "eko" is the main word of  V.
"an" is the subject(S), there is only one person.
"in Glosa-landa" is the object(O), "in" is an introductory word, "landa" is 
the main word and there is only one land, Glosa adds meaning to this main 
word.

"Si tu nu skope a tu carta bibli, tu fu detekti (; ke) Glosa landa pa no 
existe. "

a=to, bibli=book, carta=map, detekti=find, existe=exist, fu=future, no=not, 
nu=now, pa=past, si=if, skope=look, tu=you(singular) 

If you look at your atlas you will find Glosaland does not exist. The 
reference is in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean!

the sounds of IPA for Glosa will follow soon - I shall record them so there 
should be no copyright problem

I think that there is a glosa dictionary on the following improbable sounding

The dictonary is far from perfect but could be useful - it may go from a to e 
or even as far as z if Iam lucky. I think I've merged most of the stuff I 
could find up to about 6 months ago, if there are more places with more

And it's more difficult for me to read. I have to actually
bring the message up into MS Word in order to view the
message body, because it comes through as RTF.

Actually, that may be because I recently upgraded to a
newer version of my browser (I use web mail). Still, this
RTF stuff is really hard for me to work with.

Sid: Can you configure your email to only send "plain
text"? If you use Outlook or Outlook Express I can describe
how to do so.

Robin: Same question--can you only send plain text?

Subject: [glosalist] hyphens and dictionaries - problems
From: Sydpidd{at}aol{dot}com
Date: Thu, 14 Feb 2002 10:39:00 EST

What are we to do with hyphens in dictionaries?
If we include each word with its hyphens as one item, our dictionaries become 
almost impossibly large. If we omit the hyphens and use each hyphenated part 
as one entry, the dictionary becomes more manageable but we lose some 
independant items. Take "puta-me" (com-pute-r) for instance, we have "puta" 
and "me" ( think and mechanism) - "I am working with my think mechanism" ! 
"my with think doer". Would the word "putame" be acceptable? It would soon be 
recognised and would it matter if the word stress  came on the second 
syllable? "putAme". It is important for Glosa that (";" here?) there is a 
wide choice of expressions but from as small a word stock as possible
ad-in , ad in , adin
agri-vegeta , agri vegeta , agrivegeta (perhaps no mare than 5 syllables)
akti-seqe , akti seqe , aktiseqe
akti-verba , akti verba , aktiverba

In full Outlook, go to Tools/Options, and click on the
"Mail Format" tab. Change the "send in this message format"
drop-down to "Plain Text". This will configure Outlook to
send all message in plain text.

Alternatively, you can just change an individual message to
plain text while you are creating it. In the message create
window, there is a Format/Plain Text menu item.

In Outlook Express, you can configure individual entries in
your address book for plain text. Bring up the address book
entry, and check the "Send email using plain text only"
box.

I believe Outlook express also has one or both of the other
features I mentioned in Outlook, but I don't have it here
in front of me. I can check tonight if it will help.

If you're not using Outlook, can you tell us what app you
are using, so one of us might be able to give you specific
instructions for it?

Kevin

*  Thanks Marcel,
   I have printed out many of these files, and will be checking over ideas
of derivation, synonyms in "Core" and missing words.

   The last quarter of Simsyn will be incorporated soon, I hope.  
   Did you start working from the top?  And is the last quarter, to go, at
the tail end of the alphabet?

   Reckon we should wait until you finish this Simsyn --> GID upgrade
before attempting to compile a meld of all the Core Dictionaries.  Also
will communicate with Wendy to inform her of our plans.

I'm not sure I understand the problem with the current
approach, which is that the word list includes root words,
hyphenated words, and words connected with spaces. The
benefit is that it allows readers to make direct
connections between native language words and glosa
"phrases". 

I plan to continue with this approach in MiniG, unless
there is a problem with it. My list will probably have 500
roots and perhaps 1500 non-root entries consisting of more
than one MiniG word.

> Would the word "putame" be acceptable? 

In some cases, perhaps. But generally I strongly favor
keeping the hyphens. They allow for easier root
recognition, both written and spoken (because of accents,
as you mentioned).

Excellent. I will work my way through the MiniG words, and
try to keep them in sync with the GID where possible.

I like this concept. I think it could be very effective.

I assume this would not be the first entry, because it is
quite complex. If you build up to this slowly, it could be
great.

"Word derivation" ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/gwds.htm ):
  Here I was on the wrong way.  I just updated the file.  It should be
  simply like this -- if one likes it or not -- :

#  Glosa words are built from
#  - English foreign words, ...
#  - ... which have Latin or Greek origin and ...
#  - ... which have cognates in the other world languages Spanish,
#      French, German and Russian.
#  - Spelling is simplified (ph --> f, th --> t etc.). 
#  - And: Glosa words are mainly ending on a vowel.

"Synonyms in 'Core'": ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/cosyn.htm )
  http://www.glosa.org/gid/simsyn.htm is the file I am working on now.
  By this work, parts of the other "word-kitchen-files" have become
  obsolete.
  Removing synonyms of Core, Kevin did a great job, I think.  His work
  should influence all other word lists.

"Missing words" ( http://www.glosa.org/gid/gidmiss.htm ):
  A lot of the "missing words" belong to the simple circumstance, that
  English has more part-of-speek markers than Glosa.  E. g.
    > disappointment (disapunkta - disappoint; disappointment,
    >   but frustra - disappoint)
  ... should be easy to fix: frustra - disappoint, disappointment.

Ja.  (Though it happens often, that changes effect other changes on

Subject: [glosalist] GE and GENE
From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Fri, 15 Feb 2002 07:38:28 -0800 (PST)

Nick has suggested (in a private email), that ~ge~ and
~gene~ are redundant. That they both mean "get, become,
receive", and could be used interchangably. If that is the
case, I would drop ~gene~ and keep ~ge~.

I wanted to get other input on this. At first, they seem
quite different to me. One is "become", and the other is
"receive". But Nick suggested that to "become" is merely to
"receive" a new state. Because Glosa doesn't have different
words for different parts of speech, this actually does
seem to work.

  I become hot
  I receive hotness (heat)

  I become old
  I receive oldness (age)

He suggests that certain English uses of get could be
translated differently:

  I get angry
  I start feeling anger

  I become dead
  I stop living

Or (I can't think of an example now), in some cases "get"
might be translated as "change to" (~muta~).

Thoughts? Should I drop ~gene~?

Kevin

there seem to be 2 different constructions  for ge - ge-verb(aktiverba) and 
ge-noun to get an adjective - confusing.
I suggest that the ge-verb allows one to put the object at the front of the 
sentence - a useful device and that is what this use of "ge" is . U flora pa 
ge-dona per u andro - forget all this passive tense/aspect/mood stuff - the 
flower was the object  , after the verb, is still the object but before the 
verb. Further, If "ge" means that the first noun phrase was the subject, why 
not use it as a particle  immediately in front of the noun phrase it affects?

We need to distinguish between the "by" (source) ~ex~
and the "by" (means of) [instrument used] ~per~ 
markers.

~U flora pa gene dona ex andro per aero-posta.~

where the man is the ~dona-pe~ and 
so ~u dona andro~ 

and the flower is the  ~ge-dona-ra~ 
and so ~u ge-dona flora~.

The word order change, sid proposes, doesn't
seem to aid clarity greatly, but ~ge~ could
certainly be transfered to be used as an
object-displaced-to-before-the-verb
marker, if this is liked.

Can you give some examples? Theoretically, almost 
any Glosa word can be either verb or noun, so is 
there really a difference?

A flower was get-gifted by a man. This particular 
example sounds confusing because 'give' and 'get' 
are natural opposites in English. We should 
probably use a different example to discuss this 
case.

U kani pa vora u flora
U flora pa ge-vora per u kani

A flower was get-eat by a dog
A flower became ate by a dog

> forget all this passive tense/aspect/mood stuff -

That is one way to look at it. But it seems like 
a more complicated way to me, for some reason.

Ge flora pa vora per kani

(Passive) flower eat by man. Hmmmmmm. Seems hard for me to
parse. If ge is modifying the verb (which I still think it
is), then it should go near the verb. Very few things in
glosa affect the whole sentence (qe is the only one that
comes to mind).

~per~ is still wrong here, (say I pedantically).
It should be

~U flora pa gene vora ex kani.~

Compare

~U flora pa gene vora ex andro per kultela e furka.~
A flower was eaten by a man with/using a knife and fork.

~ex~ the source of the action, the "do-er"
~per~ the means by which it was done, the "tools"

The dog did the swallowing, so it is the "do-er".

Hmmm. While probably technically correct, it is hard for me
to mentally translate ~ex~, (which I think of as meaning
'out from') as 'into'. Because ~ex~ and ~extra~ have a
similar sound, I mentally hear:

 The flower was eaten out of a dog. (yuck!)

Perhaps it should be:

  U flora pa gene vora a u kani.

or

  U flora pa gene vora in u kani.

  U flora pa gene vora a u andro per u furka.
  U flora pa gene vora in u andro per u furka.
  U flora pa gene vora de u andro per u furka.

or

  U flora pa gene vora per u andro; uti u furka.

or

  U flora pa andro gene-vora.
  U flora pa andro gene-vora per u furka.

Actually, I would probably just turn it around:

  U andro pa vora u flora per u furka.

It is reasonable (in my mind) for a language to discourage
OVS structure.

From: Kevin Smith <kevinbsmith{at}yahoo{dot}com>
Date: Sun, 17 Feb 2002 08:51:35 -0800 (PST)

I just noticed the Glosa sample at:
  http://www.sys.uea.ac.uk/~jrk/conlang.html

First, it seems to have a sentence structure that I do not
recognize. Second, it does not seem to use "modern" Glosa
vocabulary. Shouldn't we submit an updated fragment?

  Mi pote qe kompar tu ad estiva di?
    Tu es ma kali, e ma modera.

Here's the translation, without which I would have
scrambled to grab the GID word list:

  Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
    Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

kompar: not in GID
estiva: 1+G (vice termo-tem 1++)
modera: no 1, +, or G

It doesn't help that the original text seems to rely on the
ability of the English word 'temperate' to be applied both
to weather, and also to personality in a complimentary way.

Also, the link to Marcel's site doesn't mention that it is
now available in English, and links to an old URL that
requires a redirect.

I assume Marcel can submit a correction for his link. Can
someone choose a new sample, run it by the group to make
sure it is a good example of how we wish to present Glosa
to the world, and then submit it?

It's all about the marketing, folks.

This is an extract from
http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell/shakesp.htm
a page prepared for the Web by Paul O. Bartlett, (1996)
from "PLU GLOSA NOTA" n. 69, Novembra/Decembra 1994

Poetry never obeys the normal rules of syntax, and has a
vocabulary all of its own. The translation is trying to copy
the rhythm as well as convey the meaning.

I agree, a more standard Glosa sample would be preferable.

Saluta,
Nick

Thank you for the advice (My fault: I was sure, I have mailed him.
Now I scanned my "sent messages", and recognized, that I wrote to him
before I had the new domain.).  I will write to him swiftly.  Please
suggest a better sample.  What about:

I would prefer plastika.  "plasti-ma" is not useful, as long plasti is
not in Core (see Kevin's method-page), and it is not clear
("form-material", at first site I would think it is plasticine).
I will change it in my word list in the next update:

  platika --> gets X (expired)
  plastika --> new item, gets ++*G (new Core-word)
  plasti-ma --> new item, gets only G (Greek origin)

Please write, if you do not agree.  Thank you.

Perhaps 'ex' should really be 'extra de'? Otherwise, this
seems reasonable.

Lots of very small words, which has pros and cons.

This has several words that aren't in Glo, so I like it
less.

Does 'eko' really not require a preposition, because the
'in' is built in? It sounds strange to me. Also, I would
put another 'u' after proxi, but then I generally err on
the side of too many articles rather than too few.

Of these, I think I guess 'Paris' is my favorite. I'll take
a look at 18 steps and the GBR and see if I can spot any
other candidate passages.

Kevin

We have 2 main noun phrases. S and O
normally the order would be SVO, sometimes we want to change that order to 
OVS.
If the particle "ge" is in the verb phrase, the order is OVS, if there is no 
"ge" particle, the order is SVO. There is no need for "per" nor "ex" to 
express passive/ word order change.
U kani pa vora plu flora - Plu flora pa ge vora u kani

I know English and no doubt others mess about with the verb phrase and add 
"by" to what was the S, But there is no need for Glosa to slavishly imitate 
E.
The flowers were/are being eaten by the dog - the Glosa is much neater.

I'm not feeling very creative this morning. Here are a few
more candidates out of 18 steps. I'm not sure I like any of
them better than 'Paris', but they all seem reasonable to
me. Some words might have to be cleaned up.

On further reflection, it would be nice to have an upbeat
sentence, so let's not go with dying fish.

But it can also be used with an adjective:
  ~ge-grafo~ = written. 

There is no SVO context at all here--just a word, so the
ge- rule can't be quite that simple.

But it looks like it is? the 'active' form of written (excuse me, i'm not so well 
in English grammar) is writing isn't it?

a writing man
a written letter

so, if you more precisely say:

if you apply ge- on a glosa word used as a verb, it conserves the very same sence 
of the verb with the only difference, that in sentences S and O are exchanged 
with adding the necessary helpverbs and prepositions: (excuse me again, i joined 
glosa only a few days ago):

a person writes a letter
u pe grafo u grama   

a letter iswrittenby a person
u grama ge-grafo u pe

and this adjective would not be written but bewrittenby, so

a writing person
a bewrittenby letter

this is what i think glosa means by simple concepts

(Here are some semi-technical terms to play with.)

> We have 2 main noun phrases. S and O normally the order would be SVO,

There is always one main noun phrase, the SUBJECT/TOPIC.
The rest of the sentence is called PREDICATE/COMMENT.
Glosa chooses the most common alignment, known as
TOPIC-COMMENT or SUBJECT-PREDICATE phrase order.

> sometimes we want to change that order to OVS.

We can use HEAVY TOPICALIZATION via LEFT DISLOCATION:
"The canary, the cat ate it." But there are two other ways
to do it, a bit more complicated.

Using prepositional CASE MARKERS we can rearrange more
than just the S and O, and mesh more smoothly with the
DISLOCATIONS above: "About the canary, the cat ate it."
"To the cat, I give the bird." "In the cage, a canary was."

The 3rd possibility is use of grammatical PASSIVE VOICE:
"The bird is given to the cat by me." English and Glosa
both seem confused about which particle to use for this,
BE/GET or ES/GE(NE).

> But there is no need for Glosa to slavishly imitate E.

CASES (prepositions) are needed anyway, to distinguish
the different passive constructions. It's even possible
to eliminate the COPULA and VOICE particles entirely.

> dogs are not daft

Not if they're cats. (How many "core" animals would
the vocabulary minimizers allow onto their ark?)

In my unofficial core list, I had about 20 fairly specific
types of animals. 

In Glo, I have none. It just seems unfair to include 'cat'
just because "we" happen to keep them as housepets. Or to
include 'horse' but not 'elephant' and 'camel', which serve
a similar purpose in other parts of the world. Once you
start including specific animal names, where do you stop?

If you need to refer to an animal that doesn't have a name,
you can describe it: "big grey long-nose working animal".
You can also give it a name at the same time that you
describe it for the first time. "This is a story about
three Ursu. An ursu is a large, furry animal that can be
very ferocious".

Now I have just mailed to Richard Kennaway and suggested

1) An ne pa pote memo plu verba; seqe-co an pa merka u
   verba-bibli.
   [He couldn't remember the words so he bought a dictionary.]
2) Tem na pa eko in Paris; mu pa visita na bi kron.
   [While we were living in Paris, they visited us twice.]
3) Plu piski pa lose bio; kausa un aqa pa ki ex piski-va.
   [The fishes died because the water leaked out of the tank.]

I wonder, which (or whether) he will choice.  Greetings - Marcel

I feel that if we have a particle that tells us the construction, it would be

And it's more difficult for me to read. I have to actually
bring the message up into MS Word in order to view the
message body, because it comes through as RTF.

Actually, that may be because I recently upgraded to a
newer version of my browser (I use web mail). Still, this
RTF stuff is really hard for me to work with.

Sid: Can you configure your email to only send "plain
text"? If you use Outlook or Outlook Express I can describe
how to do so.

Robin: Same question--can you only send plain text?

And it's more difficult for me to read. I have to actually
bring the message up into MS Word in order to view the
message body, because it comes through as RTF.

Actually, that may be because I recently upgraded to a
newer version of my browser (I use web mail). Still, this
RTF stuff is really hard for me to work with.

Sid: Can you configure your email to only send "plain
text"? If you use Outlook or Outlook Express I can describe
how to do so.

Robin: Same question--can you only send plain text?

Grati,

Kevin

Subject: [glosalist] Regarding Word .doc files and plain text, etc.
From: <hzi{at}uol{dot}com{dot}br>
Date: Thu, 21 Feb 2002 19:11:58 -0200 (BRST)

Hello-

	Please remember that Microsoft Word .doc files are not an
international standard, because it is a "closed" (i.e., proprietary)
standard. Is is not an internationally recognized and adopted
technical standard.
	Only users of the Microsoft Operating System can view these
files properly (also, Word-compatible products). Windows is not the
only operating system in widespread use today, even though you might
think it is. 
        Word files are also inadequate: they waste too much disk space
and bandwidth. If you, like me, must triage 500-plus e-mails a day, you
do not want them taking close to 10 times the amount of space and
bandwidth that is really necessary.
	Additionally, from a technical point of view it is an
unreliable format, with horrible backporting. No garantee you will be
reading your files in, say, 10 years time. Plus, they are a well-known
ideal media for the spreading of viruses.
	So in respect for those that are not victims of that monopoly,
please choose to send your files in internationally accepted
communication formats: you might send the in plain text, or, in the
case special formatting is needed, send an HTML file.
	Word files are easily converted to HTML. Just choose "Save
As..HTML" and we'll all be fine.
	Please be so kind as not to "push" your choices to other
people. This is nothing but good old Netiquette.
	
	Thank you,

	Henry

   Such contractions have caused the devil of a problem in Esperanto.

   Please note: we do not hear the actual hyphen in spoken language;

but, the space it occupies represents a BREAK in the sound.  So, in the
same way that "break-in" and "breakin'" are sounded differently in
English, then ~puta-me~ and ~putame~ will be sounded differently in
Glosa!

   If my e-mail program's 'underlining' works on your computer, you will
see that the first Glosa word has two accented vowels, while the second
Glosa word has only a single, but different, accented vowel.         


        p<underline>u</underline>ta-m<underline>e</underline>     versus

*   No!  The use of a semi-colon in Glosa before a relative pronoun is to
^signpost^ the start of an ADJECTIVAL CLAUSE.

    EG  An dice de Glosa; qi habe boni soni, dona hedo a mi oti.

                      ^   [ ..............]   Clause modifies "Glosa"

N.B.                                       [ xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx ] This

I disagree with him, and that I believe the hyphen - in joining roots in
a compound - has semantic/syntactic value equivalent to that of the
normal marks of punctuation.

*  All I can say is that meaningful conversation and enjoyable letters

   I could try to exchange experience and ideas with someone using a
"toy" vocabulary, but I would soon tire of the exercise because of
lexical restrictions, and also, because I would find myself being
repetitious.

   All that being said <<ko dice-co>, I do understand that learners of a
language prefer to get into using it, by starting with small, meaningful
chunks: I prefer to think of Kevin's "MiniG" as a first chunk of Glosa. 
People can happily absorb this small, 500-word, vocabulary, and start
making valid sentences using it.

   As long as MiniG is a subset of Mega-Glosa, then everything works:
people can grow in Glosa usage by additively progressing from the
smallest vocabulary to the next, and so on.  With such a scenario,
uncertain learners could try themselves out with MiniG, then, as their
confidence grew, they could expand their usage to "Core Glosa", meanwhile
understanding more of Glosa's syntactic possibilities, as well.

   Adventurous souls would soon discover the need to expand their lexical
range beyond that of Core's 1500 words, and would obviously buy (or
download) the vocabulary that was the next step up, possibly a 'Mega
Glosa' or a 'Glosa 5000'.

   As long as the spelling and word range in all of these vocabularies
was consistent and additive, then we would have a comprehensive range of
vocabularies, and people could develop linguistic confidence in their use
of Glosa, in a progressive manner.

   I trust that the thoughts I have expressed, here, are congruent with
the thoughts of others on the List.


   Such graduation, within the Glosa-learning process, could cause
further complications for Wendy .. in the preparation of Plu Glosa Nota. 
But, we would have to find the ceative way around such a challenge.


Saluta,


Robin

*  I agree completely with Kevin.
   This sentence should be given as two separate ones to begin with.

   If this was to be a group effort, what sort of decision-making process
would work?
   For instance,  ~U an nima ~  is not the way I would say it:-
    . I'd start with ~An ~,
    . The GID favours ~nomina~ over ~nima~, and I tend to get with the
strength on this sort of thing.

   And then there's the question of which 'verb' goes with "having" a name!?
   I have thought that  ~An habe u nomina, Jon Smit, ~  is more in the
spirit of Glosa than using the 'name = Jon Smit' formula.

   So there, I haven't even got half-way through the sentence and I am
'quibbling' over usage.  Is there a workable formula to streamline the
process of finding the most suitable usage?  And can such a formula include
Wendy Ashby in an adjudicator's role?

   On the question of teaching strategy, I imagine that earlier sentences
might be:

      U-ci es u persona.

      An eqa un andra.   OR    An es un andra.

   Without going on further, I wonder what method we could adopt to 
come up with a teaching book that satisfies all.
   While the majority of Glosa effort has been put into the lexicon, when
are we to sort out the syntax and usage?

   If we, as a group, have trouble in reaching consensus on the usage, then
the language will not work.  Most learners will take the usage that is
given to them, and will not attempt to creatively vary such given language.
 Were the members of this List to reach agreement among ourselves on the
usage, then the syntax we demonstrate, will be taken up by other learners
... as it stands.

   The question remains: can we Glosalistas come to agreement on how the
language should be used!?

Saluta,

Robin

Of course, I still disagree about this, but I know I won't
be able to convince you. 

I agree that using an occasional non-core word to express a
specific or complex concept, makes sense. My concern is
that by having a large vocabulary available, and using it,
we will force readers to have to learn more of the language
than necessary. 

Frequent use of non-core words may be poetic, but it
impedes the flow of information. And for me, the ONLY
reason to be using an IAL instead of a native language it
to maximize the flow of communication worldwide.

I do believe this is important, but also feel fairly
strongly that the few "radical" word changes I have made in
Glo should remain. If they are adopted by Glosa, that would
be ideal. If not, I suspect that Glo will remain slightly
different. Note that this only covers about five words, and
the Glo versions of those words should be recognizable by a
Glosa-pe.

As an aside, I would now propose that if the group is going
to step through a "core" word list, that we should step
through the Glo word list. At least in theory, those most
core of core words should be ones that we all agree should
be in the language, and they tend to be ones with fewer
questions about spelling and meaning.

Kevin

   'I wish to hear from you' is an English-language idiom.

   ~audi~ & ~auxi~ are not the same category of things, so do not work
with the conjunction, ~e~.  Possibly:  Mi fo volu auxi, e vo gene ex tu
plu verba; tu puta ... ~ 


    In Glosa 6000, ~klu~ = "even".  I feel that ~inklude~ is the right
word, here.

*  I wondered about the generics, which were not mentioned in the
Mini-Glosa file: are they intended to be used in MiniG?

   These compounds, which would be necessary to describe airplane and
milk, are better left out of MiniG: as a very first vocab, there would be
plenty of 'Mega Glosa' words to play with; also, such compounds add
confusion, in that they would have to be unlearnt, and replaced with the
MG words, when the learner expanded his vocab to 'Core' or 'Mega 
Glosa.'


  Either MiniG is presented without the possibility of compounding and
the use of hyphenated generics, or it includes these higher-level
constructions.

  In the former case, learners would be introduced to the generics and to
the art of compounding, when they moved on from MiniG to something more
comprehensive; if, on the other hand, the art of the hyphen is included
in MiniG, it could cover only some listed compounds, or it could cover
listed compounds plus the generics (-pe, etc), however such inclusions
would detract from the elegance of MiniG as a non-inflecting,
non-compounding "toy" language.


  I, at present, see MiniG as a sort of ^piglet Latin^ version of Glosa. 
After completing, later to-day, <italic>Tri Ursus - in MiniG, </italic>I
will be in a better position to tell if this impression is the right
one.

According to the Eudora user manual (available from their
website):

You can select your preferences for sending text by going
to the Tools menu and choosing Options. Scroll through the
category list and select Styled Text. There, you can choose
'plain', 'styled', or 'both'. For this list, 'plain' would
be best, and 'both' (which is the default) should be ok,
but doesn't seem to be.

Note that by choosing 'plain', you will lose the ability to
underline, bold, set colors and fonts, etc.

The other important thing is to never send a message as an
attachment. If you edit the message outside of Eudora, copy
and paste it into the Eudora message creation area instead
of attaching it.

This is an excellent question. And I would propose a
similar solution to my proposal for 'regularizing' the
vocabulary: Take a tutorial, work through it in chunks, and
attempt to build consensus. The tutorial could be 18 steps,
Glosa Basic Reference, or any new tutorial that Sid or
anyone else has created by the time we were ready to begin.

I'm inclined to think that vocabulary should come first,
because then we won't have to quibble (as much) about word
selection when we are trying to focus on syntax and
structure.

    The hyphen both maintains the integrity of the language, and informs us
that a compound has been formed.  Also, it leaves the reader in no quandry
as to the pronunciation of the constructed 'word.'

    Urgently, here, I put in a case for POETRY.  People will want to
write poetry using Glosa - using the language to convey the nuances of
meaning that the poet relishes.  So, the difference between 'stopping
living' and 'becoming dead' could be the crux of a whole poem: do we have
the right to deprive future generations of the subtlties permitted by
having a range of meanings in the semantic catalogue?

    In the same vein, creative communicators will wish to hold the
thought that their prose, in Glosa, as in other languages, can be
described as having poetic quality.  If we are to be "lexical
economisers", we might also function as "creative writer excluders."


>Or (I can't think of an example now), in some cases "get"

>might be translated as "change to" (~muta~).

>

*   For poetry, again, I would argue that there are many cases when the
concept of "change" is not interchangable with that of "becoming."  And
in a more mundane argument, I would suggest that these two concepts often
work, syntactically, in different ways.

    :A hot day:

         Id gene termo.

         U-c di pa habe fo termo.

         Nu-di, u meteo du muta ex frigi a termo.

         U di es termo.

         Nu, u temperatura eqa mo hekto grada.

         

>Thoughts? Should I drop ~gene~?

>

*   NO!

    And ~ge-~ is a perfectly legitimate abbreviation of ~gene.~

    While the use of ~ge-~ as  prefix represents the only bit of
inflection in Glosa - whereby tense (aspect or mood) modification is
attached to the substantive 'verb' - it does overcome an otherwise sticky
problem: the participle in Passive Voice.


   EG  U bola pa bate an.     An pa gene ge-bate ex u bola.

Certainly we do. (I write that about half with sarcasm, and
half with seriousness). As language designers, we choose
whether or not there is a word for the little flap of skin
between your toes. We choose whether to have different
words for wet snow and dry snow.

The degree to which we include synonyms in the language
goes right to the heart of why we believe one would use an
IAL. And you and I already know that we disagree on this
point. I trust and hope that this particular issue will not
prevent us from continuing to work together in other ways.

> If we are to be "lexical economisers", we might

If so, I could live with that. On the other hand, a
language with fewer words can require great creativity to
construct a sentence with just the right meaning. And
Glosa's (and Glo's) ability to interchange parts of speech
allows still more options.

Perhaps when I get back to translating the Tao into Glo I
will change my mind, but I doubt it. Of course, we must all
remember that I am only setting the course for Glo, and not
for Glosa. I expect Glosa will always retain its 2000 to
6000 word vocabulary.

Up until that point, I was pretty much planning to leave
them both in, with ~gene~ meaning obtain, and ~ge~ meaning
become and/or handling the passive voice. But as soon as
you tell me that they are interchangable, I feel an
uncontrollable urge to remove one of them.

Respectfully,

Kevin

*  I find that syntax is the final arbiter in Glosa.
   By syntax, I mean the natural order of the words; and by 'natural order'
I think of the way that the mind prompts us to sequence the symbols of
thought, which we call words.

   IE     "Ge flora pa dona per andro"
 glos.  [got-done flower did give by man]       
           Flower was given by man.*

     Note, in trying to make this unthinkable glos seem like English, I had
to import a VERB: this was "to be" in the form of 'was.'

     When Ron Clark acknowledged the need for a Passive Voice in Glosa, he
chose the construction:- 

         GOT/GETS  X-ed/en

      Now "get" is a perfectly respectable English word, and ~gene~ is a
fair representation of it.  So, Ron, harking to German, where, it seems,
the "-ed/en" of English is given as "ge-", he did some quick cross-breeding
of the languages, and declared that the abbreviation of ~gene~ , like some
weird "getted" or "gotted", would make the action into a particle, and thus
~ge-akti~ was "done".

  EG   An pa akti id.
       [he did do it]
        He did it.

       Id pa gene ge-akti ex an.
       [it did get en-act from him]
        It got done by him.   

  I find that the three-line example satisfies me in such a way that I can
relate my thinking in Glosa to my thinking in English.

  As long as the middle line, called the 'glos' in linguistics, relates
clearly upwards to the Glosa, and downwards to the English vernacular form,
I can see, imagine, and feel the relationship between the two languages.

  One trick is to be speaking (or writing) in Glosa and to be thinking in
English (or other native tongue) at the same time.  This is not
recommended; however, if it is possible, then a logic can be percieved in
Glosa, and the language makes sense.
  If there is no sensation of relativity between Glosa and a person's
native tongue, then he cannot develop a confidence in Glosa's rules, and
cannot learn to 'think' in Glosa; consequently, we would have to admit that
the Glosa Project had failed.

  On the other hand, if the syntax-based language, Glosa, can be shown to
have a satisfying, and people-friendly system of syntax - that can be
related to that of people's native languages - then there is still hope for
the Glosa Project.

I have not, as yet, seen a better Passive form, for Glosa, than that
concocted by Clark and Ashby.

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

Yes, in my mind there was a stronger marker before the e.

GID lists klu as: even; even (including); even (still);
including; still (even)

In Glo (formerly MiniG), generics are no longer a special
case. As with Glosa, you can add a hyphenated root to the
end of any other root or word. In Glo, I eliminated those
generics that conflicted with regular words (mo, te, ka),
and those that didn't seem very useful (zo). Others (fa,
fi) have become full words, and so can be used as generics,
or as regular words.

Why? Aside from the issue that ~go~ is not a Glosa word,
would it ever be incorrect Glosa to refer to a plane as
~vola-go~ (or ~vola-vagona~)?

Glo includes a core set of about 500 roots. Having learned
these, it should be possible to understand whatever
compounds a Glo author has chosen to use. I do not see the
conflict. 

It is important to have the compounds in Glo to give
writers ideas for how to translate English words into Glo
when there isn't a Glo root that meets the need. I have
split the Glo materials to have a separate "root word
list", as opposed to the list that also includes compounds.

Glo will be able to stand as a language on its own. It is
certainly not a "toy", nor is it intended to be training
ground for people on the way to Glosa (although some people
may end up using it that way, which would not bother me at
all).

I eagerly await your Glo version of Tri Ursu.
Unfortunately, Glo is a bit of a moving target at the
moment--I am still adding or removing perhaps two or three
root words a day. I'm assuming you will encounter some
words that you feel you cannot do without, and those would
be candiates for addition to Glo.

I also overhauled the internal storage of my website, so if
you had bookmarks to the old MiniG materials, you'll need
to update them.

Use compounds. Glo compounds are _suggestions_, not words.
As long as the reader can figure out what is meant, it
makes no difference whether your compounds are from the Glo
list or not. Just like Glosa.

If you like ones that I have listed, feel free to use them.
If not, make up your own, as long as they literally and
unambiguously convey your meaning. If you invent some good,
logical compounds, I'll want to add them to Glo.

My goal is to have a list of Glo compounds that covers at
least a few thousand English words. I'm up to about 2500
already. Most of the growth in Glo over the next few weeks
(?) will be in the form of added compounds.

--=====================_1014646243==_
Content-Type: text/plain; charset="us-ascii"

Mi Plu Amika,
  Here is a progress report: it is taking a little longer than expected -
with finding alternative, more generalised words - to replace the broader
Mega Glosa language of "Tri Ursus," but this is what it looks like so far.

  Yes, I AM struggling with the 500-word "toy" language of Mini Glosa, and
seriously suspect that five hundred words might be not enough.  Kevin's
selection of words, also, could be skewing this miniture vocabulary away
from an easy treatment of the mythical pastoral scene, when bears roamed
the forest of Europe.

 # I had trouble traslating "Tri Ursus" to "Tri Bruno Zoa" because of the
lack of the following words:-
    foresta
    ursus
    tabla
    spatula
    vesti
    sed
 
 # I took the liberty of adding some words because alternatives could not
be found, and they could not be otherwise constructed:-
    ju-fe
    voci
    plura 
    flori
    place

  As far as I can judge, such a miniture language would be beneath the
dignity of most adults, but would provide endless fun to children.  For
this reason, I believe that ~ju-fe~ and ~ju-an~ should be in it, together
with ~juve.~  The natural world got too brief a look in for me, with too
few parts of the body, many natural daily activities not covered, and parts
of the day plus seasons of the year absent.
  While I'm not saying that telling children's stories is the main part of
Glosa's task, I would suggest that it is an excellent place to start; and,
also, the case for Glosa will be won, or lost, in the primary-school
classrooms of the world.  Eventually, IF those in charge decide to run off
a trial, of the short-list of Auxilliary languages, the test population
will not be Linguistics Professors, but primary-school children from around
the world: I believe that our "Starter Vocabs" should be purposely designed
to be 'child friendly' for this reason.

The first third of "Tri Bruno Zoa," which ought to be in the body of the
message, and which was typed using Wordpad, follows: ........

As we discussed, specific animals are problematic in any
language with a small vocabulary. Even in full Glosa, we
don't distinguish between breeds of dogs, for example.
Bruno-zoa seems fine.

plano-stru [Note: The use of ~stru~ here may be the most
controversial Glo root yet. I wanted a word that covered
both furniture AND fixed appliances and implements (such as
a bathtub or fireplace). 

~mobili~ was too long (since furniture is so common), and
~-mo~ conflicted with ~mo~. So the current word ~stru~
means "constructed item, furniture, fixture, implement
(n)". 

If Glosa-pe feel it is too misleading to redefine ~stru~
this way, and if nobody can come up with an existing Glosa
word to fill this purpose, then I might end up having to
invent my first ever Glosa root.

Thanks for submitting it in pieces. It helps me get a sense
of direction. My initial cut of words was done VERY
quickly, so I'm still trying to sort out the final list.
Originally, for example, I was woefully short of materials
and textural qualities. Hopefully most of the major gaps
have been filled, but I still have a pending list of about
20 major concepts that I'm trying to figure out how to add
in a sensible way.

will be able to read it.

That's impossible; more plausible would be:
"U flora pa es dona per un andro".

Actually, GENE appears to be a "passive voice particle",
whereas GE is a "passive participle". GENE can now be
confused with ES, and users can wonder if there is also
an active participle (as in English). I'd prefer to:

1. drop GENE and instead use ES (for the passive voice)
2. keep GE but also use DU (for the pair of participles)

In that case, "es dona per" would be sufficient.
The "participles" might also serve as the "aspects",
but it would need testing ... still not comfortable
with the placement of the passive voice particle:

U flor pa es ge dona per/ad Jo.  =  A flower had been given by/to Jo.
U flor pa es du dona per/ad Jo.  =  A flower was being given ...
U flor pa es dona per/ad Jo.     =  ...  was given by/to Jo. (no aspect)

Just idle speculation, of course. (Jo was a unisex nonce-name.)

Thank you very much for this. I found it to be very clear
and well-written. I have a large number of suggestions,
some of which are specific to Glo, others which would also
apply to Glosa, and some which areas that my own language
skills are lacking.

I took a quick glance at the original Glosa version, and I
find this Glo version to be much easier to read. Perhaps
that's just me. I would be interested in comparisons from
other folks, especially after my Glo suggestions have been
incorporated (or not, at Robin's discretion).

I don't have the ability to add an attachment to this
email, so I'll paste my comments (entwined with the story
itself) below.

Again, thanks for doing this Robin. It's great. I'd love to
put it up on my website when you finish.

translation.

k: I like ~dendro-area~ better than my earlier
~poli-dendro-loka~.

k: Should this be ~pa eko~? "There were 3 bears" seems
literal.

Mu pa habe eko intra u pusi do intra u pusi aperi loka:
k: ~do~ indicates a building. I'm not sure if they really
lived in a building, or if this is a cave (~kavita~), or
perhaps just a living place (~eko-loka~).

holo proxi u do pa habe plu alti dendro.  
k: I have added ~peri~. I'm not sure if I'll keep ~alti~.

Ex u do, u steno via pa duce inter plu dendro.
k: Perhaps ~pasa~ or ~kurva~ instead of ~duce~?

Singo proto de di, 
k: ~Sing[u]~. Could be ~di-proto~. I've also added
~heli-proto~ and ~pre-meso-di~, but I like ~proto~ better
in this context.

k: I like ~proto-di-vora~ better than my current ~pre-di

just be: ~Mo termo xanto-tem di,~?

un an-parenta bruno zoa

never change form based on words around them. We don't
change ~plu ungu~ into ~plun ungu~, so why have exceptions
for certain words?

why new is here at all. Is this really a new summer? Or is
this an "Indian summer" taking place in the autumn? (USA:
"Indian summer" is a re-warming 
in mid- to late-autumn).

better than ~tegu~.

Later in the story, it is clear they do live in a building,

I now see that he wasn't merely choosing. He was dictating
that the family WOULD walk. So ~judika~ still works, or
perhaps you could work ~krati~ in somehow.

Thanks, sid, for the miss-attribution!

I was quoting Robin, and saying that there
should not be a ~ge-~ in this sentence in 
standard Glosa.

ie  it should be ~An pa gene bate ex u bola.~


Personally, I don't see a compelling reason
for the change you are proposing, but I 
agree, it is quite possible to do things in
this way, with ~Ge~ marking an inverted
word order sentence paralleling ~Qe~ marking
the change from normal word order to question.

Saluta,
Nick

An pa gene bate ex u bola.~
I agree, we don't need both ge and gene, in this sentence "gene" tells me 
that the subject/object order has been reversed - passive voice/tense/mood 
etc are needless complications in explanations
I was suggesting that "ge" or even "gene" at the front of the sentence echo 
the particle at the beginning of a phrase pattern in Glosa and would make 
things even more regular. As it is, placed in front of the head verb means 
that we have got well into the sentence before we learn that the S "an" is in 
fact the O and have to sort things out afresh - rather confusing.
