1a works for me. On second thought, how about a slight change... "Fe pa ki
a propria domi." The other translations seem to lose the idea that it is
her own home to which she is going, and that's what the English says to me.
Alternatives: NOSTO = return home -> "Fe pa nosto." EKO = dwell ->
"Fe pa ki a propria eko-do."

2g - I never did like that mysterious "it", so "id" is out. We're
measuring something here, and the something is temperature (and, well,
I'm assuming temperature of the air!) so here goes... "U temperatura
metri hepta-ze grada." Aside: There is no word for temperature in G1000
or G6000. Shall we add your Latin selection?

3h. Or perhaps 3k... "U kumu pa mega." Is "is" really needed here?

4m with a slight modification: "An pa bate se." I'm still kind of torn
between AUTO and SE, but the latter feels more reflexive to me. And we
need to distinguish between doing something *by* oneself and doing
something *to* oneself; that's why I removed the hyphen. The compound
version says to me that he himself did the hitting - but what did he hit?

Tricky one, this. Complicated by that E connecting a couple of sentences
that could almost have stood alone. If two separate sentences, I'd surely
use PA in both. I'll pick 5p. The two components just aren't coupled
tightly enough for me, for the tense of the one to flow into the other.

6u (though I'd be tempted to use 6v for literary purposes). I almost feel
like I'm contradicting myself now, after what I wrote about #5, but here
I see three actions, and the first two are bound together timewise (the
comma does that for me) so I see the third following right after those
two - so we only need the one PA.

7y, with maybe the ES removed? After reading Robin's comments on "is",
I've been thinking about this and suspect that there's another case to
add to his four, and that's the one where we use "is" or some other when
*none* is really needed. This seems to be common in natlangs, for common
verbs like "is" and "have" to spawn idioms.

Bill, 
	I am a bit worried.  I sent my "Hedo Neo Anua" message to the Glosalist,
but your reply came to me - addresses to my email address - with no
reference to "glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au".

	To which address did you send the post: Glosalist, or me, personally? 

	I wonder, if you send a post to the Glosalist, and a subscriber answers
it, will his reply go back out to all Glosalist subscribers, or will his
reply just go to you, as the originator of the message?

	It looks as if a 'switch' has been omitted, something like:-

Reply Address: glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

	I will have to look into this.  So .. would Glosalist subscribers, until
further notice (when I have turned on the 'switch'), please use "Redirect"
or type in  glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au  when "Reply"ing to a Glosalist posting.

*	Interesting: Glosa is quite open-plan, but will it work, at the initial
disemination stage, with such optionality built in?  I had thought that 
	~a fe domi~  meant "to her house", but without context, we can't exactly
identify the ~fe~: it usually relates to the first female, but could refer
to a second female person.
	I feel that 'intent' and 'emphasis' are relevant when we select either 
~domi~ or ~eko-do~.  ~Domi~ is the more normal concept of ''house/home'',
while ~eko~ has a more ''geographical'' feel to it - as I see the two
concepts as distinct ideas.

	~U kumu pa mega.~ feels like "The heap bigged." (grew itself bigger)
	Although words can within reason function as any part of speech, ~mega~
is more like one of the 'function words'.  As a 'modifier' I see it more as
modifying things than actions.  In English, I see "big" as the result of
elision in sentences like "He is big", omitting the "a" and "man".

    If a clause has a third-person singular subject and then in the
predicate there is a third-person singular pronoun or pronominal
adjective with the same sexual referent, there can be ambiguity, as in
English.  Various languages, including at least some of the Romance
languages following Latin, resolve this with reflexive pronouns.  A
reflexive pronoun refers to the subject of the clause in which it
appears in the predicate.  If the third-person predicate reference is 
not via a reflexive, then it referes to other than the subject.

    In the instance cited, the use of _fe_ could be ambiguous even in a
complete clause.  I suggest that Glosa could resolve the ambiguity by
using _se_ or _auto_ as a reflexive in the predicate to refer to the
subject of the clause.  Otherwise, _fe_, _an_, _id_ would refer to
other than the subject.

I agree with the suggestion.  Russian also has a reflexive pronoun 
(s'eb'a) for all persons, and it is extremely useful in such situations 
as this.

Yikes! You're right! Shades of the Esperanto in/transitivity problem - one
of the (few) things I dislike about that language. You've got a transitive
infix "-ig-" and an intransitive infix "-igx-", yet for every verb you must
know (if both are possible) which sort it is, and then use the infix for the
other case. A classic example is "boli - intransitive, to boil", with the
transitive form being "boligi". One solution might be that an infix would
always be used for ambiguous verbs, and that's what I often do - I'd use
"boligxi" and "boligi".

A problem even with that approach is that you still have to agree on which
verbs are ambiguous. I suspect that people will agree in most cases on the
in/transitivity of a given verb - but I also suspect that there are verbs
on which people would not agree. Sometimes, perhaps, ambiguity is in the
eye of the beholder.

So we could say, ok, we *always* use the appropriate infix to indicate
in/transitivity. That could work. Though it might make the language big
and repetitious and probably ugly if you solved all your problems that way!

I see a similar problem here. Is this a cultural thing? Are there languages
that only use *different* words for something that we would call transitive
and intransitive forms? Although we use the word "boil" in both cases, I
think that "boiling something" is quite unlike "being boiled". In a way it's
kind of elegant, using a grammatical form to reduce the dictionary size, but
it also brings up these questions. Does English use Active & Passive because
we're looking at the *same* process from opposite directions? Do *I* have
trouble with this because I'm concentrating on the *opposite directions*
rather than the process? Is this a problem in Glosa...

   (The patient says "Doc, it hurts when I do this."
   and the doctor replies "Then stop doing that!".)

   (In this case I think we've talked me into choosing f. also.)

...or am I just using "METRI" incorrectly? We need might some kind of
marker to resolve situations like this.

Ja, that's the sort of thing I was thinking about. (Until we reach your left
parenthesis.) We've got the idea of a pile, and of the past, and of bigness,
all thrown together. But not of growing. Consider: "U kumu pa ma mega" or
"U kumu pa kresce ma mega".

I just try to avoid such constructions by rewriting or using proper nouns.
Why do even have pronouns? For brevity, I think.

I've always thought it strange that we have a mechanism for reflexivity
rather than for nonreflexivity. For example, if I heard "She went to her
house after school." I'd assume that "She" and "her" refer to the same
person. Even if I knew that there was more than one female involved. If
I heard "Becky went to her house after school." I'd still assume Becky=her.
That's just the simplest way of interpreting the statement.

The question arises with a statement like "She went to Becky's house after
school.". "She" might still be "Becky", but it's unusual in English to
use a pronoun and a name in this way, so that's a sign to me that "She"
is not going to her own house.

"boligxi" and "boligi".

A problem even with that approach is that you still have to agree on which
verbs are ambiguous. I suspect that people will agree in most cases on the
in/transitivity of a given verb - but I also suspect that there are verbs
on which people would not agree. Sometimes, perhaps, ambiguity is in the
eye of the beholder.

So we could say, ok, we *always* use the appropriate infix to indicate
in/transitivity. That could work. Though it might make the language big
and repetitious and probably ugly if you solved all your problems that way!

I see a similar problem here. Is this a cultural thing? Are there languages
that only use *different* words for something that we would call transitive
and intransitive forms? Although we use the word "boil" in both cases, I
think that "boiling something" is quite unlike "being boiled". In a way it's
kind of elegant, using a grammatical form to reduce the dictionary size, but
it also brings up these questions. Does English use Active & Passive because
we're looking at the *same* process from opposite directions? Do *I* have
trouble with this because I'm concentrating on the *opposite directions*
rather than the process? Is this a problem in Glosa...

   (The patient says "Doc, it hurts when I do this."
   and the doctor replies "Then stop doing that!".)

   (In this case I think we've talked me into choosing f. also.)

...or am I just using "METRI" incorrectly? We need might some kind of
marker to resolve situations like this.

Ja, that's the sort of thing I was thinking about. (Until we reach your left
parenthesis.) We've got the idea of a pile, and of the past, and of bigness,
all thrown together. But not of growing. Consider: "U kumu pa ma mega" or
"U kumu pa kresce ma mega".

*	Bill,
What I'll do is send you the Majordomo Manual, which was all that was
posted to me by my ISP.

	I have had a go at interpreting it, and have sent a message to the
majordomo email address, which, if I understand it correctly, acts in
automatic mode if you address it using the right syntax.

	As well as sending the manual, I will append the message that I sent to
Majordomo.  It is quite amazing: I think I have got the same problem that I
had before .. "Replies" going only to the Glosalist subscriber who
originated the posting!  I simply want ALL-TO-ALL communication!!!  Maybe
my attempt at communication with the software did the trick; this is the
first time that I have consciously tried to communicate with a machine,
hoping for an interactive response.

	I sent a follow-up blip to my ISP telling him what I wanted to achieve,
and what I had done in attempting to gain the desired result: also, I sent
a "Cc:" of this blip to Paul Bartlett.   That makes two "Attachments" to
this blip.  By the way, did I tell you that I am now using Eudora Ver 3.0,
and will register it ... all to avoid being 'timed out' again.

*	Bill,
	Thank you for the immediate response to the Skribble idea.  Maybe the
Glosa version should have a more appropriate name, such as, "Skribe-La."
I thought of replying in Glosa, but the concepts involved would make this a
bit slow.

	I send the English language version of the rules; these can of course be
altered, and the translation of them into Glosa would make a nice exercise
for the Glosalist group - once a set that is suitable for a Glosa,
email-run version of the game is decided upon.  A number of things are
needed before play commences:-
A.	Rules in English, Glosa, and as many other languages as we like ...
B.	Sets of phrases, including single words and some clauses
C.	An agreed operating method for the game; i.e. sequencing, ettiquette,
means of accepting sentences, selection of phrases to be sent to players, ...
D.	Paper or electronic display of the game in play - ?

	Once the overall operation of the game is sorted out, we can introduce the
concept to Glosalist subscribers.  
	
A. As mentioned, this could be a learning experience in two ways: firstly
for Glosa-pe in translating the rules into the language of their choice;
and secondly, it would be an 'in' into Glosa for people outside the
English-language sphere (who, as Paul Bartlett has said, we are ignoring).

B. It could be a very instructive phase of the operation, just getting
people to make up sentences, and cut them up into playable bits, e.g.

	U fo alti andra pa celero greso trans u lati, risko via.

	u fo alti andra
	pa celero greso
	trans u lati, risko via

	[There probably would need to be a length limit on phrases.]

C. Making it work in practice, would probably involve a number of trial runs.
I suspect that Paul Bartlett, who uses a UNIX connection could not use an
interactive, screen-based version of the game.  I have found that my
'formatting' in email does not always get through as I had intended it.  My
only solution for Eudora was to fill the white space with dots, e.g.

*****************************************************************************
****************************** u fo alti andra ******************************
****************************** ............... ******************************
************* tri melano felis pa celero greso epi u kloro . seqe u pusi . **
************* ................ ............... ..... gramini ....... muska **
****************************** trans u lati, . ************* . pa vora.... **
****************************** ..... risko via ************* ............. **
************************************************************ plu hepta-ze  **
************************************************************ ... rubi bola **
************************************************************ plu penta ... **
************************************************************ .. riso ju-fe **
************************************************************ . pa nekto .. **
************************************************************ ............. **
************************************************************ in u mega ... **
************************************************************ .......boteka **
*****************************************************************************

	Doing this took a while.  Possibly it can be run as a separate program
with full scrolling, so that players' contributions can be fit in to an
existing layout, which is offline.  From my experience with HTML code, I
found the only thing that allowed my own formatting was the  <PRE>  tag.
But I would like to hear how you would fit /.. an ...../  /.. pa kurso ../
/ dia u parka/  / e pa vide ../ in front of  "plu penta riso ju-fe".

	Of course, the next player could use an  /... and .../ between "trans u
lati, risko via" and "dia u parka" to score five points.

D. And then there is th physical way of seeing the game.  We really did
have a sentence that stretched across the lounge-room floor - in an English
language version of the game, of course.  Without scrolling,
Skribble/Skribe-La will not work on the computer screen.  How have you
imagined the game being set out and played?

and the unexpected, is just what a jaded world needs to give it a laugh as

with Glosa if the Esperanto instructions were replaced with Glosa ones;
this would require some reverse engineering.  I have thought of trying the
same with English-language text adventure games.

In the config file, I think we need...

        # reply_to             [word] () <resend,digest>
        # Put a reply-to header with value <value> into the outgoing
        # message. If the token $SENDER is used, then the address of the
        # sender is used as the value of the reply-to header. This is the
        # value of the reply-to header for digest lists.
reply_to            = glosalist{at}zeta{dot}org{dot}au

...which forces the reply back to the list. While searching for more
information on the Net, I found that some prefer lists to be set up
the way we have it now. Perhaps that's why it's the default. I think
it's an old Unix prejudice; many Unix mailers have separate commands
for reply-to-sender and reply-to-group. And there are many classic
stories of embarassment caused when somebody used the wrong command!
But I'd argue that on a list, the whole idea is to treat the group as
the sender upon reply! So let's give it a whirl!

Hopefully we can get this nailed down today. I'll login periodically
today to check for place-responde messages!

I'd like to use email attachments or ftp. Definitely ftp eventually, if not
sooner, like now! Yes, the program or zipfile would require binary transfer.
Some ftp programs require the user to select the transfer mode; some detect
it automatically (although they often seem to guess wrong!); browsers
usually seem to handle things properly.

If ftp is ok for you, I'll put those files on my site today! pkzipped?

But also see my comments below concerning permission...

Currently, the programs use plain old ASCII textfiles for their input, and
these could be used just like Paul's reference. For distribution without
permission I'll need to encrypt datafiles and/or embed the data inside the
program.

1) Do you have PKZIP?

2) Do you have Windows 3.1, 3.11 or 95?
   (The Windows version should work on any of these.)

3) Do you have VBRUN100.DLL in \WINDOWS or \WINDOWS\SYSTEM?
   (Either directory should work.)

Ja, that's the *only* way to to tell Browsers to keep their hands off.
For anything outside a Preformatted Text block, browsers collapse whitespace
and insert newlines wherever necessary. According to the HTML specs, browsers
are free to interpret HTML in any (reasonable) way that they wish, so you
can't really get too fancy if you want portability. There's no way to really
know how the page will appear for all browsers. For example, the <H1>
through <H6> tags for Headers. The only requirement is that <H1> be more
distinctive than <H2>, <H2> than <H3>, etc. Excellent for portability, but
if you're picky about the way your page looks, you're going to have trouble.
Most browsers use a large font for <H1>, a smaller font for <H2>, etc., but
they can use different fonts, or colors, or shades of gray, or italics.

Last weekend I stumbled upon an Adventure site that had links to others,
and just as I can get lost in a library or a bookstore and now on the Net,
I ended up spending hours over the past week exploring the current state
of Adventure Games - or "Interactive Fiction" as it now seems to be called,
though it'll always be Adventure Games to me; and IF also includes some
graphical games too so it's not necessarily exclusively Text Adventure.

See http://www.neosplice.com/~ailanto/xyzzy.htm for some of my findings.

There's a lot of source code out there, public domain. For example, the
original Adventure exists in many different forms and languages. Perhaps
we could add Glosa. Also of interest is that there's some good free
development software out there - I've been investigating INFORM and HUGO -
and these seem quite suitable for what we have in mind. These development
tools even come with source code, so we can really dig into them if there's
any translation problems, though they appear to be sufficiently configurable
to handle such things anyway.

*	Somehow, I feel that in Glosa less is better.

	Where it seems necessary to specify exactly who is diong what, Glosa
allows this:-

	Fe pa bate u pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate u pedi.
	Fe pa bate-se epi u pedi.
	Fe pa bate fe pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate fe pedi.
	Fe auto pa bate-se epi fe pedi.  [Possibly a little redundant]
	U gina pa bate u pedi.
	U gina pa bate-se epi fe pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe pedi.
	U gina auto pa bate fe pedi.
	U gina auto pa bate-se epi fe pedi.  [Over-redundant again?]
	Fe pa bate fe auto pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe auto pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe epi fe pedi.
	U gina pa bate fe epi fe auto pedi.

So, take your pick.  Some of the above are ambiguous, while some are
redundant.
But, in context, you will probably know who is hitting whom.

	I will put in Bill Patterson's comment about it being better to avoid
undue reflexivity if meaning does not call for it.

BP>
I've always thought it strange that we have a mechanism for reflexivity
rather than for nonreflexivity. For example, if I heard "She went to her
house after school." I'd assume that "She" and "her" refer to the same
person. Even if I knew that there was more than one female involved. If
I heard "Becky went to her house after school." I'd still assume Becky=her.***
That's just the simplest way of interpreting the statement.

The question arises with a statement like "She went to Becky's house after###
school.". "She" might still be "Becky", but it's unusual in English to
use a pronoun and a name in this way, so that's a sign to me that "She"
is not going to her own house.
END<
*	I would agrre with Bill, that English works in the ways marked *** and
###, and I feel that there is no reason that Glosa should not act in this
way, also.

Saluta,
 Robin

*	I'd rather not invent a marker for either active or passive in Glosa.  
The authors are firmly in favour of everything being in the Active Voice;
and, the Passive form   ~gene ge-X~  = "got Xed"  is relatively new in Glosa.

But transitivity is different, and some concepts do allow both usages,
while many actions either act on something or they don't.  In Glosa, it is
supposed that a combination of syntax and context will sort out whether we
will have a direct object or not.  EG  Id pa pluvi.
		Q. Qe, id pa pluvi qod?  R. Asura, id pa pluvi hidra!

** METRI
As a substantive, this word can function as thing, action or modifier.  So,
somewhere, possibly in our brains, there is a 'centre of measuringness':
one exploration of semantics involves the attempt to use a word in as many
different functional ways as possible; in how many ways can we express the
concept of "measuring" using this word?  After trying ten, or so, ways, we
will probably reach the logical limit of the lexical item ~metri~.

*	Id say that one of the unwritten rules of Linguistics is involved here.
In the same way that if you wear a suit, you can always 'dress down' by
taking off your jacket, and even your tie, thus, with communication you can
use all of the function words to ensure full understanding, or you can
'elide' and drop out the words that you think are unnecessary.

	No-one will complain that your mode of speech is a little verbose, if
they understand well everything you say; however, people will complain, or
worse, stop listening, if the brevity of your utterance causes them pain in
the process of trying to understand what you are saying.

	In ~U kumupa pa ma mega.~ something definitely seems to be missing, and
one can put the short sentence through the brain a number of times in
trying to find the sense in it, running through different possible actions
in attempting to relate the heap to its size: this hunting for meaning can
cause actual pain.

[[[[[ Until I sort out the "Respond_to:"  switch for the Glosalist, I would
suggest that subscribers use "Forward" rather than "Reply" when answering a
post, otherwise only the originator of the post will read your reply.

This is a _Test 3 Reply_ and from the

Nick tweaked the  glosalist  config file.

	Thank you Nick.

*	Thank you again, Nick.  I suppose after numenous Trials and errors, I
would have twigged to using the  " = "  sign and combining this with the
List's email address, then again I might have taken a long while to arrive
at it.

	Even if they are altruists, I think they might have given one or two
examples of what to do to alter a few key items of configuration.  And, yes
the "spokes of a wheel" pattern has been the acknowleged best communication
model for a few decades, now.

	Great News that you were able to adjust the file without much trouble.

Much Appreciated,
 Robin
