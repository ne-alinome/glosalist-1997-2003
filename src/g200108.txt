NBCi, which took over Xoom some time back, has decided not to provide
webspace anymore. Of course, they didn't bother to inform their members;
I just had so much trouble, even more than usual, uploading the latest
files, that I decided to browse around their pages to see if I could
find out why I had been getting the message "Try again in an hour"
for the last 24 hours. Finally clicking on the link advertising their
website services to prospective members, I learned that they *don't*
provide website services anymore, as of a couple of weeks ago. And that
uploads are now prohibited, so what's there is all that will ever be
there, until they wipe the directories... and I can't even put up a
redirect page!

Oh well, I guess I saw this coming. Xoom/NBCi has been pretty flaky for
a long time (if I had used them regularly I would have dropped them a
long time ago, but the only thing I had there was the glosalist archives
and I only update those once a month), and I'd read rumors a few months
ago that they were considering such a move, and that's why I created
a mirror of the archives back then. Now the mirror will become *the*
archive site. (The old site still exists, but can't be updated, and will
disappear.)

The new link for the archive is:

   http://www.kafejo.com/lingvoj/auxlangs/glosa/archives

By the way, the Exercise program is here now (the old page points to
this one):

Io pensa, que on usa -a in "na", nam isto es radice Indo-Europee (r. nas,
nash, esp. nosotros. fr nous(?)), e si on usava "o", e post elemination de
"s" nos haberea le parola "no".

Esperanto "kaf-ej-o" = Glosa "kafa-lo" (usually "cafe" or
"coffeehouse" or "coffeeshop", but generally speaking could
be any place that has something to do with coffee, according
to context I suppose.)

    (Sorry that this is not in Glosa)

    May I make a suggestion?  Please do not send a post as nothing but
attachments rather than as part of the message itself.  For some mail
agents, this becomes a bother.  Also, if a post is sent as both plain
text and HTML, it is needlessly sent twice, taking up resources.  It
risks causing some people to incur extra expense if they have to pay
by quantity.  Plain text will do just fine.

    Thanks very much.

My rule of thumb would be to generally avoid emailing "large" amounts of text
to a list like this.
For me, "large" might be more than 100 lines, or more than a 1000 words (?). I
can imagine 
occasional exceptions, of course.

Beyond that size, I generally put the material up on a web page, and just email
a link to it.
Of course, the pain threshold will be different for different people.

Kevin

    It is not only a matter of length.  It is *how* the message is
sent.  Because a sender has no control over what sort of mail agents
other people have, and because dfferent mail agents have different
capabilities, the very safest method is simply to send a message as
plain text -- no attachments, no HTML, no pictures, etc.  That way just
about everyone can read it.  Even if people have HTML-enabled mail
agents, sending a message as both plain text and as HTML is wasteful,
because the message in effect is sent twice, consuming resources
needlessly.  If you have something in a special format, it is best to
post a notice and send it to those who request it or to put it on an
ftp or www site and post the URL.

I find learning languages very difficult but since I took up Glosa, I have 
read with considerable pleasure things in Glosa, from people of Germany, 
Russia, China, Greece, Africa  etc apart from English speakers. All quite 
easy. I have looked at one or two other artificial languages but much prefer 
G. There are one or two small things I should like to see changed. On the 
whole, I think that if G could get itself more widely known, with a larger 
body of works and a little more streamlined, it would compare favourably with 
any of the others.

    Incidentally, sid, your posts are coming across, at least to my mail
server, as nothing but attachments in two forms (text and HTML), which
make them harder to read, at least for me.  (Perhaps others do not have
the same difficulty.)

    There is always the issue of "reformitis."  One person's necessary
feature is another person's fatal flaw.  For those who have not read
it, I will blow my own horn and refer to my essay, "Thoughts on IAL
Success" at http://www.smart.net/~bartlett/thoughts.html
One of the points I make is the necessity for a stable base if any IAL
is to go anywhere.  Of tinkering there is no end.  I can see, after
some time of trial use, perhaps one major reform, as with Ido and
Esperanto -- or with Interglossa and Glosa (and I am sorry that
Interglossa never got a real trial; I just acquired a copy) -- but
otherwise eventually the tinkering has to stop.

New to Glosa.  
For an auxilliary language to really work shouldn't the vocabulary be 
streamlined?
6000 seems like too much.


   I thought I would lurk a bit to see if anything was going on in


Glosa-land.  I wasn't sure whether I was having trouble with my email,
so I sent a test message.  According to "Glosa 6000," 'proba' means
"test, trial."  Lack of consistent vocabulary lists has always been a
problem for would-be Glosa-pe and others.

    Recently I acquired a copy of "Interglossa," and I realize how 
much A&C "pulled" the language in the direction of merely almost a
relexified English, in which case just teach people real English.  (I
see this especially in the use of Glosa by native anglophones.)  I am
beginning to think that Hogben had a better idea all along.  It's too
bad that Interglossa never got a serious trial.

I'm not a linguist. Can you elaborate on your statement? I'm fairly
familiar with Glosa, but not with interglossa, so if you can frame it in
terms of English and Glosa it would be most helpful.

    This has been a matter of some disagreement among proponents of
Glosa.  Hogben's original Interglossa had a vocabulary of approximately
880 words (I would have to refresh the exact number) which were
operated, so to speak, in a manner rather different from current Glosa. 
Originally there were lists of "Glosa 1000" by which it was claimed
that, apart for specific names of specific things (such as local flora
and fauna), one could say whatever needed to be said.  (My
characterization.)  Unfortunately, there were various lists of "Glosa
1000" which were not entirely consistent among themselves.  However,
there are those who think that a vocabulary of 1000 is too limiting. 
Clark and Ashby did publish a list of "Glosa 6000," and in recent times
there has been some discussion about an appropriate size for the Glosa
vocabulary.

    Please give me a chance to try to put something together.  This
evening I am trying to catch up on email with some quick replies to
various groups.

I'm not a linguist either and don't pretend to understand a lot of what you 
said, but it sounds to me that Interglosa is a superior conlang. Why doesn't 
someone revive it?

<BR>&gt; I'm not a linguist. Can you elaborate on your statement? I'm fairly
<BR>&gt; familiar with Glosa, but not with interglossa, so if you can frame it in
<BR>&gt; terms of English and Glosa it would be most helpful.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A relexification of a language is simply a one-for-one substitution of
<BR>vocabulary items while keeping the overall structure of the language the
<BR>same. &nbsp;In this regard, Glosa is not strictly a relexification of English,
<BR>although it comes close.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance, English has kept a few residual inflections, whereas
<BR>Glosa has none, the relationships shown by Indo-European inflections
<BR>being shown in Glosa by particles. &nbsp;However, some Glosa-pe whose native
<BR>language is English seem to be unable to break themselves of their
<BR>native English habits, so that allowing for simple particles to
<BR>substitute one-for-one for residual inflections, their Glosa comes close
<BR>to a relexification of English.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the Indo-European languages, for the most part, including
<BR>English, nouns are always marked for number. (There are minor
<BR>exceptions, such as "sheep" in English, but even then number tends to be
<BR>marked in other ways, if nothing else by context.) &nbsp;There is no inherent
<BR>logical necessity for this, and some languages allow nouns *not* to be
<BR>singular, dual, plural, or whatever. &nbsp;But some Glosa-pe persist in
<BR>marking nouns for number whether they need to be or not.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is one shortcoming which Glosa did inherit from Interglossa,
<BR>in that in both the particles 'u(n)' and 'plu' mark nouns (and do not
<BR>serve as "a(n)" or "the," despite the confusing statements in some of
<BR>the Glosa literature) when nothing else makes it clear that words are
<BR>nouns, but unfortunately the IG/Gl particles *do* mark for number. &nbsp;This
<BR>is unnecessary. &nbsp;Sometimes number is unknown or simply irrelevant, so
<BR>why mark it? &nbsp;Learners of Glosa whose native tongues do not insist on
<BR>number marking may think the habits of anglophone Glosa-pe simply to be
<BR>strange, and if the anglophones cannot break themselves of their native
<BR>habit, they might conceivably have trouble understanding the usages of
<BR>others.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another such habit is verb marking. &nbsp;Indo-European languages mark
<BR>verbs for tense and/or aspect, but there is no reason Writ Large In
<BR>The Nature Of The Cosmos why verbs have to be marked at all in some
<BR>situations. &nbsp;Some languages do *not* always mark verbs for tense or
<BR>aspect. &nbsp;Sometimes the temporal or aspectual characteristic is merely
<BR>irrelevant. &nbsp;If so, why persist in marking it? &nbsp;If a time reference is
<BR>clearly in the past, for example, it is simply redundant to keep marking
<BR>verbs with 'pa', 'pa', 'pa', 'pa'.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that there is only one consideration for excess markers: a
<BR>noisy channel for speech. &nbsp;This does not apply to writing, and even in
<BR>speech I consider it a bit of a stretch, because if the channel is that
<BR>noisy, probably a lot else of the speech stream will be garbled anyway.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This business of over marking of nouns and verbs in Glosa is a hobby
<BR>horse of mine which others already know about, so I had best climb down
<BR>from it.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lancelot Hogben published Interglossa in the dark days of World War
<BR>II, which probably had a lot with why it did not get much of a trial.
<BR>It had some significant features which Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby changed
<BR>in creating Glosa.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, Hogben knowingly and deliberately eschewed strict
<BR>phonemicity of spelling in order to keep better recognizability of
<BR>roots. &nbsp;C&amp;A changed (some would say mutilated) many roots in order to
<BR>have strictly phonemic spelling. &nbsp;There were some roots in Glosa which
<BR>I simply did not recognize as first because of the way C&amp;A had changed
<BR>them.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Glosa does use some different words for the particles, such as 'id'
<BR>for IG's 're', 'pa' for 'pre', and the like.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, the greatest difference, as I see it, between the two
<BR>languages is the overall structure. &nbsp;As I mentioned, if you allow for
<BR>the substitution of particles for residual inflection, Glosa is nearly
<BR>relexified English. &nbsp;Interglossa is not. &nbsp;This is what I meant by Clark
<BR>and Ashby "pulling" in the direction of English.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although there are a few tense, modal, aspectual, and other
<BR>auxiliaries, IG has only twenty (if I recall the number correctly)
<BR>real verbs, whereas the number of verbs is more or less open ended in
<BR>Glosa. &nbsp;IG builds verbal structures from one of the twenty verbs
<BR>(which Hogben tends to call verboids for a reason I have not yet figured
<BR>out -- the style of the book "Interglossa" is not as transparent as it
<BR>might have been), allowing for the use of auxiliaries if strictly
<BR>needed. &nbsp;To one of these verbs is usually added a word H calls an
<BR>"amplifier," so that the actual verbal structure is usually composite.
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These verbal structures need to be distinguished from English
<BR>phrasal verbs, which should be scrupulously avoided in an auxiliary
<BR>language. &nbsp;(I once read a remark by a European with near native fluency
<BR>in English that he had more trouble mastering English's phrasal verbs
<BR>than he did the bizarre spelling.) &nbsp;An English phrasal verb at times is
<BR>nearly a lexical atom, not entirely lexically decomposable into its
<BR>constituents. &nbsp;(This is why Basic English is basically fraudulent.)
<BR>IG's verbal structures, however, *are* decomposable. &nbsp;For instance, the
<BR>IG skeleton 'P mote Q ex R as S' conveys "P shifts Q from R to S" or 'P
<BR>mote Q apo R' as "P removes Q from R, P takes Q from R.' &nbsp;As such,
<BR>'mote' stands for induced motion without specific reference to its
<BR>direction. &nbsp;Thus, one could construct the tables:
<BR>
<BR>P mote Q latero R &nbsp;P puts Q beside R
<BR>P mote Q epi R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P puts Q on R
<BR>P mote Q laevo R &nbsp;&nbsp;P puts Q to the left of R
<BR>P mote Q peri R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P puts Q round R
<BR>P mote Q supero R &nbsp;P puts Q above R
<BR>P mote Q hypo R &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P puts Q under R
<BR>
<BR>P mote Q supero &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P raises Q
<BR>P mote Q hypo &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P lowers Q
<BR>P mote Q extra &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;P ejects Q

<BR>P mote Q in terra &nbsp;P buries Q
<BR>P mote Q in liquo &nbsp;P immerses Q
<BR>-- and so on --
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that it is the verbal structure which most distinguishes
<BR>Glosa and Interglossa. &nbsp;Also, IG has a limited vocabulary, and the
<BR>verbal structure is significant in this. &nbsp;The base vocabulary has only

<BR>closed vocabulary. &nbsp;(Its vocabulary lists are not even consistent, but
<BR>that is an editing problem.)
<BR>
<BR> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other differences, but I myself think that these are the
<BR>most significant.

    A relexification of a language is simply a one-for-one substitution of
vocabulary items while keeping the overall structure of the language the
same.  In this regard, Glosa is not strictly a relexification of English,
although it comes close.

    For instance, English has kept a few residual inflections, whereas
Glosa has none, the relationships shown by Indo-European inflections
being shown in Glosa by particles.  However, some Glosa-pe whose native
language is English seem to be unable to break themselves of their
native English habits, so that allowing for simple particles to
substitute one-for-one for residual inflections, their Glosa comes close
to a relexification of English.

    In the Indo-European languages, for the most part, including
English, nouns are always marked for number. (There are minor
exceptions, such as "sheep" in English, but even then number tends to be
marked in other ways, if nothing else by context.)  There is no inherent
logical necessity for this, and some languages allow nouns *not* to be
singular, dual, plural, or whatever.  But some Glosa-pe persist in
marking nouns for number whether they need to be or not.

    This is one shortcoming which Glosa did inherit from Interglossa,
in that in both the particles 'u(n)' and 'plu' mark nouns (and do not
serve as "a(n)" or "the," despite the confusing statements in some of
the Glosa literature) when nothing else makes it clear that words are
nouns, but unfortunately the IG/Gl particles *do* mark for number.  This
is unnecessary.  Sometimes number is unknown or simply irrelevant, so
why mark it?  Learners of Glosa whose native tongues do not insist on
number marking may think the habits of anglophone Glosa-pe simply to be
strange, and if the anglophones cannot break themselves of their native
habit, they might conceivably have trouble understanding the usages of
others.

    Another such habit is verb marking.  Indo-European languages mark
verbs for tense and/or aspect, but there is no reason Writ Large In
The Nature Of The Cosmos why verbs have to be marked at all in some
situations.  Some languages do *not* always mark verbs for tense or
aspect.  Sometimes the temporal or aspectual characteristic is merely
irrelevant.  If so, why persist in marking it?  If a time reference is
clearly in the past, for example, it is simply redundant to keep marking
verbs with 'pa', 'pa', 'pa', 'pa'.

    I think that there is only one consideration for excess markers: a
noisy channel for speech.  This does not apply to writing, and even in
speech I consider it a bit of a stretch, because if the channel is that
noisy, probably a lot else of the speech stream will be garbled anyway.

    This business of over marking of nouns and verbs in Glosa is a hobby
horse of mine which others already know about, so I had best climb down
from it.

    Lancelot Hogben published Interglossa in the dark days of World War
II, which probably had a lot with why it did not get much of a trial.
It had some significant features which Ron Clark and Wendy Ashby changed
in creating Glosa.

    For example, Hogben knowingly and deliberately eschewed strict
phonemicity of spelling in order to keep better recognizability of
roots.  C&A changed (some would say mutilated) many roots in order to
have strictly phonemic spelling.  There were some roots in Glosa which
I simply did not recognize as first because of the way C&A had changed
them.

    Glosa does use some different words for the particles, such as 'id'
for IG's 're', 'pa' for 'pre', and the like.

    However, the greatest difference, as I see it, between the two
languages is the overall structure.  As I mentioned, if you allow for
the substitution of particles for residual inflection, Glosa is nearly
relexified English.  Interglossa is not.  This is what I meant by Clark
and Ashby "pulling" in the direction of English.

    Although there are a few tense, modal, aspectual, and other
auxiliaries, IG has only twenty (if I recall the number correctly)
real verbs, whereas the number of verbs is more or less open ended in
Glosa.  IG builds verbal structures from one of the twenty verbs
(which Hogben tends to call verboids for a reason I have not yet figured
out -- the style of the book "Interglossa" is not as transparent as it
might have been), allowing for the use of auxiliaries if strictly
needed.  To one of these verbs is usually added a word H calls an
"amplifier," so that the actual verbal structure is usually composite.

    These verbal structures need to be distinguished from English
phrasal verbs, which should be scrupulously avoided in an auxiliary
language.  (I once read a remark by a European with near native fluency
in English that he had more trouble mastering English's phrasal verbs
than he did the bizarre spelling.)  An English phrasal verb at times is
nearly a lexical atom, not entirely lexically decomposable into its
constituents.  (This is why Basic English is basically fraudulent.)
IG's verbal structures, however, *are* decomposable.  For instance, the
IG skeleton 'P mote Q ex R as S' conveys "P shifts Q from R to S" or 'P
mote Q apo R' as "P removes Q from R, P takes Q from R.'  As such,
'mote' stands for induced motion without specific reference to its
direction.  Thus, one could construct the tables:

P mote Q latero R  P puts Q beside R
P mote Q epi R     P puts Q on R
P mote Q laevo R   P puts Q to the left of R
P mote Q peri R    P puts Q round R
P mote Q supero R  P puts Q above R
P mote Q hypo R    P puts Q under R

P mote Q supero    P raises Q
P mote Q hypo      P lowers Q
P mote Q extra     P ejects Q
P mote Q in        P inserts Q (in)
P mote Q peri R    P winds Q around R
P mote Q in terra  P buries Q
P mote Q in liquo  P immerses Q
-- and so on --

    I think that it is the verbal structure which most distinguishes
Glosa and Interglossa.  Also, IG has a limited vocabulary, and the
verbal structure is significant in this.  The base vocabulary has only
880 words, although in everyday speech, to avoid defining rather than
naming it might be advisable to have additional words for everyday
things.  (For instance how would one speak of a raccoon or opossum?  The
common approach is to use the biological nomenclature name, at least the
genus thereof.)  On the other hand, Glosa does not have at present a
closed vocabulary.  (Its vocabulary lists are not even consistent, but
that is an editing problem.)

    There are other differences, but I myself think that these are the
most significant.

resources, causing each message to be at least twice as long; plain
text is preferable;  2) please do not quote an entire long post merely

again, quoting the entire thing wastes resources);  3) please do not
send your entire message as nothing but attachments: some people's mail
agents have a problem with such messages.  Please learn how to use your

    Thank you.  (And just in case anyone is wondering, apart from the

    One important thing to remember (or realize) when it comes to
constructed international auxiliary languages is that one man's
necessary feature is another man's fatal flaw.  For instance, I myself
think that Ido is superior to Esperanto, but I know one Esperantist who
is of just the opposite opinion.  I am tending to like Interglossa over
Glosa, but others may hold to the contrary.  And so it goes.  In the
end, structural linguistic characteristics will probably not the the
only, or even the most important, factor determining whether any conIAL
gains widespread acceptance.

    More to the point. ;-)  Why doesn't someone try to revive
Interglossa (note the double 'ss')?  One difficulty might be in
descriptive or instructional material.  Copies of the book are
sometimes hard to find, as it was printed on cheap paper in the middle
of a major war.  I don't know how many copies were ever printed.  More
importantly, I once read that Ron Clark bought the copyright to the
book "Interglossa." If so, I have no idea what the copyright status is,
because he died farily recently.  Unfortunately these days, especially
on the internet, there is a tendency to ignore such things as
copyright, a tendency I cannot support.  I do not know enough about
intellectual property law around the world to know if it would be
feasible to provide enough material without infringing the right of
whoever -- if anyone -- owns the copyright now.

    Even apart from copyright, if any proposed conIAL is to go very far
and be anything other than the plaything (not that there is anything
wrong with that, mind you) of a few individuals who already have a
language in common, material needs to be available for learners in more
than just one language (English in this case).  To the best of my
knowledge, information about Ido, Interlingua, Esperanto, Lojban, and
maybe Volapük are available on the world wide web in various languages.

    Finally, I suspect that few people who do not have (or at least
have read) a copy of "Interglossa" (the book itself) really know the
language well enough to try to revive it -- or more accurately, to try
to get it going in the first place, as I doubt that it ever really did
get a good start.  Unfortunately, Hogben's style was not the easiest to
read, at least for me.

    Although I have some interest, I am not now personally in a good
position to speahead such a movement.

I could go either way on this. I guess I'd have to be fluent enough in a
language 
to know when it would be redundant.

Personally, I prefer phonetics, as in Glosa.

I like this. Does it refer only to physical motion, or also to things like
"pulling" 
an answer out of someone?

Sounds good.

Thanks for the clarifications and elaboration.

Perhaps it is a good feature of an auxlang to permit near-direct
translation from the languages of the anticipated audience.
If some tend to add "redundant" articles or tenses, especially in
early stages of learning, why not permit without encouraging it.

But by choosing a strict word order, this limits the audience.
Approx 50% of the world's languages place the verb after what we call
the direct and indirect objects, contrary to English and Glosa.
And 50% of the languages usually put the modifier after the modified
word. So fully 75% of the world will find the word order foreign.

However, by using particles in a consistent way, some of the
strictness of ordering can be relaxed, e.g. by always marking
indirect objects with the "ad" preposition, always marking the
verb with a tense or aspect particle, and using prepositions to
mark the direct object ("em") and "ergative/ablative" subject ("per").

Overall, such marking seems to me very helpful in an auxlang.

> For instance, English has kept a few residual inflections, whereas

Particles are exactly equivalent to inflections, though.
As long as they are relatively few, and consistent, no harm.

Glosa prefers prepositions (including articles and tense markers) to
suffixes/inflections. With a well-designed set of articles/quantifiers,
one should be able to avoid number-marking *and* monotony.

Why not cater to the habits of both? Allow optional marking.
Design the lang so it's easy to get right, difficult to be wrong.

Actually, there is. No language fails to indicate transitive/intransitive
in some way, and all verbs have a notion of aspect indicated by default
(zero-marking) which can be over-ridden by some means. So I think the best
thing to do is to mark consistently but minimally. There are several
different ways to do it. Glosa does better than many pidgins by providing
a (nearly) full set of aspect/tense particles, and only lacks the
accusative marker ("em") for transitivity.

And many different roots fall together by merging C into S/K.
Since all nations pronounce Latin and Greek roots differently
but recognize them visually, the cleverest solution is to
*keep the spelling* and *change the pronunciation*.

If there were a few particles added to differentiate adjectives from
nouns, then a true-to-itself Glosa could also accommodate relexing
from Spanish, French, and Japanese. 100% of the languages of the world
would be easy to relex into Glosa, *and back again*.

I like that idea, but we'd need more like 100 basic verbs, and the ability
to easily create "phrasals". I believe Glosa could support that, as-is.

> An English phrasal verb at times is

Right. Importing them straight into Glosa would be bad.
It is a productive and inevitable process of language,
to build up complex verbs from simpler components.
The alternative of 5000 Romance verbs is not workable.

Yes, that's another major issue. There was an experiment by Jeffrey
Henning to try to reduce roots to a minimum. A base vocab of particles
and verbs and such, minus the world of things and names, could be
kept under 1000. Glosa as an "isolating" type of language should be
able to borrow specific nouns freely, without impacting its structure.

I have tried to encourage people to post in plain ASCII,
but with no success. I can't read the attachments without
annoyance, so I delete them unread. Life's too short.
Those people using AOL should carefully configure their
"preferences" or "options" or whatever AOL calls them,
to NOT post HTML or attachments. This is the standard,
follow it or be ignored! (Which isn't *so* bad ...)

Yes, but everything in human life is the same way. That's why
a majority of 50% (or less in the USA) rules the day.

Glosa needs a revision, for sure. Rather than complain,
though, I'll list *good* points (IMO) to keep:

* no inflections, all grammar is in prepositioned particles

* easy-to-pronounce roots based on Latin and Greek

* does not mimic Romance languages (others do that better anyway)

* attempts to be easy to learn for non-Euros

* is relatively open and unsophisticated and simple

    No, everything is coming through as attachments, and Charles noted
this also.  I presume it is a matter of setting options correctly.  
Because I have never user AOL I don't know how to make these settings,
but if there is no way, then AOL is not worth subscribing to.  I do
know that with Microsoft Outlook, for instance, it is merely a setting
tha needs to be done.  Unfortunately, services such as AOL may not
provide much assistance to new users in the hope that non-AOL
recipients will get irritated enough, cave in, and join them.

*  Hello All,

   Here is a slight variation on on the relexification story:-

   When putting Glosa together, Ron and wendy (C&A) chose to make up a composite language which carried - as well as possible - the 'best' qualities from the various existing languages - national and classical.

   For Grammar, they chose that of English, but with the avoidance of inflections (both different forms of the same word EG 'go; went' and meldings onto words EG 'quick; quickly); also, they promoted a ~fairly strict sequence of word function within phrases (NP: determinant - number - modifier[s] - "noun" ... VP: tense particle - modifier[s] - "verb" - amplifier). As well as all this, they chose to make room for clauses, and after some prompting from other Glosa-pe, the passive form.

   However, to do all this well takes a little practice, and some trial and error.  There is, I believe, a straight version of Glosa, which is somewhat away from Hogben's original pattern; however, I feel it is more in line with the way 'most' humans handle language than was that of Hogben.  Here, I should say that it is too easy for speakers of English to assume that many of their beloved structures from English MUST also be understandable in Glosa.  This is a false belief: with Glosa the syntax is what determines the meaning of a sentence, so word order - according to fairly simple rules as suggested above, and in my website http://www.zeta.org.au/~rgaskell - will, I believe, give the language life. 


   Here I must also say that psychologically I differ from Paul, in that I feel considerably more comfortable with the wider range of more specfic words - or concepts: Paul finds the unnecessary repetition of tense particles irksome; I do not, but agree with him that, once a time-frame has been established, it need not be reinforced with every Verb Phrase.  On the other hand, I find repetition of lexical concepts somewhat off-putting, thus I would rather simply say 

~An pa leva id.~ [(he did raise it) = He raised it.] than ^An pa mote id supra.^ [(he did move it up/over) = He raised it.]

AND  ~An pa leva id; e loka id epi u grada~ [He raised it, and put it on the step.] rather than ^An pa mote id supra; e mote id epi u grada.^ [He raised it, and put it on the step.]

I will agree that the 'phrasal' structure either ~leva ana~ [raise upwards] or ^mote supra^ [move up] are less preferred, yet ... for some meanings can be imagined to be better  ~E nu, leva ana tu braki.~ [(and now raise upwards your arm<<s>) And now, raise up your arms.]

>'mote' stands for induced motion without specific reference to its

*  Interglossa (?)                       ***       Glosa (added by R.G.)


>P mote Q latero R  P puts Q beside R ...........P loka Q alelo R

>P mote Q epi R     P puts Q on R ...............P vesti R ko Q

>P mote Q laevo R   P puts Q to the left of R ...P loka Q laevo de R

>P mote Q peri R    P puts Q round R ............P loka Q peri R

>P mote Q supero R  P puts Q above R ............P loka Q supra R

>P mote Q hypo R    P puts Q under R ........... P loka Q supro R

>P mote Q supero    P raises Q ................. P leva Q

>P mote Q hypo      P lowers Q ................. P loka hipo Q


>P mote Q extra     P ejects Q ................. P loka apo Q

>P mote Q in        P inserts Q (in) ........... P loka intra Q; P in-lo Q

>P mote Q in liquo  P immerses Q ............... P loka Q in-liqi

*   As I understand it, Glosa is supposed to be an 'open' language.

Saluta, karo Glosa-pe!
We have many persons in this group, which prefer English for discussions in
this list, so in the message I'll use only this language. So, I'm not a
native speaker of English and, please, excuse my errors.
Here are some my thoughts about Glosa, Interglossa and English:
1. Glosa isn't English with LG-vocabulary! Yes, there are some similar
places in constructions of declarative sentence, but neither in negative
one, nor in questions!
2. I propose to use Glosa-dialects' names as RC did. So, Interglossa is
Interglosa, there is also common Glosa, Euro-Glosa, and there will be also
Puta-me-Glosa etc.
3. Why all of you think that Glosa isn't perfect?
I think that there are only some vocabulary problems as in all "young" IALs!
4. The fact that we can use almost all words in Glosa as verbs is very good,
because we have no "idiomatic verbal constructions" from different national
languages!
5. Adjective before noun is the best way. It occurs in all analytic IALs.

Saluta,
Alex.

    It took me longer to get back to this than I had anticipated.  Sorry
for the delay.

    One matter as a general response is the extent to which we discuss
any language other than Glosa.  Although Interglossa was the forerunner
of Glosa, I consider them more or less separate languages.  If others
prefer it, we should probably drop the discussion of IG except insofar
as it sheds light on Glosa, which after all is the subject of this list.

    Yesterday I go to town.  I buy five book.  I eat lunch.  Then I
visit friend, who I visit before.  We talk about many thing.  I come
home.

    Yesterday I went to town.  I bought five books.  I ate lunch.  Then
I visited a friend, whom I had visited before.  We were talking about
many things.  I came home.

    The second paragraph conveys no more real information than the
first, despite the tense, aspect, and number (and even case)
indications.

    I want to make clear that it is NOT somehow "wrong" to use (or
reuse) various particles marking plurality or tense or aspect or
whatever.  They do not somehow violate the grammar of the language (and
we must remember that grammar is much more than morphology*).  It is
just that it is often superfluous to do so.  Also, semantically it can
happen that number or time or whatever is unknown or simply irrelevant,
so there need not be any marking at all, but Indo-European habits can
lead one to think that marking is forced when it is not.

    If Glosa is intended to be used only by people speaking
Indo-European languages, it doesn't really matter.  However, if it is
to be used by people from many different language families (and a man
in China and I once exchanged two letters each way in Glosa), they
might think it strange to keep marking everything unnecessarily, because
to them it is "natural" not to do so.  We must always beware of the
temptation to think that how our native language does things is somehow
"natural" or "the way the mind works."

    (At this point, I will insert something I typed in a long time ago
about misconception of language.  I am not claiming that Eddings' work
is on the level of, say, Tolkien.  It just happens to be a sample I have
ready to hand.)

..........
    Consider the following excerpt from David Eddings' fantasy novel,
"Domes of Fire" (1992).  Eddings' fantasy series "The Elenium" and its
sequel "The Tamuli" are set in a multi-racial, multi-lingual, medieval
world with the common motifs of chivalry, magic, religion, and so on.
Kalten is a brave and likable, but not always bright, Church Knight of
Elenic language, race, and religion, and the Church Knights are trained
to cast spells using the Styric tongue.  Sephrenia is a polyglot wisewoman
of the Styric race.  In this episode, an Elenic party are in the Tamul
Empire and need to learn to speak Tamul.  Incidentally, linguistic theory
is not my point here.  My point is the misjudgment of considering that
one's own language is somehow the "natural" way that all humans think.

        "Kalten, dear," [Sephrenia] said gently, why was I trying
      to teach you Styric?"
        "So that I could perform magic tricks, I guess."  He
      shrugged.  "That's unless you just enjoy making people
      suffer."
        "No, dear one.  It was just as painful for me as it was for
      you."  She shuddered.  "More painful, probably.  You _were_,
      in fact, trying to learn Styric so that you could work the
      spells, but in order to do that, you had to be able to _think_
      in Styric.  You can't just mouth the words and make them come
      off the way you want them to."
        "Wait a minute," he objected.  "Are you saying that people
      who speak other languages don't think the same way we do?"
        "They may think the same way, but they don't think in the
      same words."
        "Do you mean to say that we actually think in words?"
        "Of course we do.  What did you think thoughts were?"
        "I don't know.  But we're all human.  Wouldn't we all think
      in the same way and in the same language?"
        She blinked.  "And which language would that be, dear one?"
        "Elenic, naturally.  That's why foreigners aren't as clever
      as we are.  They have to stop and translate their thoughts from
      Elenic into that barbarian gabble they call language.  They do
      it just to be stubborn, of course."
        She stared at him suspiciously.  "You're actually serious,
      aren't you?"
        "Of course.  I thought everybody knew that's why Elenes are

    Any time a marker (such as a particle or inflection) conveys no
additional information, it is redundant (even if, strictly speaking,
not wrong).

    This becomes a judgment call, and Hogben called it differently from
Clark and Ashby.  In "Interglossa" Hogben writes:

        If we ain at easy recognition and easy association, it is
        fatal to maltreat roots for the task of uniform spelling.
        _Uniformity is less important that consistency._  It does
        not matter whether one sound always has one symbol.  What
        does matter is whether the same symbol stands for only
        one sound. [page 16, italics original]

        The inconvenience of having a few anomilies which go into
        a dozen lines of print is far less that the disadvantage
        which would result from mutilating roots beyone visual
        recognition. [page 30]

        With a few exceptions the vocables of _Interglossa_ are
        based on _unmutilated_ roots of words which now belong to
        the vocabulary of _all_ countries where modern technology
        and hygiene have penetrated. [page 31, italics original]

When I first looked at some of the Glosa wordlists, I did not recognize
some of the "mutilated" roots Hogben was talking about.  I have a good
grounding in English etymologies and smatterings of Greek, Latin, and
French, and I was simply puzzled by some of them at first.  Clark and
Ashby made a different decision from Hogben.  I tend to go with Hogben.

    I think the best example, in the time and energy I have available,
it the very example I gave of verbal structures, the first part of an
example of which is still below.  Glosa's set of verbs is essentially
open (although the set of auxiliaries is more or less closed), just as
the set of verbs of English is open, and the verbs of each language can
be more or less mapped onto the other's (to a degree, anyway).  However,
the set of verbs of Interglossa is small and closed.  It has (more or
less) the same (closed) set of verbal auxiliaries, but unlike both
English and Glosa, it has only eighten verbs (which Hogben calls
"verboids").  All verbal structures are composed with these eighteen
verbs, unlike both English and Glosa.

..........
* Even some constructors of respectable international auxiliary
languages confuse grammar with morphology.  Giuseppe Peano, who
developed (the original) Interlingua, which was also called Latino sine
Flexione, was a mathematician, not a linguist, and he said that the best
grammar is no grammar, confusing grammar with the elaborate inflectional
morphology of Latin, which he discarded in Lsf (the more of which I read
the more I like).  This is on a level with C&A's sometime statement,
"Glosa has no grammar."  A "language" which has no grammar is not a
language.  Glosa, IG, and (nearly) LsF have no _inflections_ but they
certainly have grammars.  We must always take care to use terminology
accurately if we are to be taken seriously.  For instance, the proposed
"tense table" of Glosa would be better named the "verb table," because
it deals with aspect, mood, and voice as well as tenses.  If we are not
sure of the proper use of a technical term, we are better off not to use
it and to say what we want to say in a different way.

Ah. The first thing that strikes me is how much this sounds
like my Chinese-speaking friend speaking English. Which
makes sense, given what I've heard about the Chinese
language (Mandarin, I think).

I now see what you mean about redundancy, although I still
think at times it would be ambiguous whether something is
truly redundant or not. 

"Yesterday I buy book. I wash car." Did I wash the car
yesterday? I think I would need to add something there, but
other people might think it's fine as it is. Other people
might find the second "I" to be unnecessary, as long as
they could tell it was not intended as a command.

Perhaps this would be more a difference between spoken
communication (high-bandwidth) and written, which tends to
be more formal and precise.

On phonemicity, I still prefer simplicity over perfect
reuse of existing roots. And I accept that it is merely a
preference.

I do have concerns about the size of Glosa's vocabulary.
>From where I sit, less is more. I would much rather

words than have to master hundreds or thousands of
additional complete words.

When I use IAL's, I tend to try to confine my writing to
the most common set of words, rather than trying to make my
writing more "interesting". I suppose that's true of my
style in English as well.

Anyway, thanks for the quick lesson in some interesting
corners of the Glosa language.

Kevin

    I just looked back over it, and I see that there were some typos 
I did not catch.  I am a good speller of English, but not so good a
typist and proofreader.

    As far as an analog of tense goes, the time reference remains
constant until you change it.

    Certainly.  In this respect, both IG and Glosa follow Indo-European
habits, although I do not know whether there is any language anywhere
which would elide the second subject.  Pidgins, perhaps?

    As I say, it is a judgment call based in part on one's goals.

    This was Hogben's goal, and as nearly as I can tell, at least the
original goal of Clark & Ashby.  Some of their earlier publications, at
least, claimed that Glosa 1000 would allow you to say at least most
things.  (Although when I collated the various versions of "1000" to
create the original Glosa Basic Reference which I put up on the WWW
with permission, I wound up with more like 1500 words.)  I personally
tend to agree with the idea of a smaller vocabulary for basic
interpersonal communications, probably because I have a deuce of a time
retaining vocabulary.  At first I said that I would hate to see a law
code written in a 1000 word (plus proper names) vocabulary, but I have
read that Tok Pisin (a pidgin English) is used in the Parliament of
Papua New Guinea and that Australian radio broadcasts some in Tok
Pisin.  Also, the world news service of the Voice of America (I think
that is it) uses a restricted vocabulary of about 1800 words plus
proper names.  So with judicious choices it can be done.

*   Hello Kevin,
   I write in English because the concepts are tricky, and it takes longer
to work out the right expressions in Glosa. 
   In English we abbreviate our usage a lot and often leave out words -
this is called elision. (Verb: to elide)  EG. "I went home."  ~Mi pa ki a
mi domi.~
    We can say "The dog went him." - but this is slang.
    In Glosa we can't correctly use the concept 'go' in relation to the
concept 'home.'  
    In Engish we describe "go" as intransitive: it does not take a Direct
Object.  So "I go to my home." is the unelided form; "to my home" is an
Indirect Object.  

    You have asked about Interglossa, and I have gone off at a grammatical
tangent.
    But Grammar is the crux of the difference between Interglossa and its
decendent, Glosa.
    I do have a copy of Hogben's book, but only pull it out when someone
goes (back) to asking questions about the earlier language: I see the
relationship as an evolutionary one.  Having spent time talking to Ron
Clark and to Wendy Ashby, I am pragmatically promoting Glosa, not
Interglossa, because I feel that Clark and Ashby did a good job in
vivifying the basic language that Hogben produced. 
    On the few occasions that I tried to create sentences using
Interglossa, I found its structure rather blocky, and not yielding to human
tendencies - possibly I can describe the feeling as 'angular' and not
'flowing.'  It seemed like a formula language.

    When I first met Ron, in 1977, he was still struggling to make Hogben's
angular structures work.  In 1978 Ron Clark returned to the drawing board,
knowing that the basic specification of Interglosa was sound, but that the
syntax needed loostening up. It was at this stage that Ron did serious work
on the structure of Verb Phrases in what he was then calling Euro Glossa.
He was concentrating on making the language usable by scientists, for
international communication.  Also, he took into account the newly invented
electronic computers, and, as well as that, wished to get the language
flowing - so that it felt more amenable to human syntax.

   While Paul finds linguistic interest in Interglossa, I see it as only
having purely historical interest - as the parent of Glosa.

   With apologies, I cannot find the time to check through Hogben's book to
search for example to make comparisons.  When you see the language written,
it looks much like the present Glosa, with only a few words with different
roots or different spelling, and some rearrangements in the verb phrases.  

EG p109       Mi pre kine apo; pre fe kine para.

               I went away before she came here.


 p130         Id eque geno re; an esthe hedo.

               It is the sort of thing he likes.


 p184         Mu habe cliesto in quo geno?

               How are they related? 

It might take a while to get yourself a copy of "Interglossa": few were
printed, the flimsy war-time paper is disintegrating, and they are
"collectors' items".

Saluta,

Robin Gaskell

*   Thanks Charles for this clear restatement of your ideas.

     # Some level of optionality in word order at the start - allowing learners to filter into Glosa from different language traditions. 

     # Optional additon of a couple of extra particles to allow learners to specify the transitive ~em~, and for indirect objects ~per~.

     # Functionally using _particles_ similar to _inflections_ - but maintaining the separateness as either discrete words or hyphenated pre- or post- fixes.

     # Glosa prefers prepositions (including articles and tense markers) to suffixes/inflections. With a well-designed set of  articles/quantifiers, one should be able to avoid number-marking *and* monotony.

     # "Allow optional marking.  Design the lang so it's easy to get right, difficult to be wrong. 

        *** This is, I feel, beautifully put. ***

     # Allowing optional marker-particles, but ensuring people use these consistently.

     #%%  Since all nations pronounce Latin and Greek roots differently

but recognize them visually, the cleverest solution is to *keep the spelling* and *change the pronunciation*.

        %%%This is the one idea I find clashing%%%

     # For certain language traditions:- "If there were a few particles added to differentiate adjectives from nouns, then a true-to-itself Glosa could also accommodate relexing from Spanish, French, and Japanese. 100% of the languages of the world would be easy to relex into Glosa, *and back again*."

          *** Yes, were we able to introduce transitive phases, where learners with different habitual ways of thinking about language, were able to ^shoe-horn^ themselves into Glosa, by bringing - for a transitional period only - some particle that had a similar feel to those of their native tongue, then we would have a funnel by which most people could gradually merge into using Glosa.***  [This would need some serious thinking.] 

     # With keeping some of the "verboid" concept of Interglossa, there are definitely compound "verbs" in Glosa, but these are set structures, and not idiosyncratic forms that have grown out of usage.  Agreed, importing idiomatic phrasal verbs - from any other language - into Glosa is wrong

     # "It is a productive and inevitable process of language, to build up complex verbs from simpler components.  The alternative of 5000 Romance verbs is not workable."

        ***Not every word in "GLOSA 6000" can be 'verbed', but having a discrete and unique lexical unit for every concept is an unnecessary burdon on learners - and wrong, when it prevents the grouping of similar concepts into a word-family, in which compound "verbs" contained the same verboid.***

     # [There was an experiment by Jeffrey Henning to try to reduce roots to a minimum.]  "A base vocab of particles and verbs and such, minus the world of things and names, could be kept under 1000. Glosa as an "isolating" type of language should be able to borrow specific nouns freely, without impacting its structure."

         *** Yes, excluding the 'concretes' and proper nouns, 1000 lexical items (function-words, actions and modifiers) would cover most people's needs.***


   So, there are two or three hurdles to cross: can the linguistic fraternity be convinced that a phased learning process is acceptable; who is going to do the work in setting up the various pathways into Glosa; and will the world be able to live with an auxiliary language that might contain elements of two, or more, of its ontological pathways - as still persist in Modern English, and, I understand, in modern Greek.

   Would people be able to live with the concept of an auxiliary language that was not monolithic, but which allowed untidy optionalities to facilitate learning?

   Ron Clark did visualise a series of three major usages of Glosa.  At the plebian level a basic vocabulary and fairly loose syntax might apply; at the second, or scholarly, level, a wider vocabulary put together using a tighter, more proscribed syntax, would ensure ready, global interaction at the academic, scientific and commercial level; and, for the third, legal, level, a highly specified lexicon with a tightly controlled syntax would apply - ensuring as much exactitude as written language permits.

   What Ron Clark suggested, can be visualised in the vertical direction (or Y axis);  while the suggestions from Charles can be pitured as a broadening of Glosa on the basal plane (or X and Z axes).


   Prior to reading Charles' post, I had not thought in terms of introducing a Planned Language through parallel, but slightly different, pathways.  However, the precedent is there with the Initial Teaching Alphabet(ITA) for children: while the young can cut back from eighty different 'sound/letters' to the standard twenty-six - after their achieving fluency, will adult learner be anywhere near as flexible with the learning of Glosa?

   Owing to my knowlege of only Glosa and English, I would be able to participate in such a project more as a consultant; though, I would be happy to do as much as I could, of the planning and developmental work.


   What does the group think of this initiative of Charles'?  Is it feasible, in the practical world; and would hard-nosed Linguists accept the concept, in the theoretical world?  Or don't we have to worry about possible theoretical concerns, if it works, practically?

   How many volunteers?


Is this what "Proba" was all about?

    I will just respond to the last thing Robin wrote, for general
interest.

    There is an excellent source for used books (at least in English)
on the world wide web, the Advanced Book Exchange (abebooks).  The URL 
is

http://www.abebooks.com

The Advanced Search option is especially useful.  Certainly, not every
used bookseller is listed, but many in the US and the UK are.  I found
my copy of "Interglossa" from a British bookseller who was only asking
GB£5 (plus air post charge) for a copy in quite good condition.  I also
discovered another hard-to-find conIAL book on abebooks, as well as
some highly technical, non-language books.  It is an excellent resource.

    A practical suggestion to all, whether for mailing lists or
newsgroups.  When you give a URL to a web site, always include the
http://
in fromn of the address.  Some mail agents (such as mine) can pick off
the address without the http:// but some cannot.  If you include it,
you are making it more likely that more readers will be able to go
directly to the web site from their email if they want to do so.

    Actually, I tend to agree when considering Glosa as itself.  Whether 
or not I am an active Glosa-pe (and I admit that I am not), and whatever
constructed auxiliary languages I might prefer, I do think that
structurally Glosa is workable.  As Alexander says, and I agree, there
are only some vocabulary issues to be resolved.  Come up with a
consistent, standard, and adequate (whatever that means) vocabulary,
and you have a usable language.

I usually do include that http, for sysmmetry with urls using other
mechanisms, but explicitly chose to drop it in this case, since that's
how Robin listed the corresponding URL in his signature. When in Rome...

As for picking off web addresses in mail agents... I'm even more
old-school than you are, Paul, haha! I highly disapprove of such
behavior. Mail programs are for mail (which should be plain ASCII
text) and should know nothing of the Web. While I don't actively
fight such behavior, and even occasionally use it, I would not use
the enabling of it as justification in situations like this. That
is, including http is the right thing to do, but for a different
reason.

As for html in mail... yeccchhhh! It may become common for regular
purposes in the future, but in my world mail with html is usually
advertisement, whether unsolicited (spam) or not. I've been tempted
to filter all html mail, but I get just enough nonspam html mail
to discourage that.

Yep, I've always considered Glosa's grammar to be the thing that sets
it apart. Occasionally while struggling with the dictionaries I toyed
with the thought of applying Glosa's grammar to Esperanto's vocabulary.
I never really did anything much with that idea, but was amused to find
this bit a couple of years later, quoted in Pierre Janton's "Esperanto:
Language, Literature, and Community": "In the only place in which Zamenhof
describes the linguistic theory that he used to create his language",
he said...

#  I have arranged the language to allow for the *analysis*
#  of ideas into independent words, so that the entire
#  language, instead of consisting of words in various
#  grammatical forms, is made up exclusively of *unchanging*
#  [invariant] words. If you take a text written in my
#  language, you will find that every word appears *always*
#  in one invariant form *only*, namely in that form in
#  which it is printed in the dictionary. And the various
#  grammatical forms, the reciprocal relations among the
#  words, and so on, are expressed through the combination
#  of invariant words. But because a linguistic structure
#  of this kind is entirely foreign to European peoples
#  and it would be difficult for them to grow used to it,
#  I have presented this analytical aspect of the language
#  in a completely different way, in conformity with the
#  spirit of the European languages, so that anyone learning
#  my language with a textbook, without having read the
#  introduction first (which is quite unnecessary to the
#  learner), would not even imagine that the construction of
#  this language differed from his or her mother tongue. The
#  word "fratino", for example, in reality consists of three
#  words: "frat" 'brother', "in" 'woman', "o" ('something
#  that is, or exists') (= that which is a brother-woman
#  = 'sister'). But the textbook explains "fratino" as
#  follows: 'brother' is "frat", and it ends in "-o" because
#  all nouns end in "-o" in the nominative, hence "frat'o";
#  to indicate the female form of this same idea, we add the
#  small word "in", hence "frat'in'o"; and the apostrophes
#  are added to show the constituent grammatical parts of
#  the word. In this way the *analytical* nature of the
#  language in no way embarrasses the student; he does not
#  even suspect that what he calls an ending or a prefix or
#  a suffix is, in fact, an entirely free-standing word,
#  which carries the same meaning whether it comes at the
#  beginning or end of another word or stands on its own;
#  that every word can be used equally as a root-word or as
#  a grammatical particle. [Zamenhof 1903: 234-35]

Interesting, no?

    Actually, I do, too.  But, as I mentioned, my mail agent, Pine
under Linux, takes the approach, "If it looks like a duck,......"
What does surprise me, to some extent, is that some of these supposedly
"modern" tools do *not* pick off a malformed URL.

    Indeed.  I am more interested in substance than in flash and
glitter.  I have rarely, if ever, found *any* HTML-ized mail that had
any real added content over plain text.  I am currently among the ranks
of the unemployed (got laid off), but in the two-plus years that I
worked for one company which used M$ Outlook, I found that the fancy
features were more harm than help.

Still not sending correctly. Perhaps some other AOL prisoner
(I used to have AOL in 1995 or so ... but escaped)
can give you the magic option bits to cure the problem.

I'm basically just thinking along the lines of Peano's Interlingua as
compared to Glosa, the idea of using Greco-Latin roots with analytic
prepositioning grammar. Unless some other people "pick up on" the idea,
I'll probably never do anything much with it.

    I will only respond to a point here and there.  (By the way, the
odd formatting is an artifact of the way my mailer handled the
non-standard formatting it received.)

    I have long disagreed with the idea of allowing free word order 
in an international auxiliary language, at least in straight prose.
Suppose I am trying to learn Language X (natural or constructed).  If
it has a customary word order, I can learn it and depend on it even if
that word order differs from that of my native language.  However, if
the word order is relatively free, I am always struggling to keep my
footing, as it were.  Relatively free word order just increases the
learning burden, something that should be lessened as much as possible,
not increased.  The languages of the world are diverse enough that no
matter what language -- natural or constructed -- we choose and use,
SOMEBODY is going to be at a disadvantage over SOME characteristic(s)
of the language.  I see no way around this unpleasant fact.

    Beautifully put, yes, but I don't think that it is possible.  I
will, however, consider arguments.

    Of reforms there is no end.  I myself, as I have stated previously,
think that structurally Glosa is workable as is, with no changes
needed.  For me the only issue is vocabulary selection.  Once an IAL is
good enough, then it is good enough, and endless tinkering just impedes
use and promotion.  In the end, linguistic characteristics are NOT the
most important factors in the spread and use of a conIAL.  Just look at
Esperanto.

> Is this what "Proba" was all about?

    No.  According to "Glosa 6000," 'proba' means "test, trial."  Right
after I re-subscribed to the list, I was wondering whether I was having
email problems, so "Proba" was nothing more, originally, than a test
message.  A thread developed, keeping the same Subject.

Word order or constituent order? The 2nd is practically unavoidable.
And then, how to handle participial constructions? Glosa basically
can't handle them at all, which makes writing anything more than
a few sentences very difficult.

But even limited to just the adj-noun vs. noun-adj issue, half of Europe
and half of the world are going to have difficulty; maybe, that's just
part of the cost to be paid -- but Occidental and similar IALs avoid it.

Glosa isn't, and has essentially zero user base to worry about losing.
I'm not interested in a "freeze it" vs. "reform" debate, I consider it
beyond reasonable doubt that reform or disappearance is Glosa's future.
So rather than argue it, I'd prefer to discuss the major features that
most people would want to keep in Glosa, or see appear in a revision
or similar new effort. If nobody else agrees, I've said my piece.

I really beg your pardon for not writing in Glosa but English which even
isn't my own language so I am in fact using it as an international
language. On the other hand I don't think it correct to use the language I
would use in principal for international communication.

Now ad rem! Free word order is generally a misunderstanding. When learning
Latin I was told that the word order was so free! This is not true. It
looks free, much like a nomad people looks free to the antropologist who
comes to study these people roaming the deserts. They don't see the little
limitation, the unseen relations etc. Same with free word order languages.
You can use word order for emphasis, to show whether a word should take
the article if you translate it or a lot of other things, so what looks as
free word order in most cases might not be that.

Glosa belongs to the type of international auxiliary languages that need a
very strong PR base and lots of people to use it. In comparison to languages
like Interlingua and Occidental that I could profit from even if I were the
only speaker of them, Glosa needs, like Esperanto and Ido a very strong
promotion base.

This is not to be understood as a playing down of their value, just that
they have to be propagated in another way.

As far as I can understand Glosa is wrong from its very start. It would need
a lot of work to get flying.

Well, Glosa did teach me some Greek words. I don't
bump into those very often, well, explicitly anyway!

I think Glosa's weak web presence (especially up until
recently) has been a problem. My perception of it was that
much of the material was "closed", and only available on
paper, for a fee. Certainly a turn-off in this day and age.
I think it is better now, but not yet as open and available
as it should be.

Glosa needs to be good enough, in a dramatic way, to catch
people's attention, and then hold it. I think the
syntax/grammar/whatever you want to call it does that. I
don't see major problems with the variance of trailing
vowels, nor with the repetition of pa and whatever.

So what would it take for ME to start using Glosa on this
list, at least? Hmmm. I guess I would need to take another
look at the Glosa 1000 list. If it's freely available,
seems stable, and enough other people can agree to use it,
then I think I'm on board.

With a core group of maybe ten people using Glosa as the
primary language for this list, it should start to grow. I
would encourage people who post in Glosa to include an
English translation too, to allow part-timers to understand
the material, and practice their translation.

After that, it's a matter of getting the news out to the
world at large. Mentions on personal Websites, getting into
search engines and dmoz, etc. We would need to write
stories, articles and other samples so people have lots of
Glosa to read and learn from.

Can Glosa become widely popular? I have no idea. I just
know that I prefer Glosa (as-is) over Esperanto, Lojban,
and every other auxlang that I've evaluated. If any one of
them is going to win the popularity race, I would prefer it
be Glosa.
